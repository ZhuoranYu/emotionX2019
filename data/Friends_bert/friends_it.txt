I was also the reference person on the transition of my company from the KL-5 system to the GR-6 system.
You must have had your hands full.
What I did. What I did.
Let's talk a little about your duties.
My duties? All right.
Now you will be in charge of an entire division, so you will have many duties.
I see.
But there will be maybe 30 people under you so you can download a certain amount on them.
Good to know.
We can go into the details
No, please do not!
All right, we'll have a definitive answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence that you'll be fine here.
Really?!
Absolutely. You can relax; you did well.
But then who? The waitress came out with last month?
You know? Forget about it!
No-no-no-no, no! Whose person were you talking about?
No, I_I_I_I do not, actually I do not know
Ok!
All right, good ...
I'll see if I can find a room for the night and I ...
See you later!
Yes sure!

Hey, Monday
Hey Hey Hey. You want to hear something that sucks.
I never do it.
Chris says they're closing the bar.
There's no way!
Yes, apparently they are turning it into a type of coffee.
Only coffee! Where will we go out now?
You got me
Can I have a beer
Hey, did you choose a roommate?
I bet!
Is he the Italian boy?
Um-mm, yes right!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What what what ?!
What?!
He was with her when he wrote this poem.
Look, 'My ship is so empty with nothing in it.
Now that I have touched you, you seem even more empty. "
Think that Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Do you really think that's what he meant?
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Done.

Hey!
Hello!
What are you doing here?
Ah, you know, this building is on my paper path so ...
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
How did it go?
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but thank God, Mark trained me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she became happy and did not want to be quiet.
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry for being so crazy and jealous and it's just that I like you a lot, so ...
I know.
Yes.
Yes.
American.
Ameri-Ccan.
American. You know, it's a
All!!

Good job Joe! Very well! First quality!
Did you like it? Did you really like it?
Oh-ho-ho, yes!
Which part exactly?
The whole thing! We can go?
Oh no-no-no, give me some details.
I love the specifications, the specifications were the best part!
Hey, and the scene with the kangaroo? Did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in an epic from the First World War.
You fell asleep!!
There was no kangaroo!
They did not take any of my suggestions!
This is for the next friend.
See you later.
Do not go!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!
Look!
This boy fell asleep!
He too fell asleep!
Be angry with him!
Or call an ambulance.

Ok, look, I think we have to tell Rachel that she messed up her dessert.
What?! What is with everyone? It's Thanksgiving, not ... The day of truth!
Yes, and it is my desire to die of having that ring.
See, if I am not buried with that ring, then my spirit will wander the lower world for all eternity
Ok, it's enough for me!
I do not know. Show me the ring.
Great! Ok, here.
All right.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! IS

What have you done?
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying too much.
Oh, and in case you're wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you wait a moment? I have another call. I love her.
I know.
I'm back.
So, will we meet or what?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how's it going tomorrow afternoon? You know, Central Perk in the Village, for example, five-ish?
Well, see you then.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid.
Even if you make a good impression on Bob, I think when he sees you tomorrow, he'll probably realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
I hope that when Bob does not show up, he will seek comfort in the open arms of the ironic stranger at the next table.
My God. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I did it

Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You would not believe what people put here!
Look!
Ok, this looks like a trash can?
No.
This is my marriage
All right, you know what? We are really late! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!!
Beautiful. You'll see it on video when we come back.
Here go Phoebe! Here go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
OK let's go! Hi, Phoebe!
Hi, Phoebe!
Little London !!
Oh, do you need a hug? You do not have to bring me anything!

Hey!
Hey! So Estelle has organized a couple of hearings for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance in no time.
It's great, but should not you be in the bathroom right now?
What?!
What's wrong with you?
Anything!
Well, I had this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights first, then I fainted and since then I have not been able to stand up.
But um, I do not think it's serious.
It looks like a hernia. You must-you-go to the doctor!
There's no way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it will be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
It is a hernia.
Why do I have to start working again? Damn you 15s!

I love your place! Where is this guy coming from?
This is an 18th century Indian artifact of Calcutta.
Oh wow! So you are more than just a dinosaur.
Much more.
Well, to sum up, we're having fun, you're young.
All right
But it's not enough. So, here is a key to my apartment.
Really?!
Really.
Do not you think it's too fast.

Go out!
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes thanks! So, what's going on?
Uh, well ... Joey and I broke up.
Oh my God, what happened?
Joey is a good guy, but we're just ... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
I knew it was him!
Anyway, I think it's the best.
Hey, are you okay?
I presume.
There was a buzz ... there was another reason why I thought it was time to close it with Joey.
I started to realize that I was feeling for someone else.
Ok Geller. On the last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Oh, professor, we're in the middle of a conversation here.
Yes, can you guys throw it in the pool later?
Or we could throw you both inside
OK, gentlemen!
Please!
Are not we old for this?
I mean, we're scientists, right?
We are academics.
And, more importantly, I ... you must first catch it.
.
STREET! STREET! STREET!

Street! Street! Street!
Oh yes, now everyone wants to be under this hat!
Oy !!
What's all this sand?
Oh yes, Bob said there could be flood damage.
Yes, or that, or have a really big cat.

Ok, see that blind right there? I will chase his head later.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming. Great scene coming soon.
If you said: "Big bean of a file, that boils". Will you understand the difference?
Rachel? What are you doing?
Oh boy, I can not watch. It's too scary!
It's a diaper advertisement.
Oh yes, well, you know me, children, responsibility, ahhh !!!
Pizza delivery!
I'll get it! I'll take it!
Hello!
Hello!
Hey, do you want something to eat or want to see how long can we throw this ball back and forth? Eh?
Uhh, the thing about the ball.
Yes?
Hey, Ross, would not it be nice if we could go two hours without letting her fall?
uhh,
All right!
Uh Oh.
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel is in the bathroom!
Friend, I did not think we could do it!
I know! Do not change hands, ok?

Hey.
Hey!
How did you go with Erin?
Oh, incredible! We had great fun!
Yay!! Oh, you're not, are you no longer angry with us?
No!
No!
No!
You guys are completely right!
This is much better than the first time we went out.
You know?
It was so embarrassing, we were really nervous.
Did not you sleep together?
Yes, this really reassures me.
IS!
We have so much in common!
Love the sandwiches, the sport, even if you are a fan of the Met, it's not a big deal now, but if we ever have children, well this is a
My God! Listen, you talk about having children. Oh my Joey. Oh, please do not get married before me.
All right.

How do you do it?
I can not sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Oh! What what thing! ...Hello.
All right, you know, you just nodded again.
What's going on with you?
I did not sleep last night!
Why?
My grandma has this new boyfriend and they are both insecure in bed.
Oh, and deaf.
So they are constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they are having fun.
You have no idea how strong they are!
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thank you.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
It is only his water that breaks. Calm down, do you want?
Water that breaks, what do you mean? What is a water break?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

You are crazy? I mean Joey, he will kill you, he will actually kill you dead.
All right! Do not you think I thought about it?
How can you not know which one?
I mean it's incredible.
I mean, was it Gina?
What is Gina?
Dark and big hair, with airplane earrings.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
See that you can not say what it is or not, dwha !!
I do not know, you thought "see you Saturday" was fun.
Look, honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend with whom I can share this stuff.
You guys would never want to go to a class with me.
Pa-haa !! I'd like to come with you.
Really!?
Yes, hey I-I have clothes, I pick them too.
I mean, for all you know, I could be a fashion ... more powerful.
All right. Honey, I'd like you to come with me. What?
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.

: I know, we did it !! Hey, it was incredible, eh ?!
I know, it was great! I mean, we completely nailed it, it was beautiful.
: Thank you, listen, thank you so much Tribbiani ,. Oh my God, look at the time, I have to take the bus to the ball.
Oh, all right, good luck
: Yes.
Unless you want to practice Foxtrot again? Or or the Tango?
: Ahh, thanks but no. See, I think I'm ready to dance with the girls.
All right.
: Yes.
Go look for them, Treeger.
: Right. Hey, do you want to come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really?
: Yes, you could dance really well with her, she's the same size as me.
No, I'm fine.

Oh God, this is so unnerving! How do you do this?
Well, unfortunately, I do not have many callbacks
Is it a good sign that they asked us to stay around after the audition?
Who knows?
Okay, we narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yup!! I knew it!! Bye Bye! So long! After!
Oh, it's great! I could really play Ben's father!
Yes!
In reality, this can not happen.
Yes, because you all look so different, we are putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
So it will be either you or two of you.
Friend, it will be a little strange.
Yes it is.
No, we'll be like best friends, that's why it will be weird.

Ok, come on, I can not marry until I have something old, something new, something lent and something blue.
All right, all right, all right, all right! All right! Ok, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Please!
Are you kidding?
I ... I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a damn nose - I mean - I'm not proud of it, but I really am.
And it's all for you, wonderful, fantastic.
I think you have a concussion.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
You are welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Pain is worth it. You know what, you know what? It is not.

Wow! Mike's thing was interesting! I do not know what will happen with Phoebe and David.
I want it! Do you want a suggestion? eh? "I do" "I do".
Ok, I'm sensing that it's a kind of word game, because you're rose with barely controlled joy.
David is about to propose to Phoebe.
What? Why?
Be-Cause, we were talking about ways he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Chandler, we talked about it.
You should not give advice to people!
Now you could not have done some kind of inappropriate joke?
I
They've only been out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely stunned by Mike!
She will say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too difficult for them to recover and Phoebe will end up alone
Friend, this is a bit
Oh, that's not what you want ...

This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, it's Ross Geller.
It's nice to meet you Paul.
Usually I prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to call me Mr. Stevens.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
So Ross, what's your problem?
Eh-wh-excuse me?
Why can not you have a girl your age?
It is funny. Umm. It's not funny.
I
All right.
I can, I can see it.
Umm, but I think if you give me a chance, I can change my mind.
All right.
What?
All right. I'll give you a chance to change your mind. Do you have a minute.
Pope!
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Ok, well, I'll bring you a ribbon, eh?
So, do you have any Matt Lauer clothes here now? Could be? Only those who have not been cleaned yet?

Ooooohh!
Oh yes, I'm sure. And suddenly his hands were no longer the problem.
Was...?
Oh, the Boy Scouts could have camped there.
"Ooo", what?
Uma Thurman.
Oh!
The actress!
Thanks, Rach.
So, what are you going to do?
You must tell him!
You must tell him!
It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist question!
Guys?
Guys?
Oh yes, you have to tell him.
Feminist Problem That's where I went!
He will hate me.
Yes good...

Do you want to marry me?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you luck!
Yes, yes, do you have a ring?
Yes, right here in my pocket. Phoebe?
Oh! Oop!
Ok, now you're going out of here? I want this to be a surprise and she will know it.
Yes, yes, guys. Go out of here!
Hi guys.
You are beautiful.
Oh thanks! What is going on?
We are really very excited about this charity event we have to go to.

Ok, um, Ross?
I'm very hot, so I'll take off my sweater.
Now I'm just letting you know that this is it
Yup! It is funny!
I'm sorry. I finished. I finished.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. I mean, you saw me naked a hundred times.
Uh Huh. But it was the first time for the rest of my building.
All right. All right, it's true! But you only know that I do not easily embarrass him.
What?! You are totally embarrassed!
No I do not know! Ross, I think I'm just a safer person than you.
Is that so?
Yes.
Hey girl! I do not care how much you want it! All right?! I'm

I can not believe!
I did it!
I drove a bike!
I never thought I would be able to do it!
Thanks, Ross.
Oh hey, do not thank me, thank you. You are the one who has faced his fears and in the end has overcome them.
Well, yes, but then
Yes-No-ma-ma-ma-ma! We will go home and take a shower. Now, it's not scary, is it?
It depends on what you mean with us.

Hey, you guys both should be up there with me.
I mean, you two are ... it's me, I mean, I'm lucky to have only one good
Thanks man.
I have to go check something out here.
What a baby.
Total Wuss!

David?
Phoebe! Hello!
My God!
Wow, you look incredible.
Yes. What-what are you doing here?
Well, I came back from Minsk ... permanently.
What happened?
Well, remember how I was trying to get positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Yes?
Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can not be done.
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
Well, well, life is good ...
Good!
Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
Oh, good for you.
She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and ... well, it's actually thanks to you, really, that we're together, that is, I saw what you had with that guy from Mike, and I just said "Boy , I want it".
Mike and I broke up.
It means we can keep trying, but chances are good that this never happens for us.
My God!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Well, we'll do it ... we'll find out.
I know.

Ok, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes to try.
Wow! This looks fantastic!
Yes! Ok, this is a mushroom hat. Umm, this is made of bologna.
E-e-e-e-e toothpicks?
You kissed another woman!
Call it too?
All right!
Well, I'm going to get them in the water.
Wait you stole those from these people's marriage?
No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby.
Yes, they think they can make me pay for a dirty movie and a lot of Mashuga nuts, they have another thought coming up.
Hey!
My sweater!
I've been looking for him for a month!
My God!!
My God!

Happy?! Is that what I should be Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you should be!
Eh?
Because for sure I can not understand it!
I talk to you and nothing.
You look at me, and it's nothing.
Anything.
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel that you guys have a story, it's ... it's beautiful.
I have a question about this scene.
Yup?
Well, I do not understand why Adrienne is attracted to Victor.
Peel the onion First of all, it is good-looking.
Yes.
I think my character will need another bit of reason.
Oh, hey, how about this.
Ah, he says it in the script!
You know ah, I-I do not know why my character is nice too, I mean he says in the script you're a bitch.
He does not say it in the script.
He does it in mine!

I can not
Yes! You must tell a girl before registering. Such a beginner's mistake.
Do you know who has a big video camera?
Greg and Jenny?
Do you still want to call them? I want to call them.
Let's call them.
Yes! Ask them if they brought some souvenirs to their friends!
Hello? Eighth street food?
Hey, hang up! You have food poisoning that only talks in that place.
Uh sorry, wrong number.
Here it is.
Hello? It is again the gastronomy!
All right! I will have a sandwich!
I do not think this number is right!
Oh come on !!

I have to go. I miss you too, I love you, but now it's getting very late
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with dr. Bazida and ... Excuse me? Did you know it's not Ma?
His name is Ronni. She is a misfit.
Sure. So how long ...
Remember when you were a kid, I took you to the navy yard and showed you the big ships?
Since?!
No, it's only been six years.
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head, so you'd know I was not always such a terrible guy.
... Joe.
Have you ever been in love?
... I know.
So you will not do it. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk.
Joe, your father is in love with the big one. And the worst part is that it's with two different women.
Oh God. Please tell me that one of them is Ma.
Of course, of course, one of them is Ma. What's the problem with you?

Everything will be fine. Ok, Dick?
Hi, I'm Guru Saj - Whoa !! It should be a duck, right? Because otherwise, this is out of my reach.
Hey, Rach, what was the job like?
Oh great. Even though I sat there where there was not a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped a box of your stuff.
Oh, well, I think I did.
I'll throw it out, it's probably just a little shampoo and ...
Something wrong?
Nothing.

And then, and then you said that, about bringing the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Yes, it is?
Yes.
Yes!!
We're teeth, Zack people!

Friend, I'm sorry for what I said!
No, no, you're right, it's a ridiculous name!
It's not that bad.
Yup! From now on, I do not have the first name.
So you're just Bing?
Because we won our apartment!
What? Ace is tall! Jack, queen, king, ace!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I do not know. Ooh! Ooh! Watch it! Ah-ha!
All right, cut, resume, resume.
All right.
Come to the apartment! Come to the apartment! Oh! I know the queen is tall!
Uh-huh, not as high as it worked! King!
Yeah baby!
But let's get back! We choose again!
Why?!
I do not know!
Tickets please! This is the backyard child!
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so angry for? They bring the apartment back!
No they did not!

You know, I do not think we've brought enough things. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
It will be worth it.
It is known that women love children, all right?
Women love boys who love children.
It's all sensitive.
Soon, point it at that pack of girls there.
Perhaps one of them will break away.
No, no, wait, to get them, we have one, hard on the left.
All right, give me the baby.
No, I got it.
No, seriously.
Oh, seriously, do you want it?
Hello.
Well, do not do it, do not think immodest, but me?
Do you want to hear it?
Oh yeah. He has that great smell as a child. Get a breath of his head.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
Well, we're big boys.
Hello.

Well, not really.
I mean technically it's - it's not against the rules or anything, but it's frowned upon.
Especially from that professor we came across last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well, Ross, be careful now. You do not want to have a reputation as you know Professor McNailshststudents.
Yes. What-what should I do?
Well, Ross, it seems clear enough.
I mean, what's more important?
What do people think or how do you feel, eh?
Ross, you must follow your heart.
Joey is so sweet.
Hey.
Hey Hey Hey! So, how did you go with Dana? Any reason why I should leave an open time say Thursday?
I could not do it
Could not you do it?
Hey, relax, I just need more time. Let's go to dinner tonight.
What?! You'll go out with her again!
Go out with whom?
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah! Was not she?
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Joey! You did not even know her!
Ah, anything!

Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot friend ?!
Do not touch it!
All right!
All right.
Umm, Wayne is fine, at my level.
All right?
I keep hearing all these rumors that I could be fired.
Ok, they also have actors who come to read for my part!
Come on, buddy, you give me a second chance!
I mean, I love - I love this little guy!
Ha ha !!
Ok, that's why you did not want me to touch it, right?
Here it is!
All right?
Stupid!
I can not believe!
God!
Hey how's it going'?

Hey.
Hello. Look, about what happened before ...
No, hey, well, I-I understand perfectly. You were stressed.
I would have given you the chance to apologize to me.
For what? For allowing me to throw myself out of your office?
You did not have
Yes, well, I'm sorry for the desire to be with my girlfriend for our anniversary, boy, what the hell is me.
But I told you, I did not have the time!
Yes, well, you never have the time. I mean, I do not even feel like having a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Wh, Ross, what do you want from me?
You want me, do you want me to leave my job to make you feel like you have a girlfriend?
I know.
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
What?
But I can not tell you.
Ok, but it would not be easier if you had to tell me something you could tell me.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But no, I promised I would not say it, and I swore to love all my gods.
All right. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
No.
Does it have to do with Joey?
No.
Does it have to do with ... with Chandler and that sock he's holding next to his bed?
No, but let's go back to the next one!

Hello!
Richard!
In fact, I'm not here to complete the chef.
Ohh Oh, all right, I hate when people come back to complete the chef.
As if I had nothing better to do!
So what's up?
Well, it was nice to see you the other night.
Oh, nice to see you too. Did you come here to tell me?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you that I still love you.

A pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be well.
So forcing her to marry Bobby will make it happen?
Could be! Well! Well, so, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can not!
Joey, I'm scared to death for this.
But I really think I can do it, I just need help.
And Bobby will be here all the time.
You bet! And to answer your previous question, we are rap-rapists.
Look, Rachel told me it's so much easier than you did all of this on her. Why can not you do it for me?
Why! Because you are my little sister!
And you are my elder brother!
I mean, you're my favorite boy all over the world.
I'm not even afraid to tell Mom and Dad.
I was afraid to tell you.
Well, I'd be scared of them, but it's okay.
Joey, I can not bear the thought of having this child with you angry with me.
I want you to have your uncle.
Will my child have his uncle Joey?
Of course he will have his uncle Joey!
We'll all be fine. I mean, even if we are not married, this child will be so loved. Not just from us.
Quite right! Even from his uncle!
And you.
Okay, Bobby, why do not we come here and have a little time.
Come here!
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you ?!

I was very good tonight.
Me too. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd like to ask you to come in, but my sister is visiting and I think she sleeps on the couch.
Are you sister? Is your sister asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw
Oh hey, well, you're awake. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Hello!
Nice to meet you. I wish you had told me that we were keeping company, I would settle!
I'd like to help.
You're so bad!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You're so dead! I will get you.
Uh, it was very nice to meet you.

Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something ... something good.
Hi mom, it's Jill.
He's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. My God. I'm trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
Yes I'm fine. I'm just stuck in the bank, in an ATM atrium.
Jill says vestibule ... I'm going with the vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone ... I do not know, a boy.
Oh! Someone. Someone. "Hey, Jill, I saw you with a guy last night

I say, Drew!
Are you seeing someone right now?
Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for myself, I mean No, I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out.
I'm not ... I'm not ... I'm not gay!
Personal shopping? What is that? Do you like where you go around with haughty people and tell them what to buy?
Uh Huh.
Sounds good!
Hey!
Umm, excuse me, we changed apartments. You can not eat more food, that ... the weight train was over.
Is there any sauce?
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people who come all the time.
That fridge needs to be replenished, okay, this is your department now.
What are you doing?
I think I left a donut here.

So, in conclusion, the lines go up all the way, so I'm happy.
Great work team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.
Phil!
Good job.
Stevens!
Well done!
Joel-burg, maniac!
I love you!
Bing!
Good job, I could not have done it without you.
Thank you sir.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my file, by chance.
Of course you did it.
You forgot something else, you're a bastard!
Well what about you?
Do not you feel excluded or something are you?
No. No, absolutely not, it's ridiculous.
Everyone has one and you want one too. It's not true?
Yes Yes Yes!
Now go away from here, you!

Hey, Bob.
Hey! How's my friend Toby doing today?
If I see it, I ask.
Toby!
Hey-hey! Bing? Bob was talking about six? Were you just talking?
Yes!
Oh, then you know each other.
We are based on the name of semi-first name.
What do you think of adding it to our team?
Bob? Ooh, do you work here with us? Everyday? Yes, I do not know if he has what it takes.
Really? They love it down at six.
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard here.

Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
A bizarre date with a hanger for the head?
No. Rachel tied me up with a tuxedo! But not just any tuxedo, Batman's tuxedo!
What?
Quite right! Made specifically for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film where the Batman movie was.
You can not wear it! I'm wearing the famous tuxedo! The James Bond tuxedo!
So?
So, if you wear it, you will make my less special.
Sorry, I do not like the idea of ​​when I say "I do", he's thinking, "Yes, I would do it too!"
Well, then we still have a problem.
Yes!
With what?
Well, we're trying to find someone to celebrate our marriage and they're all boring or annoying or, you know, you can not stop staring at the ladies.
Oo! You should make one of us do it!
Phoebe, we're getting there
No! No! It's ... it's a real thing! Anyone can be ordered on the Internet and perform like weddings and other things!
Are you serious?
Yup! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
I call him!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys, thank you very much, but neither is marrying us.
Calling it no longer means anything ?!
We will have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and master of his saliva!

See, I see .... great passion for your future.
Really?
I want it.
Oh Ross, you're so exceptional. [she playfully scratches her head and gets up]
Never gonna happen.

Everybody knows!
It had to be a good thing, I forgot why.
Listen, Monica, me, you know, okay, you know, I could not sleep for a month, because I got some ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, you, you could have simply knocked over the pillow.
Yes, I would have had if I did not have a big spaghetti on the other side.
What?!?!
Ok, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can shed.
You can pour. In the sink.
Oh, honey, it's not your fault, you know, this is what you are, and I love you, and I want you to be friends, and if I keep living here I do not see that happening.
I love you too.
Aww, good. What?
What? I just said.
No, you're not, you're wondering what pillow it is.

My God! Are you serious?!
Uh Huh.
I'd like to live with you Ross; is fantastic! Thank you!
Well, I'm just glad I can help you, you know, to help you.
Wow! I'm so happy for you guys. This is so, not stupid.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what it means to me!
I mean, I wanted to be homeless.
You just saved me!
You are my hero!
Hero, I do not know ... well, all right.
Oh, I have to go and tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please! Now you will say things, right?
No.
No I will not do it.
But I should tell you, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and said he did not love her, but he did it, and he just blew himself up!
And that's how he ended up living with me!
Ok, this is a lie.

Ugh !!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross's house.
Oh, I missed the count or something.
Damn!
She is no longer there.
Oh, I - I watch, Ross is doing her piece of "Watching TV".
No Joey, I think he's just watching TV.

... Damn, take the girl! Ok, are they all ready?
Uh, listen, I just want to thank you for this great opportunity.
You lose the tunic.
Myself?
Is fantastic.
Well, I'll take another espresso. Can I get you another milk?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's all?
Yes, it was really difficult.
Oh yes, that embrace seemed rather brutal.
Ok, you were not there.

Wow! It's ah, it's cute!
Very nice?
You'll have to forgive my roommate, he wanted to marry him.
We do not have 50 dollars, but would you be willing to negotiate for this? We have a canoe.
You know, I really do not think we need a canoe.
You must take a canoe!
All right, just take the entertainment center and then when you get home, throw away the canoe!
We do not throw it away! I built that canoe!
Good for you!!

Phoebe?
Yes?
All right. So I guess it's just, wait here then. Hello. I need a fake ticket in Yemen.
A ticket for Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just need a ticket for the fake.
I'm sorry, sir, I do not understand.
What would you give to a child if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Are you traveling with a child?
No.
All right, you know what, he'll think I'm giving you a credit card, but what I really do is give you a library card.
Ah, sir, a ticket to Yemen costs $ 2,100 and we do not take the library cards.
What's up? Something wrong? Do you have to stay?

Ok, but this is the last time.
With a chick here, and a chick there.
Here a girl, a girl, a chick everywhere - chickeeeen.
Hey.
Hey.
How are you?
She?
Well, yes, do not ... do not you think it's her?
I do not know. I can not say, but never came back too soon.
Well, anyway, I have to go change, I'm ah, I meet some of the cast for drinks.
I'm sorry?
What?
Ok, fine, so here you go. Go with Vince.
Yes, but Jason is very sensitive.
Well sensitive is important, choose him.
Yes.
Oh sure, go with the girl.
Jason is not a girl!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.

Hello.
So, apparently people are familiar with the history of Europe?
Yes.
Listen to it, the whole, which has come to those who really do not care.
I mean, I think it would have happened either way.
I mean if I had not started it-I-I know I would have.
It was a fantastic night.
Was. It was a fantastic night.
Do you think it was fantastic?
Do we still have a name?
No not yet.
All right, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Hello Baby.

Ah-ah, nowhere to run!
I do not like sitting here! I'm about to finish
No Rachel! They arrived here first!
Why is Ross doing it?
DANGER
My God! Because he's jumping on those women!
No, it's okay. Do not worry about this
Oh, look! It will leave a stain!
Rachel! Hey! All right! You're from Joey!
Really?
Yes! Look!
I've never lived like this before.
I know.
All right, do not waste it, I mean its still food.

Hi Joey, is this the bed Olivia has lost her virginity?
I do not know, but one of the extras certainly did! Hey, listen to Rach. Thanks again for coming to see my scenes!
Oh, please, honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I am ... OH MY GOD! Is it Christian Sanders?
Even so
Oh, in my head he did some nice "non-gay" stuff!
Well, at Christmas he and Santa have done things that are definitely gay!
OK, you have to promise that you will never tell Ross what I told you.
About what?
He's organizing your birthday party.
My God! I love!
You'd better behave surprised.
About what?
My surprise party!
What a surprise party?
Oh finish it. Joey already told me.
Well, he did not tell me.
Hey, do not look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical I'm always the last to know everything.
No you are not. We tell you stuff.
Yuh-huh!
I was the last to know when Chandler was bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
I was the last to know when you had a crush on Joey when he moved.
It seems to be the penultimate.

Chandler, we have not yet got an RSVP from your father.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe because I did not send him an invitation.
Chandler! He is your father; it should be at the wedding.
I do not even know the man. All right? We are not so close. I have not seen it for years.
Well, what will you do when you find out that you have not even been asked ?!
Well, you do not have to know!
It is not that we run in the same environments.
I'm going with you guys, and he's the star of a drag show in Las Vegas.
Ooh, I think I want to exchange circles.
Trust me, you do not want it there either.
All right?
Nobody will be staring at the bride when the groom's father wears a strapless dress.
So! I do not care as long as you do not wear a white dress and a veil.
Ok, I think I need to do some shopping.

Hello! Who's inside?
How are you'?
Who the hell are you?
I guess you would not believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, eh?
No-no, Rachel, I do not understand! He can not see us!
No Yes! The groom can not see the bride!
I will not marry Chandler!
Not after this!
Ok, guys, relax. I doooo.
I have to go.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yes, well, you should do it.

Sorry, I'm late, but I left late.
All right.
So Phoebe, what is the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well, yes, but then I remembered I started it and there was this rally and I was, I was at the top of the pyramid but anyway ... um, what is this book about?
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
You know what, actually Ok, okay, what's so funny here?
I thought you did not smoke.
Oh, I thought you meant marijuana cigarettes, you know?
You know what I mean, like the dubbies?
And actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
But no, I actually smoke all the normal ones, all the time.
We stand up.
Oh me too.
I'm kidding.
Oh me too.

Oh, are you sure you're okay?
Yes.
Still it hurts?
Yes.
What a nice idea. All your clothes match. I will do it.
Hello.
Hey how you doing?
Excellent.
We shared that couple and we kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine anyway.
You know what? You are right. I
Good for you Phoebe!
Ok.
Okay, if you have microphones too, I did not mean it

This sucks! I did not know I had to stay up all night before going to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
It's 6:00 am.
Yes good
Hello!
Hey, I heard you and Joshua are going out for dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think it is, I think it's really strong.
Yes, Rachel, I think you're handling it really well.
It run?
What do you mean to manage it?
There is nothing to manage.
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it were not for me and Joshua.
You know, they will not marry anyway!
What?
Come on!
They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous!
I mean, will they be engaged for what?
One year?
And somewhere along the way, one of them will realize what they have done and will call it all.
I'm telling you that you'll dance at my wedding before you dance.
What the hell is this ?!
What, did you really think it would make me feel better to give me things that I can not use for another two months?
This sucks!
All right, what's my next gift?
!

All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
I have boxes.
Hey guys! Watch this! Check this baby, dig it!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole !!
Ow !! Ow !!!
What?! What?!! What is that?!
I'm drinking?
Oh, I must have said that after you left.
Said what? Exactly.
Whether you like the occasional binge of drinks.
My God!! Ohh, that's it! I'm leaving! You're just a horrible person!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait !!
If you become sensitive about it!
I do not want to lose you.
What happens if I create a position for you?
I will make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.
You can have your office and an increase! Effective tomorrow.
I need an expense account.
Done!
And an assistant.
Sophie, come in here!

Monica? You will be very proud of me. I just made an appointment with two incredibly cute nurses.
Oh my!
I am a male nurse.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I do not think so
What?
What are you talking about?!
You, you're the one telling me to get past Ross and move on.
I'm moving forward and you go forward with me.
Come on, give me a good reason why you do not want to go.
Umm, why do not you?
What?
More difficult than it seems. It's not true?
Okay, come with me, and I've also told them that if we're still here when they come down, we'll go to the cafeteria and see
Yup! There is always space for
Joey, how are you?
Oh, it's easy. Yes, I - I can do it with anything. Watch grandma's chicken salad

Hi, this is Monica ...
Yes???
Oh...
Ok, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right at the bottom.
Thank you.

All right. Let's bring it inside
Wait no, honey, honey, give it to me, throw it to me.
Here it is.
He almost hit me in the face.
A stripper at a bachelor party, is so cliche. Why do not you take a magician ?!
Well, if the wizard can open my beer with his cheeks, then fine.

Hey!
Hey!
You know, I'm really glad I decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy, me too!
You know, I was thinking if we had a big fight and we broke up for a few hours
Yes?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, overbearing and overbearing ?!
The marriage is off, sloppy and immature!
It's me! Come on!
All right. But wait, we can not. My cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we should have lunch.
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Stride ?! The wedding is back!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hello! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you.
So, are you ready to go?
Yes.
Chandler!
I'll be fine with you.

Th-th-this is all that is, a third nipple.
You know?
Only the third nipple run-of-the-mill.
You know?
You can take it off.
Just cut that baby right away!
Take off your shirt and see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
I'm just showing you my third nipple run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off.
Well, this is not a third nipple.
No?
First of all, it's in your ass.
Well, then what is it ?!
Wait a minute, keep it. Johnson! Will you come here a moment?
I'm with Hamilton!
He's good at things on the back, he's wearing it too.

Umm, this is a great wine.
It comes from France in Western Europe of Europe. You know, a few years ago I was really backpacking all over Western Europe.
Really?
Uh-hmm-Wait! Improve Uhm, yes, I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
Anyway, um, I was um, I was hiking
I love hiking!
Oh that's great! I was walking along the slopes of Mount Tibidaybo
I see!
So? Congratulations, you two, I did not even know you were married.
Oh, we ... we did not.
No, no. We
What?!
Um, we're ... we're just doing this kid together, but that's all.
Why?!!
Uh well, we're not alone in that place, you know? But we are very enthusiastic about this.
Oh. Well, then you shush me.
Just tell me how
Uh-oh, I hear another coming.
Sid, you're a lucky dull bastard.

Forget it, Ross.
Yeah, well, you did not know Chi Chi.
Promise everyone?
Yes! We promise! We will be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can enter, but your little friend with the tip of the filter must stay out!
Hey, Phoebe.
"Dear Madam, Buffay.
Thank you for calling attention to our mistake.
We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
We apologize for the inconvenience and I hope you accept this -
Bye Bye.
Yup?
What are you doing'?
Ooh.

Oh my God, honey, we're so destined to be together. We both have copies of the
Honey, both of you.
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Yes? The problem of work?
Oh, it was perfect! I mean, it really felt like I was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him you had?
Oh it's not important. The point is that, really, I think everything will be fine.

Ok, I have some, do you want to put them in her panties?
No thanks, mom!
Oh, no umm, hi, that ... you have to put it out because I'm pregnant.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Very good, so good.
I really liked it. Very exotic
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua did not call.
I mean, you'd think he'd be worried about me not coming to his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Come on! Look where you are !!
When you get a second, another round of daiquiri.
Remember, virgin for me, please.
Oh! And do not let me go without having the name of that kind of carpet.
Ahh, let's go! You know what, you know what, I think I'll come home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help you.
No!
It was a test!
In a couple of hours I'll be really drunk and I want to call Kathy and you guys will have to stop me!
And then later, I'll be so drunk, I want to call Janice
You should! Like her?
Ohhh !!
I think someone needs another lap dance.

All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
You do?
You do not do it? Well, this is the difference between a professional and a lay person.
That and arrogance.
Hey.
Hey! How was the navigation?
Wow thanks!
Joe?
Yes!
You had a lot of sex, right?
When? Today? Some, not much.
Well, that's just why I'm asking, because in a sense, eh, I was not able to ... I mean I really wanted, but I could not.
There, huh-hmm, there was an accident.
Do not worry about that man, it happens.
Did it happen to you?
Yes! One time.
Well, what did you do?
I did the same.

'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Take what you want, just please do not hurt me.
So you're playing a little
Yes, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 is the most stupid that a person can watch, you're definitely 19 years old.
Come on man, how old are you?
Young! Are you a man-child ok ?! Now go and get changed because everyone is ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
And did they know?
Ok, well, Ross, what is it really about?
Look, this is my house and I want to be able to come and go when I want!
Ok, I'll find another place to do the rest of my dates. I do not know what the big problem is!
The big problem is that I do not want naked and greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to throw myself back with a beer puzzle! Cold beer.

Okay, look, it will not hurt him, will you?
Do you always have to bring it here?
I did not want to leave it alone.
Alright?
We had our first meeting this morning.
I think it has to do with my work until late.
I said some things I did not mean, and he ... threw some feces ...
You know, if you'll work late, I could take a look at you for you.
Oh, it would be great!
Ok, but if you do, make sure you're there to see it, okay, and you're not like it for me.
Ok, but if you ask me, I'm not going to lie.

All right, take a look.
Check it.
Here it says that there is a place where you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
"It's almost as good as being there."
It's better! You can not go to a museum in your underwear!
Oh-oh! I bet the English version is gooooood!

Uh, can I help you?
Yes, I spoke to you on the phone, I'm the lady who got stuck with the racing bed.
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed up for this, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester, look, we want to see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Hey! You can not go back there!
My God.

So, this must be nice enough for you, eh?
I mean, your father tells me you have a couple of days at school, and you, you, do not have to sell those cookies anymore.
Well, I wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp and sits in a
Wow, you ah, you really like all this stuff, huh?
Yes.
My father says that if I spend so much time helping him clean apartments, while daydreaming outside space, he could afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think you should clean a lot of apartments to go to India.
No. The one from Atlantic City, dad, loves slots. He says he will double the college money my grandmother left me.
Oh, um, I do not know if it's a good idea.
Oh. Look, just friends, I will not afflict you. I promise.
No, I just think it's too early.
No, it's not too early, I had lunch at eleven.

I invented the game of Cups as a way to give money to Joey.
And now you want that money back.
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me?
It is not a real game! I invented it!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
I do not know.
But I can see through your sheet.
Yes, yes, it's her.
But you know what?
It does not matter, I will never be able to meet her anyway.
Why?
Because it is impossible to find his apartment! He lives in a parallel universe similar to a sexy girl, or something like that.
What are you talking about? Obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. He lives on
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby.
And you know the other over there, that's the ladder.
You were wrong.
I did it

Monica, I bet the apartment, I do not know.
Rachel, I have not lost a question for the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Do you have the answers written there?
No! Stable like a rock! Now, you're with me.
All right, let's do it.
Come on!
All right.
All right, gentlemen, you're the first.
All right.
All right.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning starts - stop it - now. What was Monica's nickname when he was a field hockey goalie?
Great fat goalkeeper.
Correct. It supports Rachel
dangerous relationships
Correct. His favorite movie is ...
Weekend at Bernie's
Well, look, because not really, because you're not part of our phase two strip club with us.
Yes, come on, we can be boys!
No you can not.
Come on! We try to be guys! Maybe we want to be boys!
You do not want to be boys, you'd be all hairy and I will not live longer.
You know, you just stopped being so good and you let it go and you come with us to watch the naked girls dancing around !!
All right.
I'm sorry.

And you know what, I just realized, in the last year I only came out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
You have to help me here, you have to settle down, you have to get back into the game.
Well, that should not be a problem. I mean, I work in fashion and all those I meet are suitable heterosexual men.
Pete, can I bring you something else?
Yes, a slice of cheesecake and ... and a date if you gave them away.
Did not we discuss this topic with you and you?
Hmm, come on, you just told her that you.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blonde wig and big tits and the fact that I need you to eat.
Well, if it's true, I'll go out with my aunt Ruth.
And the two times we left were simply embarrassing.
Come on, you think he should go out with me, right?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
I mean it's not a nice picture in the morning, you know what I mean.
That wig all in disarray, and the tits thrown on the bedside table, you know.
I mean, really, think about it.
Ho-ho, I will do it.

I think I read it somewhere!
This is not fun, it's physically impossible!
Ok?
Depending on the species I should have a length of six feet ...
It's not funny!
!
I respectfully disagree.
I can not believe you put it on my student page!
Who cares? Nobody reads these things
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
I do not have a page.
Oh oh oh! I REPLY IN AVAILABLE MODE !!

I know you miss me too. I can not wait to see you. I love you. Hello.
Ok, what's here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I really miss this apartment. You know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right there.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I came across this and it kind of kicked me out a bit?
I love this place! To tell you the truth, I would not have to move.
Uhh, are you saying you're not completely happy with this?
Well, I mean if, if Emily gave me a choice
you
Why?
Hey guys! See what I found in the giiiiiiift store. Get up! Get up! Get up!

I let a bra dry on the shower, do not you think your child will think it's yours and be horribly traumatized?
Hey, if mom can have a wife, dad can have a bra.
Oh, it's time to go.
Oh, no-no-no, you see, that-that clock is a bit quick, uh, we have 17 minutes.
Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
Twice?
Well, it's ambitious.
Hey, you can ignore it.
It's Carol with your son!
The morning is here! The sun is here! The sky is clear, the morning is here! The morning is here!
HEY !! do
Oh come on! The morning is here! The morning is here! The morning is here! The sun is here!
I
Are you kidding? I love that guy! The morning is here! The morning is here-
Stop that! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Do what I did.
Monica, you do not even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
You know what? I'm
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
All right.
See, this is a
Shut up! This place is a hole!

Well, buddy, it's time to roll.
Ninth!
No, no-n-n-n-no !!
You're going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic and a pajama store!

Are you under the sheet?
Yup.
Great, let's start. How's the pressure?
Beautiful! Wow Phoebe you're good!
Declaring the obvious, but thanks. And it's not strange it is.
No. Ooohh
It's right, you enjoy yourself.
Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
All right.
Oh God Phoebe !! Oh that's all! That's all! Right here! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh

Hello!
Oh, Alice, bye!
Thank you.
I'm so happy you can come, because I have a real domestic emergency.
Oh my God, who died on this ?!
Yes I know. It is a real mustard-tastrofo. You can help me?
Become a theater critic!
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
By the way, he downloaded me tonight after reading my review.
Oh, elegant.
Yup! Surely I know how to choose them, eh? You know, I gave up a part for a soap for this!
Wow! Yes, ah, I gave up a job too.
Really. What?
Uh, de-clawed cats.
Hey, tell me what.
Let me take you home.
We will stop at all newsstands and we will burn every copy of their Times and Post.
Why the Post?
Oh, did not you see the Post?
Not you?
No because?

Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Uhh, well, I have an audition down the street and I poured sauce everywhere on my shirt. Do you have one more?
Yes sure. Umm here.
Great. You have something that is not
Yes, I do not think about Joe.
All right, I guess everything will be fine.
Hey, listen, what are you doing tonight?
Nothing Why?
How would you feel to remove my Tag assistant? I'll pay.
Huh, Rach, I have to say they'll make a lot of money to go out with a guy.
I'm not asking you to go on one
Really? Because I could use the money.
Joey, just ... he's new to town and I know he has no friends.
Just bring it to a ball game or something.
I really appreciate it.
Yes, OK.
Yes?
Sure no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Yes!
All right.

Smell of problem in the litter? Do not change your kitten, change your cat's waste.
Sorry, Phoebe.
Yes. Are you okay?
No! Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Hello!
Hello. Well, look, I was going to leave a message, is not it tonight, your anniversary dinner?
Yes. Well, umm .....
Rachel, are you okay?
Yes I'm fine.
Do you want to talk, I mean I can come?
No! Really, no, please, please, everything is ok.
All right, all right, I'm coming and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Oh yes, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
And for me.
Oh. OK Bye.

Come on, take it, get it!
Hello?
Transit authority?
Yes, bye.
I'm researching a book and wondering what anyone could do if they left a child on a city bus.
Yes, I realize that it would be a very stupid character.
Hi, here's the deal.
Today we lost a seat on a bus.
It is made of white plastic, with a handle and fits into a stroller.
Oh, and there was a baby inside.
He wants to talk to you again.

Hello.
I'm sorry, I'm a little late.
Ah - Whoa!
Very late.
Let me begin uh, introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.
So, to sum up, I'm Professor Geller.
Good work today

Good evening ladies.
My name is Ross Geller.
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.
And I - I realize that the competition is fierce but - I'm sorry.
I can not help but notice that you are naked and I applaud you.
Friend, I would like to be naked.
I mean, this ... looks so beautiful.
Here's how God meant it.

Ok, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during all our friendship!
But when we were in high school I made friends with James Farrell even when I knew you liked it!
Wow, I feel so good to take off my chest!
OK Go!
My turn? What are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
What?!
I heard someone on the phone the other day and you said, "I'll tell Rachel that I've been doing laundry for a couple of hours."
And he said, "Laundry?
IS
Well. It looks like you're writing a little music, Rach. Wow! Let me know how it turns out.
Well, I do not know why I got so out of my mind that I hung up the phone.
Well, if you kept listening, you'd have heard it called Mr. Big ot.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He says more
All right. So you're telling me there's nothing between you and Chandler.
Chandler and me?

I really thought you were making a good point. I mean, you know, until you've cut yourself out.
Yes, what's up with that girl, Monica?
I do not know! I did not come with her!
All right! All guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
A test?!!
Come on! The tests make us all better students! Oh yeah! We should have questions about the essay !!

Ok, I have one for you, if you also had what you'd rather eat, a dog to see or a talking gorilla?
I should say the talking gorilla, because at least I can tell him that you're making me eat from him.
Someone went to college. Wow. What is that? I'm sorry.
Ok, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay still.
I think it's better, sir.
But we really need to find someone here.
Work is beginning to accumulate.
I have a stack of documents on my desk so high.
You know what you should do, throw them into the shedder and claim you never saw them.
That's a good one.
What a boy must do

Yes, yes, they are all here. Hey, everyone, say hello to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi, Julie!
There is no national football league.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sunday and Monday nights.
Oh, shoot! I work Monday evening.
Umm, this stuffing is incredible. Do you think we should bring some?
When they are hungry enough, they will enter.

Hey, Joey, did you want to talk to me?
I do not know. You have something for me?
Oh yes, this is from Rachel.
Ten. All right. Now Tag is something like too many women.
Really?
Yes for you!

Oh, Danielle! I did not expect the car ... Call me when you get a chance. Bye Bye. Oh God!
That is
Hey, I'm perfecting!
What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh ..
I want you to think I could be in a restaurant ... you know?
I could have some kind of life, as if I had not sat here to refine the last few hours.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
My God! Go away! Stop looking here!
Fantastic, now he's coming back.
Friend, we have to do something for that boy.
This morning, I surprised him while he was looking in our apartment.
It creeps me out!
I feel like I can not do things!
What kind of stuff?
You grow up? I'm not talking about sexy things, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Do you cook naked?
Yes, toast, oatmeal ... nothing but splashes.
What are you watching me for? I did not know.

You know, they say that a dish seen never emits beeps.
It's only a couple of hours, and she did not call. Not that I'm even interested, you know.
Phoebe, why do not you call her? Obviously you want it.
You think you know me so well.
Well, I do not want Cha?
Yes.
Ok, well, I know you.
That's what I said.
Well?
I can not
I can not
He downloaded me, I mean, I totally trusted her and then one day it was "Okay, bye Pheebs".
You know what's the saddest part, when we were playing together, it was the funniest I've ever had in all my life.

OK Bye. Well, Monica will not come, it's just me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, wait for the camper, are you sure you thought about this?
It's a laundry. The way of thinking is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on an appointment.
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
So what are you saying here? Should I shave again, get some wine, what?
Well, you might want to rethink the dirty laundry.
This is basically the first time you'll see your underwear, do you want it to be dirty?
No.
Oh, um, the softener?
Ok, ok, now what's wrong with mine
Here it is.

Ok, so it's just because it was my table, do I have to buy a new one?
This is the rule.
Which rule? There is no rule, if nothing else, you owe me a table!
How did you get there?
Well, I think the furniture went well up to your little breakfast with Angela Delvecchio
Did you know that?
Well, let's say that the impressions you've made in butter have left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, and if we split it?
What do you mean, buy it together?
Yes
Do you think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
Well, it's a rather big effort, I mean, and if one of us wants to move?
Why, are you transferring?
I will not move.
You would tell me if you were going to the right
Yes, yes, it's just the one with my last Kip roommate ...
Aw, I know everything about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran away and got married, and things went very badly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a roommate better than me?
Aw, do not do it

Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have an appointment for a massage.
Oh no, stay here we will continue to do it. I will pay you
No, I got in trouble for the first one. See you later.
Absolutely. I love your way of kissing.
My God! My God! I'm so sorry!
I forget, it's from
Do you think you can tear my daughter apart and then do not marry her ?! I will kill you!!
You know, it's really not a great time for me.

All right! So we will simply be married.
Yes exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Wow! This is so surprising. I really thought I had to involve you more in this.
Ok, see, now I'm scared because I do not really think you're joking.
I'm not joking. Look, I - I can not have
What ... what will we stay married forever?
Ok, look, how will it affect you?
Really?
I mean that you fill out some form once in a while and instead of checking the box that says you're checking the box that says Mrs.!
His
Oh, ok, I'm sorry.
You are right.
You know what?
We can absolutely stay married, because I had the impression that the boxes were far away
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!
And like my wife, I think you should give me this favor.

My God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
I think I should have known when he started going to the dentist four and five times a week.
I mean, how can your teeth be cleaned?
My brother is going through it right now, it's such a mess. How did you overcome it?
Well, you could try to accidentally break something precious, let's say she-
-leg?
This is a way! Me, I- I went to watch.
Did you really break his watch?
Ooh, stay away from you.
Quite right.
Barry, I'm sorry ...
I'm so sorry...
I know you probably think this is all I said the other day about you making love with your socks, but it's not ... it's not, it's about me, and me, hi, car-cutting me away again ... anyway ...

No, true, honey, it's okay, just go with Susan.
Really, I, no, I think the girls that come out is a great idea.
Ok, ok, bye
So what are they doing?
I do not know, something feminine.
Hey, you're early.
What are you doing with the lamp?
I'm just recovering it.
Oh, well, do not take it to the same place you got the stereo, because they've had that thing for over a week.
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one makes noise here.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
You do not play the oboe!
I could play the oboe!
Ohhh! It's so sweet!
Okay, okay, I know I'm a Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's so hard, I mean to see you go around and I just want to touch you and hold you back, come on nobody around, just kiss me.
All right, that's it! Come down to her!
What is going on?
What is going on?! Here's what's happening !!
Ross!
I've been in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
What should I do to get a service?
Hi Rachele.

Ross?
Yes?
Hey, it's Mona! From the wedding
Oh hello!
Hello!
Wow! How are you?
I'm fine except, you still owe me a dance.
Oh this is true. Well, would you like to see a Ukrainian film?
Oh you are serious. Sure!
Great! Good, umm
I think I might need another cup of coffee.
Sure! Uh, let me take it for you.
All right.

Look, I feel really bad about how I scared you before, so I called my father and asked him to meet you here to say so.
Leave!
What? Hey, wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you know who the father is?
Sometimes I play crazy, but I'm a little more than a pretty blonde girl with an ass that will not stop.
I believe this belongs to your child's father.
Oh God Oh, is he in there right now?
Uh Huh. Now you can turn around or you can enter and tear the Band-Aid. What do you want to do?
Uh, let's tear!
Really? Are you sure?
Oh Phoebe!
Ok, sorry. Yes.
Hey, Rachel.

Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Oh, you're so wonderful.
Why do not you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
I can not believe you guys bought it, enjoy your slow death.
I think there are people who have sex.
It can not be me, I'm right here.
Do you want to peek?
No!
Come on!
You know what? I do not like you, without mom. Come on.
Are not we peeking?
Well, I'm peeking. My God!
Hi sir, you know Monica.

Chandler is fantastic !!
What?!
Oh God, we just clicked!
Do you know how people can click?
As if he had come to get me, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click!
Did he tell you?
Oh, I ...
Oh, and he has such a good heart! Does not have a good heart?
Oh I know ...
Oh, I know and it's so sweet! Listen, he said he would call, then let it go.
Is not it fantastic ?!
Do not ruin it.

Hello.
Hi sweetie!
Hello.
Hi, Ross.
Yes, eh.
I have bad news.
What?
I can have a quick bite, but then I have to come back here.
Come on baby! You've had to work late every night for the last two weeks, what's this time?
In fact, it's my fault. I-I go out today.
But work comes first of all! Oh, hey, but this is sad for you, though, what happened? Burnt? It burns everything, does not it?
Nooo, he's going for a better job.
Oh well, it's great, so I guess this is ah, this is goodbye then. Eh? Goodbye.
OK then.
All right.
Well, we'll miss you around here.
Yes me too.
So, I'll see you on Saturday.
Yes, you can bet on it.

Whazzup ??
Seriously a friend, 3 years ago.
Listen, can you do me a favor?
Today I'll be out.
Can you keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Do not you trust him?

I think the check-in is like this.
Ahh.
Monica confronts her, Chandler is against marriage. And it will always be!
Well, there are some people who want to marry me.
There are?
Yes! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you ?! And ... and Chandler is telling you how much he hates marriage ?!
Quite right.
grocer
You just told me he hates marriage!
That ... that's a ... a complex guy who will hardly take a wife!
That - which is against marriage and always will be!
You have

You know you probably did not know, but back in high school, I had a big crush on you.
I knew it.
You did it! Oh ... I always thought you just thought I was Monica's brilliant older brother.
I did it.
Oh.
Listen, you think ... and try not to let my intense vulnerability become some kind of factor here, but do you think it would be ok if I asked you out?
Sometimes?
Could be?
Yes, maybe...
Ok ... okay, maybe I will ...

Why?
Well, I thought it would make me feel good doing something nice for my friend.
Well, you're incredible.
Oh no-no-no.
A TV as if it appeared from nowhere! This is the dream! Friend, how could you afford this stuff?
Well, you know, I'm 29 years old. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you're the best friend anyone has ever had.
Oh I do not know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are!
You do this, you give me the good advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on a woman, I'll do it.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I'll see how things go with Kathy. She's very pretty.
O Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
It could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
You know what I think?
I think someone has a crush on Casey.
How can I fix you?
What do you think?
That all the pieces of my life are falling into place!

Hey, did someone take a piece of rope about six feet long with a little fuck at the end?
Honey, what's the problem?
I just saw Janice.
Because every time I see your face, I can not help but fall from grace. I know.....
Wow! This girl is good
Oh-yes, yes! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of it before.
I like her.
Why? Why can she sing and play guitar and do both at once?
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for these people.
Look at yourself. All jealous.
Yes, Phoebe, come on, you two have completely different styles. You know, she's more ... you know, and you're more
next to meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Ok, see, see, everyone else is happy that she's finished.
Ok, my next song is called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say.
I really loved when we were singing partners, and I should not have left you like that.
Oh no, one of those "look for the hidden meaning" of the songs.

Yes, bye.
I have a question.
Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Thank you.
No,
What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
Okay, look ... look, let's go downstairs, we'll have a little fun and you'll forget about everything.
Ross, no! There is
Oh come on! Rach, it's not that bad.
Ross, I'm a human doodle !!
Look, just because an idiot has drawn you on your face does not mean you should not have fun!
All right?
And then, hey-hey-hey, nobody will
Ok, there was

Come on!
Oh wait, do not you have to pay for yours, ladies prospering?
No, it's okay. A few guys asked me to take it for him, but I did not
Oh yeah? All right.
All right.
But! Do not you have to return your money?
Uh Huh. Hey, here you go friend. Sorry, no porn for you. Ok, let's go see Monica!

My God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, do you want to come for a lemonade?
So?!
Whoa, ah !! Will you give us some lemonade?
Yes huh !! Cover yourself!
Oh, right.
I do not believe it! When someone asks you for lemonade and does it mean that they want to have sex?
Well usually ... yes!
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, just, I thought you liked me.
I'm such an idiot.
All right. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not someone I know, but ... By the way, I can still see it.

Hmmm ... this is so beautiful.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question like ... more than a general wonder ... ment.
OK.
OK. Here it is. For a while now, I wanted, um ....
Ohhh !!!!
Yes it's true ...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ouch!
Well, I probably would have done it at some point.
I did not mean
Why not?
It's brilliant!
Hi Mike, see you at the wedding, buddy!
Well, we probably will not invite you to the wedding ...
Thanks, Chandler.
Sincerely.
Well, you're welcome! I'm glad to help you.
How do you think I should propose?
David, I'm pretending to do it

Ok, you still have 19 questions to ask. Use them wisely. Come on, Joey! You can not win if you do not ask
What?!
Well, you promised me a fun trip!
We've been on the road for six hours and you've slept for half past five!
We are moving to the next rest stop and
All right. All right.
Yes! And until then you'll sing me because the radio is broken and you're selfish but you have a good voice.
Really? I do not
To sing!!
Friend, this is a long journey! Are my eyes open? No!
Morning!

Everything was delicious!
Thank you!
Was. The duck in particular was superb.
Thank you! You did not say anything ...
In fact I have a small complaint.
Oh ... please! I-I welcome criticism.
The musician right outside the restaurant ... he's kind of a killer of mood!
Which musician?

Did we do it?
You owe me $ 20.
Thank you. Thanks a lot!
Chandler, here you go, you have your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese dishes and your Funyun family bag.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you have for Thanksgiving dinner?
What, what, what is with you and this holiday?
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
We've just finished this wonderful Thanksgiving dinner.
I - and I vividly remember this part - a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is when my parents choose to tell me they are about to get divorced.
My God.
Yes. It is very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner after seeing it otherwise.

Hey, who is this little boy naked?
That little naked boy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yes, yes, well, this is my penis. Can we be adults now?
Who are those people?
You got me
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Joe and Joe's band'.
Wow, Monica, you look like your grandmother. How old was she?
Let's see, 1939 ... yes, 24, 25?
It looks like a funny gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I took Monica naked!
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, I'm just trying something.

So, what is it?
Rachel has something she wants to tell you and me, I think this is your red sweater.
No. This is my red sweater.
Oh no, could I have someone with a coffee or a poison? No? Just for me? All right.
What's happening, Rach?
Anything! Phoebe made a mistake. But you know you wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of challenge?
You know, I'm really happy that Phoebe called.
I know we broke up because you thought I was not mature enough, but I really grew up and I think we should get back together.
Oh, it's not the right time.
It's the right time
All right.
'Kay!

I can handle the stick !!

Odd thing I heard - Mother of God is true!
Chandler Bing!
Jan-Janice!
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contract and everything.
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide basin. You remember Chandler.
Janice, I did not even know you were pregnant! Who is the unaware human who is the essence that you stole?
It is you. This is yours.
What?!
See how nervous he feels! We have not slept together for years!
It is funny. It hurts? Does the job hurt?

Friend, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking about dinner ?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
You know, you know I'm watching and I do not think anyone is home here.
I say just break the window, crawl, and - and I can explain later.
Yes? Really? Nobody is home?
I do not think so Hello? When you arrive there

Hi how are you?
I just saw Danny go on the subway with a girl and he held her arm.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, it's all your fault! You have meddled in our relationship !!
You have not had any relationships !!
No, but I was doing my things and everything was going according to plan!
Oh God, stop with the plan!
So what, so what did you see with a girl?
Who cares?!
This does not mean anything!
Now look, you'll go out for an appointment with Danny and you'll be so charming that he'll forget all about that stupid subway girl.
It was rather stupid.
You are right.
All right, I'll go to the appointment.
I'm going to the appointment.
This is the new plan.
Come, hurry up!

Hello.
Phoebe!
Ta-da.
Hey.
Hello.
Ahh, look at you, you're beautiful.
I? Thanks you too.
Thank you.
Sparkling.
So, wow, this is really wonderful, eh.
Mr. Major capade guy.
I remember when you were alone, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
You always said I could make it.
Yeah, well, you know, I'm a little spooky this way. Wooo.
I missed you. I will be changed.
OK.
Um, now. Phoebe.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
What?
Er, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.

Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers, I can not wait for your party to come tonight.
Listen, I forgot your address, can you call me?
Thanks bye.
Hey!
Hey!
What is going on'?
Yes, it's a pity that you can not get to that show for a woman tonight.
Oh, I'd like to, but I have to get up early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
Oh yes, yes, yes ...
"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers who can not wait for your party tonight"
Stupid Jane Rogers !!
Are you celebrating tonight ??
I have a ... something for the days of the people in our lives.
And you were not going to tell us? How did you think to get away with it?
I do it every year
Do you do it every year ??
I did not have to tell you !! I'm more stupid than Jane Rogers !!
Oh, that's why you got these tickets for that performance, to get rid of us?
Yes...
And last year is why you sent us to that medieval restaurant?
Yes...
OH! And the year before, when did you set that night tour of that button factory?

Who is this from?
Oh, that's Ross.
Oh ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Remember what?
It was like months ago.
We were walking in this antique shop, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like my grandmother when I was a child.
Oh!
I can not believe he remembered!
Oh, it's so cute. This must cost him a fortune.
I can not believe he did it.
Come on, Ross? Do you remember when I went to college when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
F-hah .... flennin ....
My God.

I really like waking up with you.
I like to wake up with you too. Oh! It's a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
It would be great!
We could have breakfast in bed
Wait, just a second.
All right. Oh! Oh no

Well, it was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Hello!
Is this Bonnie? Is this Bonnie? Are you Bonnie?
Can I show you a document if you wish?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you're very different from the last time I saw you.
Oh yes, I just started wearing the bras again.
Oh, it must be like that.
Well, I hope you enjoy tonight.
Thank you! You too.
I believe it.
No, you do not.
Sure.
No, you know, you know, you will not let me suck on this.
Oh sure I am, because you must always be right.
I do not always have to be-okay, okay
Jurassic Park

I'm telling you, something is wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the garbage chute.
Ross could not adapt to the garbage chute.
Exactly, he could almost. It's exactly like I stuck there.
Hey!
There he is!
My God! Where the hell have you been? !!
Alone, you know.
Oh, out, oh God, I do not know why we did not think to check there!
What were you doing?
I went to a bar. And then I just, uh, I walked for a while.
Have you walked all night in the city alone?
He connected! He connected with someone.
Look, I do not have to answer your questions! All right? I'm a big boy, I can do anything I want!
He hooked !! Tell us about her!
Ross, you left your scarf in Hey you guys.

All right.
Oh yes, it looks good.
Guys, do a
Yes, we're fine together.
Yes, we
All right.
Wow! Imagine what our children would be like!
You know, we do not have to imagine it.
The groom.
We'll see.

Hey! Hey! Pay attention to my Porsche!
Hi Joey.
Hey! How are you'?
It has the most incredible Porsche down there!
I'd like to show you, but I just put it inside.
She is sleeping.
Hey, would you like two girls to have a drink?

Well, the old lady is dead.
And how do I know?
His dying wish was for one last kiss.
But I do not care, because you have the apartment.
Yup!
Ewww. Yes. Umm. I think I'll stay here.
Is not it fantastic?
Ezels !!

Smelly cat, stinky cat, what do they feed you? Smelly cat, stinking cat, it's not your fault.
Wow is fantastic.
Oh yeah!
You know, you could absolutely sell it. It would be perfect for how umm, a cat litter campaign.
I ..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
What? Why not? You could make a lot of money.
Okay, well, if I were in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire now, you know.
You just have to get out of that sweet jewel.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
All right. All right, I'll play a song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.

Ok sir, um-mm, let's see if I understand correctly.
Ah, so this is a half-caf, double high, nutty easy, not fat, no foam, with whisk, extra hot milk, right?
Ok, fantastic.
You're a maniac.
Thank you.
Um, coffee, please.
Isabella Rosselini.
Are you serious? My God.
Damn! I can not believe I took it off my list.
Why? Why else would you do it?
Yes, maybe.
Oh-oh, minds.
What do not you think I could go to her?
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit that you liked me.
Yes, well, miss, you'd better be happy that the list is laminated.
You know what honey, go ahead, we'll call it an alternative.
Ok, keep my crawler.
All right.
Rachel, will you really let him do this?
Honey, Isabella Rosselini is about to hit. I'm just sorry we do not have popcorn.
Ok, this is enough
'....
You will not dance around with me.
A-ha !!!

Oh-oh-oh, yes! That's right, you take care of those kids!
I'm sorry?
It's me, Joey!
I know you?
Joey!
Oh-ho, yes. Yes, the boy's hands.
All right, it's right.
All right.
Good!
Choose one.
Left! Thank you.
You are welcome.
Ross!
Joey! We should only change.
Yes, absolutely!
Yes.

Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Oh alright!
You know, I ended up spending some good times.
You know, the charity organization has been very successful and they have raised a lot of money and awareness.
So, for what reason?
I mean an illness.
Hey!
Hey!
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said he turned on
Huh. All right.
Oh my God, look! This is Elizabeth!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Ah, to be 13 again.
Yes.

Hey! So, was he excited for the tickets?
No! He blew us up!
What?!
I know!
I can not believe. Can I tell you something? I'm a bit angry with him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
You know what? He did not want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we do not talk to him
Ooooh! Freeze it.
Quite right!
I like it!
Handle?
Yes, you grow up a little. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about ... spring break.
Oh good.
Look, I look, I'm having a lot of fun with you and I do not want to move too fast or exercise a lot of pressure.
So, I'm sorry, I do not think we should go away together yet.
It's ... it's too early.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple of weeks.
No. I think you misunderstood what
You are so adorable.
What! Let's talk about.

Hey!
How do you feel?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again between twelve and fourteen hours.
Ok, so me
And protected them from a tornado?
My God.
I know, the children are sleeping.
Phoebe, what, what happened here ?!
I did it! I took care of the children alone!
But my apartment!
It was the setting for Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
It is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the children alone.
You're right, you're right, I should not scare you.
Because this is what will happen when you and I have children!
When will?
!
Phoebe, you'd take a look at this mess !!!!

Hey!
Hey Ross! The child is kicking!
What?! IS?!
He is not going to kick now. Although we would like to see you do it again.
Hey, when ... when was he going to kick? What happened?
Last night! I heard it and went into Joey's room and he was sleeping
A dreamless sleep.

So come on, boys, tell me all the filth!
Well, the biggest news is that you throw Barry at the altar!
Alright. We talk about reality for a second.
All right.
When you come back home?
What? Guys, I'm not.
Come on, this is us.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I have this job
Waitress?
Ok, I'm not just doing the waitress.
I'm..
I, um ...
I write special offers on the table of special offers and, uh ... and I, uh ...
I take the dried flowers from the vase ... Oh, and sometimes, Artelle lets me put the chocolates on the biscuits.

We go down towards midnight, why do not we come to pick you up then?
So, um, will you bring the truck?
I even let you ring the bell.
My God.
See, here it is, the works of purification!
They are good guys.
Oh, they're firemen.

Your son.
No-no-no. I do not have a son named Jordie. We all agree, the name of my son is Jamie.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we came back to Jordie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramps, leg cramps, leg cramps.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it! Hey, you go to sleep with her, I have cramps.
No, you do not.
All right, that's all. I want both.
Why?
He started!
No, you started it.
You did it!
I do not care. I'm trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
But...
Now you go!
Many thanks.
See what you did.
Yes, listen ...
On

Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What I said?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
My God! It's no wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hello.
Um, you could tell me about Sergei that I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
You did not say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering ....
Okay, ah, before you come back again, umm, you could also tell Sergei that I really like her dress.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
So you're a chef?
I'm also thinking about opening my restaurant.
Oh really.
Monica, I can talk to you about my menu, please. What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Yes but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I have not been able to say two words to each other.
What do you want me to do? Are you sitting here in silence while the three of you have a conversation?
It would be great. Thank you.

so finally we get to the top of the mountain and the empty head here forgets the camera!
Oh, you know, the same thing happened to me once.
When did it happen ?!
You do not remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really cute bird and I wanted to take a picture: I did not have my camera!
Oh yeah. First of all, chasing the Churo boy is not jogging.
Oh, it's so nice you have to try it.
Oh damn! I got it on my pants.
Here, I'll take it.
We'd better take off these pants upstairs or that stain will turn.
Yes. I'll wear them for our appointment tonight.
Oh great!
OK Bye! My God!!
It was amazing!
All right, see? I told you!
Yes, wow, sorry Rach.
I do not think they are brother and sister.
I'm brother and sister !!!

Action!
I found the picture!
What image ?!
My wife's photo! In your backpack!
Have you crossed my personal property?
Why do you have a picture of Paulette in your backpack?
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yes?
Oh you're amazing! And, in this last speech? You wet me
Many thanks.
Here is your call sheet for tomorrow.
I know.

So, Chandler, your parents must have been thrilled when you said you were engaged.
Oh yes, I should probably call them.
I remember when we got engaged for the first time.
Oh, I do not think I've ever heard that story.
Oh dad, you really do not need it
Well, I had pregnant Judy. I still do not know how it happened.
You do not know how it happened ?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
Well, at least you do not hear it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
However, we are really excited about our plans for marriage, and I imagine we will soon be making a big retirement from Monica's wedding fund.
What?
Tell him, Jack, I can not do it.
What happened? You still have Monica's wedding fund, are not you?
We have it. Only now, we call it the house by the sea.

After applying the Waxine and the linen strips to the number one leg,
Done!
Grasp one of the strips of linen with its "simple grip" and remove it with a quick movement without pain.
All right. Ow !!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was not it without pain?
No. It was painful. Oh my God, they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, girls in satin nightgowns do not seem to think it's that bad.
This is because their nerves are probably dampened by being so stupid.
But hey, you know if you do not believe me, please, for my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! My God!!!
Now, are you glad you did not start with the bikini stripes?

now remember that you must imagine me in a kilt.
I can picture you in a short tartan skirt and knee socks.
Do you want to start telling secrets?
No!
Now, remember that I am still learning.
One two three four!
Know the song! Sing together!
So?
No!

My God! That's David!
David who?
David, the scientist boy, David I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart, David!
My God!
Oh, you say someone's name pretty well, they turn around.
Phoebe?
David! What-what are you doing here? Should not you be in Russia?
Yes, I'm alone, I'm in town for a conference. Umm,
Good yes. You're fine too. Did you have a haircut?
Yes. Well, I'm thirty.
Yes.
Yup! Santa is coming!

Hey, I'm really sorry for what happened today in the cafeteria.
It is nothing serious. Hey, you know, do what you have to do. Right?
But hey, it's not just me, I mean scientists and tour guides
Everything.
It's like that everywhere, Joey!
Ok, Monday, bring me here.
Where you work, the waiters eat with the waiters, right?
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
I eat alone in the alley because everyone hates me.
Listen, Ross, really, it's not a big deal.
You know you're wearing a white coat, I'm wearing a blue blazer, if that means we can not be friends at work, so be it.
You know, hey, I understand.
You know?
Hey, when I'm in a comedy and you're in the audience, I'm not talking to you, are you?
So, you know, it's fantastic.
See you tomorrow.
Yes, when we are in the audience, he does not speak to us, but he agitates.

You looked like an idiot.
Hey, I was not the only one who looked like an idiot.
All right?
Do you remember when Ross tried to say "Butternut Pumpkin"?
And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yes, it's the same.
That's all. This is my worst Thanksgiving.
Oh wait! That can not be what Rachel talks about. He did not even know it had happened. So what was it?
Which?
Umm, I-I really do not want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving the past pain and feeling depressed is what makes Thanksgiving.
You know, at least for me.
And of course the Indians.
Look, among all the people, you do not want me to tell this story!

Hi guys.
Hello! Phoebe.
Hi Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologize if yesterday I felt a little nervous about my shower. You know, it's just hormones, you know.
No us
Hormones.
hormones, yes
Your parents'?
Yes, I'm out of town.
Ohh.
Yes, yes, this is it
Yes, it works.
They-they-they can smell the fear.

Bing! I have! And the Bing-ette!
Honey, remember my boss Doug, right?
Yes, bye
Hello. So good news, divorce is final. I signed the documents this A.M.
I did not know you and Carol were divorcing, I'm sorry.
Sorry? Finally I chewed my leg from the bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys!
No chewing for us ladies.
Oh well, give it time.
So divorce, marriage, we have a lot to celebrate.
How about going out for dinner tomorrow night?
I can not think of anything about what we're doing. Why can not I think of something we're doing?
Tomorrow evening is then, I should be out of the field at six.
They continue to launch these cases of sexual harassment against me and keep throwing them out of the park!
Ok. See you tomorrow!
Just for what you know, we will not see him tomorrow.
I-I can not spend another night with that man.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
No.
This is because he was not invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Oh yeah. Boy, cuts of urine

Now maybe you like it only but the whole duck in there! Who cares, you know? Now I have legs
How many times have I told you guys, you
Hi Chandler.
Hey!
Listen, I need that pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Oh, that was yours? Uh, yes, we used it when the duck was launching caterpillars.
William Sonoma
Expect it in 4-6 weeks.
Umm, hey, um, Joey will be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place for us.
Yes, so?
Well, I thought, maybe you'd have wanted to book some time with the best I've ever had.
You know what, sample? I think I'll pass.
Why?
Why?
What is your point?

So, what's your name?
It's Jake.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like knicks?
Yes, great fan.
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday, do you want to go?
Yes that would be great! Let me make sure he does not do anything Tuesday.

Ugh. Ross!
Hello! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo !!
Oh great!
Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.
I got you the best I could because it's not where you want to skimp.
You're a genius, Ross.
Yeah, well it's about $ 112, but what the hell, do you call it 110?
Ok, I'll pay you tomorrow.
All right.
OK Bye!!
So they all started, it was pretty hard to watch them go, you know?
Yes, ok, bye
So I'm leaving!

Hey! Oh, right, tonight was your party.
Oh wow, you're beautiful! Glad you can do it.
Oh well, you know, the gala was supposed to end sooner or later.
Do not go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yes sure. All right, whose ball is it now?
I thought there was not a ball?
Oh come on! He's glad he came, he does not want it to go anywhere, balls flying everywhere!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom.
Oh go ahead! Are you telling people about me?
You two could really hit it! I will go to socialize.
So you work at
Yes, ok, at ease!
I'm sorry?
No, it's all right, you can just leave the Tommy act.
I know what's going on here.
Your Danny wingman, right?
You guys are the best buds.
Frat Bros!
I'm going to talk to a friend.
Yes, yes, go talk to your friend. Tell him: "Nice attempt".
Man! Keep tearing them apart and I keep beating them out of the park!
I think I need a drink.
Yes!

Hey, Phoebe?
No, I can not talk to you! I do not have a fantasy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Look, Phoebe, I just want to apologize for saying that your method was stupid and maybe asking you to be my teacher again.
And-and I promise, I will not touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
Do you really think it's ready?
Uh Huh!
Wow! Cold!
The agreement was at least fair
No!

Well, this was fun.
Yes. Yes, thank you for allowing me to use the phone ... and for saving my life.
Good, goodbye Chandler. I had a big blackout. I'll see you.
Hi, um, I am the account number 7143457.
And, uh, I do not know if you have any, but I'd really like a copy of the tape.

We are starting to see a lot of layers of fabrics and transparent colors. For example a dark blue shirt on a pink ....
I'm really glad we came. You are so cute. I love you.
Ok, this is a fire. Oh yes. Oh yeah.
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'll have to call you back, I have a Schemp in my office.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
But ah, hey, oh, someone is out of the phone, how about a glass of wine near the fire, I could make it go again.
Ross, you're not listening to me, I do not have time to stop.
Come on, Rach, do not you have what, ten minutes?
I have not ten minutes !!
What? Sophie, do you have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross !!! I told you I do not know!
Do not yell at me, this is the best I've seen you for the whole week.
Look, I can not do it now, okay, I have a deadline, you just want to go home, I'll talk to you later.
Yes, but wait ...
Goodbye!
In reality, this is our three-hole hole.

Oh yeah? When?
All right.
I'll tell you what.
When we're 40, if neither of us got married, what do you say and I get together and have one?
Why am I not married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I meant only hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why will not I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
What is that? Is there something fundamentally unreachable about me?
Uh
Well?
My God! This parachute is a backpack!
Hey.
Hey. Ooh, look at yourself, elegant dress.
Did you go home and have you changed?
Yes, well, it's an important day. I want to be pretty. Um, was Dr. Franzblau?
No, I have not seen him.
Well, where is it? It should be here. What happens if the child needs him?
Rachel, what's your relationship with you and doctors, anyway? Was he, like, your father a doctor?
Yes why?
No reason.

I'm the armadillo of the holidays! I'm a friend of Santa and sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa Claus, Holiday Armadillo?
All right, I'll do it only for this time! But you can not tell anyone!
Yup! Yup! Please give it to me!
Yes it's her.
Thank you.
It's incredible! I-I can not believe the sign did not work!
Do you know what would work?
Hmm?
Stop making candy!
But they like it!
You mean you like them.
Could be.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Oh, do you really want to talk about getting people to like you, hilarious guy?

We were on the platform, ready to dance the world in the new millennium, and the boy shouted "CUT!"
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me that you've actually done the routines since the eighth year?
Yes. But of course we had to update it a bit. Hey, by the way, I'm thinking of catching me!
"Because I was about to say that it's not possible that you did the end like you did then!
What? We could do it!
I do not know, I mean you were much bigger, I mean, stronger then.
I can do it, okay? Come on let's go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can not do that!
Now you do it, you're on TV.

Hey!
So, what are you in the market for? We have uh, scarves, tulip postcards ...
Check it? Eh? Yes. This is the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I do not have to buy it anymore, "I'm with a stupid" shirt.
Well, I like it Here.
All right, look, will not you really buy that you are? Do not you think you embarrassed me enough for a day?
Oh, do I embarrass you?
How can I respond when I pretend not to know you?
It's just jealous. You'll be fine; all Londoners wear them!
Oh really? So why nobody wears them?
They are all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing it, in public, you know, you'll spend all afternoon alone.
Oh yeah? If you want to make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat
Good choice.
Thank you.
OK wait. All right, that's all, okay, I'm out of here. I will not be more embarrassed!

So! I'm just an empty vase, eh?
What?
You know, so I do not read so many important books like you, and I do not write make-up poems that seem to be about one thing, but actually they're about something else.
And you know what, I get excited about stupid things, like when I'm mine
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You do not even know me ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, poetry is not about you.
What?
The Empty Vase does not talk about you. My child, you make me so sad that you would think so.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe ...
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. Do you feel better now?
Oh yeah.

Ok, come on. Forward-Stop! Ok, back-stop! Ok, forward-stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross, forget it. This guy has totally stuck you.
It's yours?
Well, really
No-no-no! It's mine! It's ... it's mine.
Friend, you really need this car.
All right.
Ok, here's what we'll do.
Ok, I'm about to get into this mini-van and put it in neutral.
You guys push forward so Ross can get out of his seat.
All right?
All right, here we are.
Pull your ass !!!
!

So he said that by the year 2030, there will be computers able to perform the same number of functions as a real human brain.
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and memories into this computer ...
... and live forever like a car!
That's like Janine, you-you-know what, do you know what we're doing now?
You and me, we are interacting.
Yes, I have to go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!

David, can you help me ?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Oh, sure. This is a combination of the Bernoulli principle and Newton's third law of motion.
To see?
Yes, it's the same as "it has something to do with the wind".
All right, I'm going to get some things for the trip.
Oh, I should go too.
Oh, now ... tomorrow you want to share a taxi to the airport or Mike and I'll see you there.
Oh ... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he'll be there.
And she was like, "Oh, do not worry!
I asked him.
You absolutely agree to see you! ".
So now I have to go, so he will think I completely agree to see him!
That you are not, because you completely hung it on him!
Exactly!
And you want him to eat his heart so you should look fabulous!
I did not even think about it! Aaargh,
Hey Phoebe, I'm shopping with Charlie, why do not you come and I'll help you find something.
Ok, it will be great!
Oh, is not it cute? You three try the slutty lingerie together.
That's not what we'll do!
Why do you want to ruin it, who is it that hurts?

Julie hello! Chandler Bing, I think you remember me.
Hi Skidmark.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
It is quite clear
Ah, I owe you long apologies. I should never have separated you because you were overweight.
Is that why you broke up with me?
You-you-you did not know. Well, I guess my work here is over!

Ni-chou chi-ma!
Ross! Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ....
Hi everyone.
I just wanted to thank you for our talker before.
Oh, God, no problem. So will you go with the pending thing?
Well, I was going to, but after talking to you, I talked to Joey.
What did he do, what did he say?
Basically he told me to get over myself and I do it, you know.
So I was thinking about what you said and I was thinking about what he said and, well, in my way I got to have sex like that tonight.
.
.

Oh great!
We could not keep our eyes away all night and then, every now and then, you know, he would bend over and caress my hair and touch my neck.
Okay, stop Phoebe, you're making me crazy.
All I could think of was, you know, "Will you kiss me, will you kiss me?"
And he?
I'm a Mrs. Monica, I do not kiss and I do not say. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay, I understand. I got it.
I like it so much that I feel like I've had 10 drinks today and only had six.
Oh, I did not have that feeling since I started dating Chandler.
Wow, I will never have this feeling again, will I?
You look like a boy.
No, a boy would have said "I'll never sleep with anyone else".
My God!
I'll never be able to sleep with anyone else!
I was so busy planning the wedding that I forgot all the things that I would have surrendered!
I mean, I'll never have a first kiss again.
You'll have one last kiss.

Thank you so much for coming back.
Oh well, you're here. Yes, and I was worried that it would be uncomfortable.
I know Mona, listen to me.
First of all, I'm so sorry for my father who screamed at you, but I totally felt you.
You will have to tell me how you did it.
Focus.
All right. Um ... Okay, yes, Ross and I were going out. And yes, we will have a baby. But we are
Well, where's that turkey?
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!

No.
No!
Yup!
Ahh.
Oh, look at that Monica?
I've just eliminated all your best scores, how sad.
Ok, I'm next Do not do it! Do not start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
Oh sorry. I did not hear you on all winnings.
Chandler! Phoebe makes the game!
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yes. But I thought it was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
However, it seems that it is not worth making a whole turkey for just three people. All right? It's a lot of work.
But you must have Thanksgiving turkey!
I mean, Thanksgiving without turkey is like the fourth of July without apple pie!
Or Friday without two pizzas!
All right! If it means so much for you! But ... there will still be a ton.
No, it will not be there! I promise I'll finish that turkey!
All right, are you telling me that you can eat an entire turkey in one sitting?
Quite right!
Because I am a Tribbiani!
And that's what we do!
I mean, we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we do not read a lot or we run very fast, but damn it!
We can eat!

Well?
Wow! It is huge! It is much larger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Watch this!
Oh! You have a window!
Yes, really! With a beautiful view of ...
Oh look! That guy is peeing!
Hello.
Hello.

You know what? I can not do it with my left hand! Please, help me with this too?
Ohh.
All right. We use this brush.
All right. This stuff?
Yes.
All right.
Careful. Light. Ok, you know how, just sweep the lid. All right? Just sweep it.
Oke-dokey.

Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, technically it's not a zoo in itself, it's more than an interactive wild life experience.
Let me ask you some questions, will not you, Marcel?
Yup.
Do you fight with other animals?
No, no, he is very docile.
Even if it was ... cornered?
Well I do not know. Why?
Uh, how are you handling small items?
It can hold a banana, if this is whatcha means ...
How about a hammer or a small blade?
Why ... why ... why would he need a blade?
Well, if you're faced with a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you have to give something to the baby.
Otherwise it is only cruel.
Lu- him- he went in, he- he went into San Diego.
We come back from our walk and the phone ... was ringing ...
... He is inside
He is inside! Oh, did you hear, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You're making a big mistake here.
I mean, San Diego is all right, but if you give it to me, I'll put it in touch with a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of your income.

My sample is in the room and I just want to thank everyone who knocked on the door while I was in there.
I really helped speed up the process!
Janice!
You did not go?
Oh!
Sid is still in his room.
I do not allow porn at home, so it's like a holiday for him.
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?
Yes! Yes ... The hard part is over!
This is not the hard part, honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean, are not you worried about the results?
I have not ... I have not thought about the results yet ... I just thought everything would be fine.
Oh! Well, you know what? Probably it is.
Phoebe, where's your bag?
No, no! Give it to me!
You can not have it
Give it to me!
No
I will go there.
Oh yeah.
Phoebe, come here
Haha!
Damn you Monica Geller, the dash Bing!

What we did is wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with someone who was not alive during the Bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Ethan, concentrate. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, it's different. My lie did not make one of us a criminal in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I was not thinking. I was too busy to fall ...
Do not say that
...in love with you.
Really?
Sorry.
Well, fall out of it.
You know, you should not even be here, it's a school night.
Oh god, oh god.
They're like those women you see with bright guys named Chad.
I'm Joan Collins.
Who?

Exactly, still no child! Let's go people! Please create some space!
Honey, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
You. As if I had not done enough.
Listen, I ... I know how unhappy you are, I wish there was something I could do.
I mean, I'd like to be a seahorse.
Because with the seahorses is the male, they bring the children.
And then me too, I would be far in the sea.
God. I've never been so uncomfortable in all my life!
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember near the end
Oh Phoebe, this is a great story.
Can you tell me when you'll have cold tea?
Oh God, get out!
Go out!!
Go out!!
Go out!
!
Let.

All right, I know! I know. Yes, everything will be fine.
Oh my God. What will you do now?
I can not watch!
Oh.
Seriously, how can you watch this?
Are not you scared?
Terrified.

Oh-hey-hey-hey! Here you are!
Umm, listen, there's something I think you should know.
Oh, this is for you, did you go out with the nurse?
Yes, Joey has already told me, and I'm so good.
I mean, you and I are alone, you know, we're nothing, we're joking.
Umm, I was actually about to tell you I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just joking, then, maybe I
Well! Maybe I'll do it too!
Well, it was big enough. I-I-I-I-I had to throw away most of it.
You-you-have-threw away my sandwich!
MY PANINO? !!!
MY PANINO !!!!!!

What's the problem, Phoebe?
He canceled! My namesake was deleted by me!
What?!
Yes, he asked to leave the city suddenly.
He's avoiding me, he does not want to tell me where my father is.
She knows, and she will not tell me.
Aww Pheebs, how disgusting!
Yeah, well, do not do 'Aww Pheebs, how disgusting!' me again
Where are you going?
Well, he's out of town so there must be something in his house that tells me where my father is.
Uh, Phoebe, some people call it break in and go in.
Well, is there any of those people here ?!
Oh my God, me too!
I knew it, wow !!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Ohh, so cute.
Uh-huh, good! But I'm still angry with you.
I know. I'm angry too.
Well, do you want something to eat? I'm a little hungry.
Hey! Me too!
All right, stop it. Now you're doing it just to drive me crazy.

Ok, you can do it.
It's like pulling out a band-aid.
Do it really fast and then the wound is exposed.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we are. I do not think we should go out any more. Janice.
All right. Well, here it is. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

My God! That guy at the bar is completely checking you!
Really? My God, it's really nice.
Just do it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
I'm just saying, take your number just in case.
But no: Chandler is in an accident and can not perform sexually and would like you to take a lover to meet the needs that he can no longer satisfy.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered, but I'm engaged.
Well, you should be embarrassed.
I did it, but it was really fun.

Hey.
Chandler. I heard it was you.
What?!
Unagi. I am always aware.
Ok, do you know that the unagi is an eel?
What happens?
I can not figure out what to do Monica.
Oh, why do not you do one of your little jokes.
I'm going crazy! All right? Do you have anything around here that looks like home-made?
You know what?
She would have loved it.
Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I did it in the sixth grade.
Yes, I think I could use it. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yes, yes, except for Apollo 8, it did not actually land on the moon.
But you-you-can write that umm, your love makes me orbit around the moon twice and come back safe and sound.
Wait a minute, I can not give you this.
Why not?
Because he says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Yes, see you
Hey, thank you very much.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupido who brought her here.
No, just an old normal flying dwarf.

Oh. Oh, I can not believe Clark put me on my feet!
It could still appear.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
That's all?
I should go to happier things, okay? Umm, why do not you talk about your beautiful wedding?
Well, really, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
Um, it will be a small ceremony.
Uh, baby!
We are not even sure why we are living it.
In reality it will be just a family.
Oh, wait for the two of you to think of me as a family ?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; Do you want me to sing?

Come to me. No-no, come here to me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, did you bring Joey?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Whoa! Do you know what Katie? I must tell you that I_I_I think you are the one who is too much.
Ohh, Joey has the best friends!
Ohh, and the most beautiful girl!
You are so sweet!
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Oww !!!! Joey, he just kicked me.
Huh.
Well? Will you not do something?
Uhh.
You'd better do something, or I'll get out of that door right now! Well? Are you going for?
Nah.

How could you take a hitchhiker ?! It could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
Do not you think she asked him before entering?
You know what? I'm not talking to you! Go back to sleep! And you, you're a rapist ?!
No!
Do you like car games?
Yes, do you know the license plate game?
I
Ooh, I'll play! I will play!
Ninth! You need your sleep. Night night! Shh!

Phoebe, can you help me choose an engagement ring for Monica?
I can not understand it!
It's so difficult!
I should get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah!
Paper cut!
Now, did you tell someone else?
No, I do not want to tell anyone because I do not want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you approached me as I looked at the ring brochures.
Yes well, once again do not knock pay. I just wish you had not been in the bathroom.
Me too.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! So, Chandler, do you want to go to the cafe?
Oh alright.
Yes, coffee.
Oh perfect, we were just going to see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, not because we have the other place.
How rude.
Oh sorry. Do you want to bite?

The stripper stole the ring !! The stripper stole the ring !! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What?
The ring is gone!
Ugh.
Just a second, give me a minute to wake me up ... Ah-ha-ha !!
You lost the ring!
You're the worst man ever!
Friend, it's not funny!
What am I going to do ?!
I go to bed last night, it's all great!
I wake up this morning, the stripper is gone and the ring is gone!
Did you sleep with the stripper?
Obviously!!

What's the difference ?!
Well, I'm just ... if the dough goes with the pants, you can make yourself a pair of pants and she will not know the difference!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Friend, what am I going
Uh, Rachel is here, good luck friend, let me know how it works.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, your timing could not be better. I'm extinguishing fires everywhere.
All right. All right. All right. Joey, I have
What-what is, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so great, but you just have to promise me that you can not tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I do not want to know!
Yup! Yup! Yes, you want to know! This is incredible!
I do not care, Rach! Look, I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can not tell anyone!
What? What secrets? Do you know the secrets? What are they?
And you should not gossip!
I know I know! I can not keep this, so I take the phone
I'm not listening to you!

Oh! Yay! Look! There is a piece that has no floor!
Stick by your side!
Hey, let's go now!
All right, what do we have?
Uhh, I do not believe in these crazy diets, you know, just everything in moderation.
I'll take those to go. For children.
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you. What happened?
He was so stupid, I said some things in an interview that I should not have said.
But believe me, it will not happen today.
Understood. So, what did you say then?
Well, I said it

Has!
So you like drums!
This is great!
You know, I was worried that, you know, they might have an unbearable life situation.
All right, all right, well, apparently not!
So, yay!
Hey-hey, Phoebe, take a look, we've already learned a song. Ready? One two three four...
Tequila!!
It is funny.

Whoa-whoa, did Treeger make you cry?
Yup! And he said really bad things that were only partially true.
I go over there and teach that boy a lesson.
Joey, please do not do it. I think it's better that we forget it.
It is easy for you to say that you have not been nearly killed.
All right, school is underway!
My God! Is this a gym card?
Oh yes, a member of the gym. I try to go four times a week, but I've lost the last 1200 times.
So why do not you fire?
Do not you think he tried? Do you think about me
Who is Maria?
Oh Maria. You can not say no to her, it's like a spandex-covered lycra in the gym.
Do you need me to go over there with you and hold your hand?
No!
So you're strong enough to face it alone?
Oh no, you'll have to come.

Thank you.
Thank you. Mon?
Hmm?
Phoebe, I do not think anyone is angry about that.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Does anyone eat it?

Phoebe!
Hey!
Listen, do you know how, when you wear your pants and lean forward, I look at your underwear?
Yes!
Well, when Jake did, I saw that she was wearing women's underwear!
I know. They were mine.
Oh. No! No wait, it's strange!
No it is not! We were just joking and I dared to try them.
That's strange!
I'm wearing her briefs right now.
It's quite hot.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great to keep the lipstick.
Yes, I do not know.
IS! Do you know what Jake says? Female underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yes, the next thing you know will tell you that your high heels are good for your posture!
There's nothing wrong with Jake! All right? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Oh yes, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink ponds.
I'm just saying that only a completely safe man with his masculinity could walk in underwear for women!
I do not think you could ever do it.
Hey! I
Ok, anything.
Concupiscence of the flesh
What?
I do not know. A cowboy theme?

Hey, is it okay to come in?
Obviously! Oh Joey, this ring ... it's beautiful, I love it!
Yes, look Rach, there's something I have to tell you.
Hey!
Hey! Are you ready to try breastfeeding again?
Yes! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think it will not take my breasts?
All right, honey, it takes some children to have it, but do not worry. It will happen
Yowsa!
Okay honey, you can do it. Just open it and put it in your mouth.
Dear Sir.
I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
Oh yes, I think ...
Oh look, she's moving away again!
Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Does not it look scared?
You know, I do not really know her.

Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
No. But do not worry, I'm sure I'm still there.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, an a-gogo career advisor. I added "a-gogo".
Actually, tomorrow night a little depends on how it goes tonight.
Oh, listen, tonight ...
No, no, no, do not let me save you.
The only reason he's dating me is because I said I could bring a friend for his friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend seems like this ...
Pathetic mess?
I know, but ... come on, buddy, she's in need, she's vulnerable.
I'm thinking, cha-ching!
Thank you.
Look, you have not been out with a woman from Janice.
You're doing it.
Hello. She said yes.
Yup! Way to go, friend! You still have the egg, eh?

"Happy birthday!"
You're paying for that.
What? No-no is her birthday!
You sang Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But really
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damn!
Rachel? Hello!
Hello!
Did you tell your sister to ask?
Good yes
Oh wow!
I mean, wow!
I mean, I_I_I think it's pretty but I_I never thought I'd go out with her, ever!
Really?!
Yes, but after saying it was OK, I thought, "Why not?!"
Oh so so I never really.
I have to say you're a much bigger person than me.
I mean, after all we've been through, I-you know, I'd like to have a brother to return.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you've got my blessing.
Oh-ho, and mine!

Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye bye.
No-no wait-wait! I can not just hang up! Please, please, talk to me.
Well, I have only one thing to do today. I think I can reject it.
Yes! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
It's just that, uh, I worked for ten years in this meaningless work, without life and nobody here even knows I exist!
Chandler?
I - I'm sorry?
Absolutely not, I'm sure people know you exist!
Oh yeah?
I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
I talked with you for five minutes to kill myself and no one even looked up from the desk.
Hang-hang on.
Hello everyone!
Uh, I will kill myself!
I will come back to you.
I did not get anything.
Wait.
Uh, hey Marge!
Ehh, nothing.
Anything.

Apparently, there's a million guys out there who can play with Mac, and there's only this robot and this guy who controls it!
I did not know he could have me fired!
What am I going to do?
You know, Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I have a problem to deal with here.
No darling, you have to conquer the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You have to kiss a nice robot ass!
It's not a bad idea.
Yes.
Ok, but if I had to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting it here with you guys anymore.
Well, I actually saved myself a little for you Pheebs.
So you think Joey is more charming than me?
Yes! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Yes, you want it.
"Wishes."
Why are you screaming?
Whoa, that

Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well, it's an appointment.
A date ?!
No, no Phoebe, you must be wrong, because I know you would not have planned a date on the same night you planned a friend!
Come on, Joey, do not make me feel bad about this.
No, I'm going !!
Quite right!
Yes, you made me feel really guilty of going out with that girl!
As if I had done something terrible for you!
And now Phoebe, you're doing the same thing!
That - It's not the same thing! This is
Okay, well, my girlfriend from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
Ok, anything.
You know what?
I have no time to convince you because it's only been here for four hours, and I'm going to see it!
Well!
Yes!
Well!
Yes!
What are you still doing here? I told you, ravioli with lobster!

Sorry for the delay, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur .. what .. anyway.
Hello.
Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?
Ross.
Hi, Susan. Good shock. Good shock. So, we're just waiting ...?
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. All right. And it's-
She.
- if, naturally, you ... are familiar with our ... special situation?
Yes, and she is very supportive.
Ok, it's great. No, I'm ... Oh.
Thank you.
Quack, charlatan
Ross? This opens my cervix.
Barry?
Let's go inside
Are you sure?
Yes! Okay okay. Robbie will be here for hours.
Eh?!
So what's up?
... Flame boy.

Do you use the cups? Yup! I think she does it. Do you use the dishes? Yup! I think she does it.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
No-no, let me in!
Phoebe?
Yes!
Can you hold on for a minute?
No, you must let me in now!
You're alone?
Yup!
All right.

Let it go!
No! You let yourself go!
No!
Why did we stay in the field holding the ball?
I do not know. I guess other people do not care enough.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Give me this!
Let it go!

You know what?
Umm?
I bet you could stay there.
I have five dollars says you can not.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or simply fall. This too is fine.
Knick fan?
Oh yeah.
Oh boy, they suck.
Hey, listen, madam ....... whoa.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice Shot. You know what, he could not hit the water if he was on a boat.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
The Celtics.
The Celtics? Has. They could not hit a boat if ... wait. They suck, okay?
Oh shut up. You know, it's a year of reconstruction. You ... waah!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me take my father. Hey, we need a father here! We need a father!
There is no father.
Oh, oh, sorry.
OK it's good. I'm fine. I'm ... oh!
Oh, ok Just this way. All other pregnant women seem to enter here.
Ok.

Honey, just give me another chance, ok, let's start all over again. We will return to Aruba.
Dr. Farber, we have a bit of an emergency here ... Jason Costalano is suffocating on his catch.
Oh God...
I'll be there, Bernice.
Look, please, please do not go anywhere, ok?
I'll be back, right away.
All right.
Ok, we'll be here!
Hate you!
Did you see how he was sweating when he got out of there?
Feel sweet, if I'm trolling the ball too much, you jump right in there and take a couple of punches because I'm telling you, this seems
Yes ... I'm pretty sure I'll marry him anyway.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the boy is the devil! It's Satan in a gown!
Look, I know it's not perfect, but the truth is, in the end, I still want to be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Oh God.
I hope you can find a way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor ...?
And I hope Barry does not kill you and you eat in Aruba.

Listen, Robert will be here at any moment, will one of you say that?
Oh.
Please, now, no, every time I see it, it's like "Lose?" "Are you watching me?"
We can not tell him, you can not go to a guy you barely know and talk about his ... things.
He is right, even if he has to say something complementary.
Hey!
Hey.
So are they ready for the gym? They have this new climbing wall, we can identify ourselves.
No, I can identify you from here.
What?
Ok, listen to Robert ...
I have no time for this.
No, this is the game.
That you just gave up very quickly.
Have you seen Joey?
What's up?
Oh, just this! You know what's really my fault, because the couch is usually where we are
Hey, someone wants to give me one of those cards.
What is going on?
It's resizing my floor.
Yo !! Spackel boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you've started this, you'll finish it.
He started my first!
Build the Cinderelly unit, lay the Cinderelly card.

Come Chloe! Finish first with your client. Come Chloe! Come Chloe !!
Can I help you?
Uh Oh.
Uh, you know what, we have second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Chloe, come with me, there are some guys here who have a crush on you.
Ok, this hurt us
Hi guys. I have not seen you since this morning.
Well ah, ........ you know.
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Both of them?
Could be. Does it scare you?
Relax. It's only D.J .. of Issac at the Philly. You should come.
We will be there.
Great. I ah, see you then.
All right, rock on.

Umm, candles, champagne, yes, anniversaries are great.
Because you know that love lasts forever, you know.
Nothing like this in this life, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Oh God, Ross, I'm so sorry.
Yes good.
You know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we really can get in, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Oh yes, I'd like to.
Oh great! Me too.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.

And why do you care so much?
Why! You could live my fantasy!
Did you have any fantasies about Emily?
No! you know,
Is that why you were the only one in junior high school with that Ukrainian boy?
Yes, besides his mother used to put sour cream on everything!
Ahh.
You love her?
We said it would only take two weeks, you know?
You love her!
What is love really?
Ohhh, me
I'm a good kisser.
Then you two can, you can sneak in the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a hostess arrives. I watched porn too.

So in practice this is very easy. Read from the screenplay and try to sell as many toner as possible.
All right, I can do it! Oh, by the way, me
Because we do not do a trial.
Oh ok. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I talk to your supply manager please?
I'm responsible for supplies.
Umm, okay I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.

Kathy! Kathy! Hello!! Kathy! Kathy! (He does not hear it and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as a theme
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say "Hey!"
Hey!
All right.

Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your old blouses and high-school clothes?
Yes, I think I have a little somewhere here. Why?
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, Rach! I did a lot of things on this side of the room. If only you could launch your bags.
Bloomingdale
Oh my God, are you jobless?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a
All right!
Come on, do not peek!
Our eyes are closed and we are about to cross the road. Very good.
Okayyyyy, open up!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this
Yes, it's for our catering business!
I think I know that girl.
All right, umm, we will not really keep it that way.
No?
No, we are going to paint over the sword and replace it with a baguette.
Oh!
And besides, we do not know what to do with this.
Oh yes, I know her definitely.

You do not know ?! Rachel, you screwed up my girlfriend!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with someone else?
You know, hey! You're the one who finished it, remember?
Yes, because I was
Do you still love me?
Noo.
Do you still love me.
Oh yes, so you ... you love me!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you want to say, do you want, come back together?
Noo!
Could be!
I do not know.
Ross, I still can not forgive you for what you did, I can not, just, but sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like that ...
What?!
I alone, I feel, I - I alone ...
What?
I feel...
Noo !! I do not care! I'm not, I will not play poker one on one with you for practice!
But I did the cards !!
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Good night.
Do you want to play strip poker for practice?

What are you doing?
The key is locked in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on. Caution. Caution.
It still does not work.
Yes I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a small accident.

Is not it amazing ?! Monica and Chandler get married.
I know, they will be
Ohh, I mean two lovers, how often does it happen?
Not
No! I'm so happy for them!
Me too! I'm so happy for them!
I am so happy and not jealous at all.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
I mean, I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I want to say what is 2%? It's nothing.
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Yes me too.
Hey, guys, guys, Chandler scene?
Wh-no, but you know who stopped here looking for you, Tennille.

Do you remember that guy from the cooking school I told you about to put coriander with everything?
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Well, I will replace him as a food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Wow, Monica! What an extraordinary opportunity to influence dozens of people.
How could you say yes, and of our catering business?
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, plus I can take all of you for one
Yay!!
Oh, in that case - Yay! I was the one to jump aboard.
Oh.
Hey guys! Hey, Ross, fast question for you. Are you ready for the party?
Hello.
Hey, it's me.
I know you can not bear being in my own room, so I thought I'd try to apologize by phone.
All of me
Hello.
Look, I should never have kissed your girlfriend, but I am
Stop calling !!
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our daily challenge of $ 1,000.
All right!
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything

Are you still at home, Joseph Francis Tribbiani? !!
Umm, I think it's still out. What's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I was scheduled tonight with Joey and she left me this note.
"Phoebe, I can not do it, I have an appointment, see you later, big dad." Big dad?
Oh, this is a nickname we were trying.
Hey, you know what nickname has never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Hey!
Oh! Here is Joseph Francis!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you giving me the name for? I left you a note!
So?! This does not give you the right to abandon me!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is a chance to have sex!
Phoebe is right, this is the rule.
I do not accept this rule.
When we make plans, I expect you to present yourself.
Ok, I can not be a way to kill time until you meet someone better!
You know, boyfriends and friends come and go, but this is for life!
Did you know it was there?
No.
How long have we been home?
About half an hour.
love

Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Ooh nice.
So, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh right! I completely forgot about it.
Well, I thought a lot and looked at my life
Yes?
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Wow.
One thing is missing.
What is that?
It is time for me to conquer the physical world.
All right.
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Do you want what?
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It is the most intense physical competition in the world, it is forbidden in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
Ok, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fights, I even designed my octagonal training ring.
And I suppose you used a ringtone designer for this.
Yes.
Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.
I want you close enough to smell the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.

Is it okay to enter?
Yes, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger has again issued an acoustic signal.
Yes, I know, guess who issued it?
What?!
I am the broken spleen.
Why should you do it?
Because you should not be with him. You should stay with me.
Really?
Yes!
When you were talking about Roger, he was killing me!
Look, things like last night do not happen.
You know?
Or at least not to me.
Or with the other two women, in the morning you know I was just lying there and I could not wait to go out with my friends, but with you I always know with a friend.
Chandler!
I know you probably do not want to go out with me, you know why I make too many jokes and I've never had a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor"
There was only one woman, was not there?
No, there were two.
Including me?
Oh yeah.

Hey!
Welcome back!
Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
I do not know, I'm still pretty tired this afternoon.
Why?
Uh, sex.
What sex?
Our sex
We did not have sex.
Well, if I had not had sex with you, I had sex with someone who looked a lot like me
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Oh my God Stu! I - I can not believe you did it! Now are you absolutely sure it's a prostitute?
Either that or her is just the best and most expensive date I've ever had.

Would you look at them? Will I ever find a boyfriend? An old maid will die.
I'm your mother
Ehh?
Oh, and then Monica joked that she would not go out with a guy like Chandler ...
Hello.
... and he could not let it go, and ... I do not really know what happened with that.
Oh, oh!
And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, arrives, and Rachel convinced her to save her mind.
And then Ross and Rachel are kissing, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I do not know what happened there ...
You know what, wait, let me go get Chandler.

Mr. Morse, can I talk to you for a moment?
Well, yes, I lied first.
Oh!
Oh God
Now you know how you really feel.
Oh-oh, this is a risky little game!
Will you really do it?
Yes. I'm going to have a baby. I'm going to have a baby. I'm going to have a baby!
With whom?
Ah, it's not yet time.

You said I was boring - Ohh!
When did I say you were boring ?!
Oh my God, now I remember! We were playing chess!
Phoebe! You and I have
Oh come on!
Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off the energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!
Ok, there's a

All right, I'm leaving!
Because I'm not going to spend another day with someone who wants to sabotage my every move.
It's you, Rachel!
Yes I understand.
And you! I throw myself against you and you say no, how gay are you?
You take care of Jill.
Okay, see you!
And Bye-Bye!
Hello.
I can not believe Jill left. I can not help it, I opened a gate.
What do you say, you're moving!
Look! This is ridiculous. We should pack you !!
Hey, how are you guys?
Great! Monica is moving!
I'm not!
Oh really?! So why are all your things in this box?
Ok, guys. Guys, I think I know what's going on here. Ok, guys
No Phoebe, I'm crazy!
Well, deeply deep!
Yes, I'm just crazy!
So keep running.

All right!
Oh, here's that trench you wanted.
Oh great! Wow! Yes, it's comfortable.
Yes?
Oh! Here we
All right, you know what, we talked too much about London, right?
No.
I'm sorry.
It's just because I could not be there.
Because all I have to do now is pregnant things, it just makes me lightly.
Sorry.
What happened?
Well, you know, some of this, a little bit of that. I made an appointment tomorrow night.
See, did not I tell you? You're already past Ross!
Well
Go out!

I did not see the fast song coming.
Shh.
Shh.
Do not try to talk, we'll take you to your room, we'll take a bath, you'll be fine.
Oh thanks.
It's so sweet!
Yes.
No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
Tell me, I feel like I'm holding the fort all by myself.
Is Joey true?
Yes.
Wait a minute!
No!
I'm beautiful!
I'm the one who danced with the kids all night!
How small are your feet?
!

Uhh, you're sorry to sit there. I'm saving it for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I did not know he had a nickname.
Oh, he will not sit here.
Only people with white coats sit there and only people with blue jackets sit here.
Yes, it must have fallen a few blocks back. I just thought I had hit a dog.
All right.
Listen, you could put Kathy, I want to apologize.
Oh yes friend. Joey.
Hey.
Oh no good, do not worry.
Yes, no, stop apologizing, it's all right.
Yes!
I will talk to you tomorrow.
I should probably go.
Yes, yes! Yes.
I forgot my bag.
Oh.
No, I really forgot my bag.

A new place for a new Ross. I'm going to have you and all the guys from the finished work, once you know, furnished.
I must say that it's nice to see you standing again.
Well, I am. And that whole anger is definitely behind me.
I wonder if it's time to get together with our team at the museum?
Oh, Donald, it would be great. I'm totally ready to go back to work. I what? No! What are you doing? !!

.... and 12, 22, 18, four ... What?
I explained the tits.
Ross, but I in exchange for another box of mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
What?
Monica, I'm cutting you.
No.
No, just, just another couple of boxes.
It-it-it is not a big deal, alright, I'm-I'm cool.
You have to help me with another couple of boxes!
Lun, look at yourself. You have cookies on your neck.
Oh God!
So how many have you sold so far?
Check it. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh my God, how did you do it?
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as "Laser Floyd" was coming out of the planetarium, without even trying to sell 50 boxes!
It was then that came to my mind, the key to my success, "the munchies". So I started hitting the NYU dormitories around midnight.
I'm selling cookies from the case.
They call me: "Friend of cookies!"
Ok, stop doing what you're doing, I need padded bags, I need to lick up .....
Well, hey, who did these resumes for you?
Myself! On my computer.
Like an eclipse.

Hello.
Hey. Soaps? Shampoo? Are you really taking all these things?
Why not? It is integrated into the room price.
Yes, but you do not need it - What is this?
Wire!
Point! Where are disposable cameras?
Which disposable cameras?
The cameras? Do you remember last night I told you to get them?
No you did not.
Yup! Remember? Just before cutting the cake, I went to you and I said
Oh-oh yes, you-came to me and I asked you if I could do you a favor, and my uncle Murray came to you and gave you a check.
And then you said, "Why do they call a check?
Why not a Yugoslav? "
Yes, then you did it.
So you do not have cameras?
No. I'm sorry, buddy.
So? What? What? They left! Monica is going crazy!
Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I will help you look for them.
Great.
In-in three minutes.

Uhh, Rachel, my parents
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello. Well, Joshua, those $ 500 were for shopping.
What?
This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-this-it's not what it is.
See, see, all right, I work in fashion, see e-e, this is a real dress in reality.
È-è, they are wearing it in Milan, so part of my work is too much to wear clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report to my superiors in
Perhaps in L.A?
Yup!
Here it is.
So, have you already eaten some children?
Well, we were going to do it later - I mean umm, the next one.
Well, we're starving, why do not we go get something to eat?
Oh yes, well yes, waste this baby, I'm just walking around the house.
So let's go eat.
Yup.
You will wear it. We will eat and of course you will wear it.

Well, I guess I should have thought about my wife and children before talking to Chef Geller!
Thank you.
Yup! It looks like it will be a Christmas leeeo at the house of dragons this year.
Quite!
Lean skinny lean!

Let me see.
This.
Triscadecaphobia.
The fear of
No! No, afraid of the number 13.
Fear of
It's possible, they really have sharp edges.
All right, Chandler, you're awake.
Wait a minute, I think I have the right to use my Angel Pass for a free shift?
This game does not make sense!
You know what? You're just angry because you're losing.
Oh, come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
All right. Chandler, you can turn the wheel or choose a Google card.
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I do not care
You, you have to choose Mr. Bing.
Or, it makes no difference.
Choose, stupid!
I will take a card.
Ok, you chose the Gimmie card! Get all Ross points!
What?!
This game is rather fun.
Do not you think it's a little strange that you have all my points for you
I do not think competitors have to talk to each other.

Hello? Oh, hello Ross! To see? Other people call me!
Ross very funny!
Very realistic and fun.
All right.
Oh no-no-no, I was not saying goodbye to your lady.
Whoa, maybe I was!
Hey, Monica, this totally sexy girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Enter there man! Flirt, mix!
Yes, I_I_I'm down with that.
Ok, here it is.
How are you?
It worked!
He is waving.
Ok, I-I-I will be finished.
Let's see, she's on the third floor
Wow! She's pretty, is she?
Tell me about it, eh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, it's just Monica! Ewwuck!

Hey!
Hey!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, it's great!
To see? And you do not care if people are watching, it's just for a second cause, so you're gone!
Gone! I mean his incredible Phoebe. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Search for the horse! Sorry!

Oh, come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just crossed the hall! IS
Ahh! Are not you dressed yet?
Am I naked again ?!
We should meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah, okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them, I mean, is it okay if they come to visit them?
Wh?! What about my allergies ?!
Oh, right, your allergies. All of her, she hates you.

Shoot! We're out of soda.
Oh, I'm going to get you a little.
Really?!
No! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Phoebe, how did it go?
Well, um, my mother's friend, Phoebe, is actually my mother's birth.
I found a dry sea.
Sweetie, what are you talking about?
Oh, my new mother, who-who is a big, fat abandonment!
Whoa, wait, Phoebe, wait a second! Do not you want to stay here and talk about it?
No. I'm alone, I want, I need to be alone.
Monica!
Oh.

Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yeah baby!
So we never heard of your wedding!
We were surprised that we were not invited.
No, no, it was only our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
What's wrong? Custard? Good. Marmalade? Good. Meat? Goooooood.

Hey!
Hey!
Hello!
So, do you want to come to dinner at the restaurant in the next few weeks?
Sure!
I would like!
Well, you
Well, I can not give you a massage, because my license has been revoked again!
Phoebe, what happened?
Well, it was an accident ... You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand slips!
I've got a surprise for you? Pack up!
Oh no, you guys should not get divorced for 7 years!

Umm, this is nice.
I know, is not it?
No, I mean it, this looks really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Yes! And I also sold it.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Well, if you want to have a drink later, we can.
Oh yes, it looks fantastic. Oh, and listen, it's, it will be ....
I know. Thank you.

So? Come on! Explain Geller! First take my pregnant Rachel!
Did you get pregnant Rachel ?!
Who did?!
You did it!
Yes. Yes, yes, I did it. But ... but it was, it was only one thing a night. It meant nothing.
Oh? Really? Is this what my daughter means to you? Anything?
No! No sir, she means a lot to me. I mean, I'm interested-I-I love Rachel.
What?!
Oh but not that way. I mean, I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her as one, like a friend.
Oh really? Is that how you treat a friend? Do you get into trouble and then refuse to marry her?
Hey! I offered to marry her!
Wh
But I did not want to.
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?
Rogue ?!
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.

Yes, Fran.
I know what time it is, but I'm watching WENUS and I'm not happy! ...
Oh, really, really, really?
Well, let me tell you something ... it will interest you, because I care!
You got it right?
Good!
Whooooaaaa ....

Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men?
Hey, Joey. So you heard about the new boy?
I could have birds.
Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner.
All right, bye bye
Ok, Janice. Janice. You must give me Janice. It was not about being picky.
We'll give you Janice.
I miss Janice though. "Hi, Chandler Bing."
"My God."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it, there, faster!"
Stop with the broom, let's make no noise.
We won. We won!
Mr. Heckles.
How did it happen?
It had to be radical. They found a broom in their hands.
It's terrible.
I know. Yesterday I was sweeping. It could have been me.
Of course, you could. You never know.
You never know.

Oh sorry.
Where's Chandler?
Oh, he needed time to grieve.
I am free! I am free!
This should do it.

Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, I've been there since 4 this morning.
Where did you get fruit at four in the morning?
I went to the dock. I bet you did not know you could get fat.
I did not know there were docks.
Hey.
Hey.
Aww, is it broken?
No, I have to wear this thing for a couple of weeks.
Did you tell the doctor you jumped him up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a whole story but then Chandler sold me.
Well, I'm sorry, Joe. I did not think the doctor would buy that he had just fallen from his grip.
What is this? Fruit?
Monica is making jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never jam in our place?
Because children need new shoes.
I go to businessmen.
I am tired and fed up of being depressed for Richard.
I needed a plan, a plan to overcome my man.
What is the opposite of man?
Marmalade.
Oh Joey no!
It's very hot.
This will be just my group.

Hey, does anyone else feel bad about Ross?
Why? Do you think he's still angry with us?
Well, he's probably angry after calling him this morning to borrow his glasses.
What? My parents are not colored
Here go to Phoebe. Who else wants one of my homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Ok, I will not have one
Me neighter.
No, no, it's just a tooth of mine.
Okay I'll have one.
So, what's the problem, do you need a dentist? I have a good one
No thanks, I also have a good one. I alone, I can not see it.
See what the problem is with invisible dentists.
Why? Why can not you go to him?
Because every time I go to the dentist, someone dies.
It's so strange, because every time I go to the dentist, I look at the hygienist's blouse.
Phoebe, what? Umm ... what?!
Yes, yes, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my postman, and then my, my cowboy friend "Albino Bob".
And all these people are actually dead?
Yes, while I was in the chair!
That's why I take so much care of my teeth, you know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Phoebe, come on, you did not kill anyone, these people just died when you went to the dentist.
It is, it is, it is only ah, a coincidence.
Well, tell them. Oh! You can not, their dead.

Hello?
Ross.
Emily, bye! Uh, how are you flying?
It was terrible. I felt guilty about how I behaved when you said those wonderful things.
No, no, that ... that's okay. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Ross, there's something I have to tell you, here ... there's someone else.
Does it mean the same thing in England as in America?

You know what? I will not be able to enjoy this.
Yes, I know, it's my birthday. We should all be here.
So let's go.
Well, maybe, you know, maybe we should be for a song.
Yes, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
You know, the boys are probably having fun.

Ok, I have three of my five.
Three of your five, what?
Celebrities with whom I can sleep.
My God! You're giving a lot of thought to this.
Yes, it's difficult, I have only two points left.
All right, so who did you limit yourself to?
Ok, Elizabeth Hurely ....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
Eh, you know what, she's politics, she probably would not let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
IS!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But you know, she's too international, you know there will never be.
So?
So, you have to play the odds, choose someone who will be in the country as always.
Yes, because that's why you will not get Isabella Rosselini, geography.

Oh, it's five Ross. Five women have had five children! And I did not have any children! Why do not you want to come out?
Do you know what I think it is?
I think you've made such a nice home for her in the last nine months that she does not want to leave.
Oh. See how disgusting you are for me. Oh God!
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
Doctor you have to do something! I think you have to give me drugs or you have to light a fire up there and just smoke.
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters, you are about to become a mother.
My God. All right. Ha-ha-ha beat you! Sucker!

Am I still here?
No, honey, I'm not, but do not worry, because we'll find them, and until we do, we're all here for you, okay?
Ok.
Hello.
Can I see your boarding pass?
Oh no, no, I do not have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not authorized on the airway unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but I ... went ahead.
It's right there, it's got a blue jacket, I ... I can only ...
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, okay, OK, um ... then could you please, uh ... give him a message for me? Please? This is
Alright. What is the message?
Uh ... I do not know.
Lord? Lord? Excuse me, sir? Uh ... I have a message for you.
What?
It comes from Rachel. He said he loved the present and will see you when you return.
: Toby ... Oh, for God's sake, I do not know what you're talking about!
There is no Rachel!
Do not give me that freezing.

Here's the thing, Janice.
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
They are like bing, bing, bing.
You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ouch!
Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
Ow. Um, it's just my goal. It's just my goal. I will be right back.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break in the history of the world.
My God. How many of those did you have?
Oh, I do not know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la
I'm fine.
All right.
I am not well. Here it comes.
Wait here. To breathe.
How do you do it?
It's like a gift.
We should always break up together.
Oh, I'd like to.

You won.
Well, what's wrong?
It does not matter because nothing beats the three and six.
That my friend is D-Cup.
Ok, now you've won so far?
Uh, wow, 700.
Not exactly exactly?
Yes.
Doubles!
What?
Well, you see in Cups, when you get $ 700, you have to double it.
Really?
Hey, I did not take the rules.
Now, after receiving the doubling bonus, you get a card.
Now that card could be worth $ 100 bringing the total to 1,500.
Do not get excited because it will not happen if you do not get-No way!

I am, I'm sorry you could not go to the Spacecamp, and I hope that maybe somehow, this can make up for it.
Presenting the very special private Spacecamp by Sarah Tuttle!
!
Really Mr. Geller, you do not have to do it.
Oh come on! Here we are! Get ready for the mission countdown!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Oh no! An asteroid!

Hey.
Hey.
Where are you going?
At the bank.
Sperm or normal?
Semen.
So you're really doing it, eh?
Oh yes, I chose a boy, 37135.
Sounds good.
'So bad. Brown hair, green eyes ...
No kidding, hmm.
What?

What's wrong, sweetheart?
Nothing nothing.
Aaaah, what's wrong, come on.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.
They are my friends
They have a problem with you.
In this, they do not.
Oh. They do not.
But they do not see all the wonder I see.
They do not see all good things and all sweet things.
They just think you're a little ...
What?
Intense and creepy.

Hello.
Hello.
Yes! You do not like Kathy.
You have me.
Yes, you've avoided it since we started going out. Look, I did a
Yes. Right.
Good, and hey! My treatment But it's just because you're not eating anything, right?
All right.

I can not believe we're here.
Oh, are you kidding me?
What?
As a wedding present for you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
No!! You fucked us all day!
Who are you?
We are only ten seconds later!
Yes!
You already have the first class tickets; you have the living room!
I mean, we should get things for free too!
I mean you're not the only honeymooner!
Well, you can have the suite if you want.
We do not care where we are.
We are here to celebrate our love together.
We do not have to get things for free.
We want to be together.
We need stuff.

Yup!
Ok, well then how about a handshake?
Oh God, I'm sorry!
Oh God, I'm sorry!
I did not want to touch it ... I mean

Hey, Phoebe!
Hey!
Check it out. How much are a man?!
Wow! Beautiful! Manly is also a kind of slut.
You are turning into a woman.
which brings us, of course, to Greely's theory of domination.
Ok, that's all for today.
Oh, does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Yes, it's the new building on Avenue A.
What?! That - it's all the way to cross the city, I should teach a university seminar there in ten minutes.
Ooh, friend. Not gonna happen.
Move it! Move it! Move it !! Hey !!! I'm the teacher !!

Jason?
Yes, come inside
So Phoebe, you, ah, sounded a bit serious on the phone, it's ah, is there something wrong?
No. And I do not think I'll want it.
I can not do that
Yes. Yes, this is what I did not want to know.
Well, Mark, I'm doing it for the wrong reasons, you know?
I'm just doing it to get back to Ross.
I'm sorry, it's not very right for you.
Ahh!
Fair, schmair!
You know?
Look, if you want to go back to Ross, I'm here for you.
Really?
No-no, I say-I say, let's get back to him right on this couch.
Right here!
Oh God. I'm sorry for this.
All right.
Are you sure?
Yes. I can only go home and get it back on my own.

Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Oh Joey, I'm barely there
My little sister Dina!
And here we go
I saw this movie once where there was a door and nobody knew what was behind it, and when they finally opened it, millions and millions of insects came out and feasted on human flesh.
You know, it would not kill you to respect your wife's privacy!
Stupid closet full of insects!
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I non-Whoa !!
Oh hey whoa-whoa, do not worry.
All right.
When my sisters were pregnant, they had every strange feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Really?
Absolutely.
All right. Oh God-Ow! -O!
Ok Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything will be fine, trust me.
All right.
Take my hand.
Here we are.
Ow crushing the bones!

Oh hello.
Oh, you are. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson, it's Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. Surely we have seen each other a lot lately.
We have. Maybe we'll see each other for dinner tomorrow evening, say around 8?
Well, maybe we will do it. Oh!

Well, it's not something that a girl wants to hear.
No, do not start. Ouch!
What?
There are stupid balls.
Oh good. Probably it would have been the most constructive solution.
You have the plaster on your face.
Eh?
Oh, Ross, you're right, I do not know why I always thought it was real grass.
Hey, are you okay?
My wife is a lesbian.
Cold!!
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Hello.

Hey! Where are you heading in those pants? 1982?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they sold those designer tiles.
If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Anything. It's just old and dirty, that's all.
I strongly doubt it.
Oh yeah. If you move the basket, see what color the card was. Yes.
I can not live like this! What we will do? What we will do?
Relax. Here you keep this. This old stuff arrives immediately.
It's a little more than I wanted to see.
Aw!
Look at him, every inch of this stuff is glued.
It would take an eternity to leverage this.
You should ah, you should leave it.
I can not leave it! You dug a hole in my shabby floor.
Eh! Here it is.
You know it's nice, you know we could put it back there after the surgeons removed it from the colon!

Hello.
Hello!
Hey!
Uh, Phoebe, speaking of your mother ...
Yes?
How are you?
So fantastic. Oh, today we took a nap and my mom fell asleep on my stomach and purrs.
It's so sweet. I'm going to have a coffee.
Eh? What did you say Joe? I will be there.
Phoebe ...
I feel like that, uhh .....
All right!!
I'm coming already !!
Gee!
Really?! Do you think it will work?
Absolutely! And if not, can I get the extra ticket?
What the hell is that?

Hello.
Hey, Phoebe! It's Joey!
Hey, Joey!
Hey!
Ooh!
Ooh!
I'm just saying someone on ... it looks just like you on the subway.
And I was going to say 'hi!' but then I thought, he does not care if it looks like you.
It only cost me four dollars. But listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are?
Oh, they are having a
A little, but I enjoyed it too much.
So you're still not nostalgic?
No, I do not think so.
All right, all seven are missing.
No.
You will see.
Liam, do me a favor. Tell the kids to go slowly with Ross, it's his first time.
You do not say!
Good luck, baby.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Enter here! Ross! Come on!
Ross, let's go! Enter the damn melee! Ross, come in!

I had better.
All right! When?!
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!

I'm so sorry! No, I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry for?
I do not know ... of course, it's the pig!
This pig!

Should not I tell you?
No, no, trust me, it is, it is, it is much better that I know it.
Uh, I loved it before it was better ...

Well, yes, it's kind, an unusual house.
It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, without bathrooms.
But you know, the ocean is right there.
Knock, knock, knock.
Ah, oh, wait a second. Enter, enter. All right, so think about it and call me back.

Friend, you have to turn on
Let's go look at it from you.
No, Monica is watching a cooking program. Come on, I do not want to lose myself when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, do you know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable come out?
No, this is
Joey, why is your cable out?
I, oh! Because, uh, I did not really pay the bill
If you need money, please, please, let me lend you some money?
No, Chandler.
Listen, forget it, ok?
Listen, I know things have been a little tight since Janine came out.
Oh, it was hot.
Whoa I have.
I know!
Yes, but, look, I can do it.
All right?
Listen, I can listen to the radio, eh?
And Ross gave me this great book (shows the
All right, do you want to see if the joker thief will allow us to watch the show in its place?
Sure.

Not so much.

Hi everyone, Phoebe is here!
Phoebe!
Hey, Phoebe!
Phoebe, woo!
What?! What is the use of someone?
Well, it helps the bee to look tough in front of his friends of the bees. The bee is happy and I absolutely am not.
Now, you know, the bee probably died after she pointed at you.
Aw, damn it!
Again in 30 seconds!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind changing with me?
Hey, no, I'm in the man of the shots.

Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Yes. Yes, that's what you need a good pill.

What are you writing?
Well, Joshua will arrive tomorrow and since I do not have the courage to ask him out, I'll sell him a coat and put this note in his pocket.
Oh yeah? Joshua, call me sooner or later, guys like you never go out of fashion ... what have you thrown away?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey, what did you guys do too?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian door handles and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Without me?!
My uncle dragged us there. But in reality it was really interesting.
Yes.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean, look!

I'm just saying, if I see another image of Ed Begley, Jr. in that
I can not believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Excuse me, please? I'm trying to have an appointment here.
Well, stop thinking about me.
I can not do it, can you?
So I'm thinking of you. So?
I do not understand what you see in this guy, anyway?
Well ... he happens to be a very nice guy ...
I mean, come on, buddy, get one
Rachel, let's go. Give us a chance.

No, no, no ... why, why could it become strange for everyone else?
Who cares about them.
This concerns us.
Look, I - I've been in love with you since, like, ninth.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
I know.
If we broke up and lost you ...
Oh God.

Hey, here's a question; where did you get the most beautiful oak east of the Mississippi?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the most beautiful lace in the whole earth.
I'm reading your ad.
It looks good, eh?

Stunning entertainment center. Beautiful and refined Italian manufactories.
Oh my God, do you guys sell the entertainment center?
Why? I love that thing
You want?
Oh no
Ah, Gepeto, $ 5,000? You are crazy?
Hey, advertising alone costs $ 300!
All right, I change it to $ 50, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is it ?! And you define yourself an accountant.
Nooo.
Oh. What are you doing?

That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment!
And you can see me!
Like yesterday, like the day before.
Are you still doing your shark attack?
No. Op, wait! There he is.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword puzzle before going to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.

Yes, you're so smart!
Aww, you're so cute!
I know.
All right, see you tomorrow morning.
All right.

Hello?
What's with her?
I do not know.
But hey, I know we can decide.
Ok, I'll ask you some questions and you'll answer quickly.
All right?
All right.
What do you like most about action or comedy?
Action.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Friend, you're sick.
Oh sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.

I mean, this is incredible.
I know. This is really, really huge.
No it is not. Is small. It's tiny. It's minute. It's small.
Nuh-uh. I do not think any of our lives will ever be the same again.
OK, is there a silent button on this woman?
More than jewelry.

Hello! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have some routine questions that I need to ask you.
Really? I had something to do with Dr. Wells.
I know, but I'm a neurologist.
And to be safe, Dr. Wells wanted a more complete overview of your state, so she sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman.
That was a test. Successful. All right, full name.
Clifford Burnett.
Date of birth?
November 16th
Age?
Can not understand it based on my date of birth?
I'm a Doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
I'm 33.
All right. And you're married.
No.
Oh really? So, 33 years old and still single, would you say that you have problems of commitment?
Are all the questions personal?
Yup.
Well, if you need to know I'm a widower.
Oh, it's terrible I'm really sorry.
Yes.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and you never call them again?
No.
Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance, did you?

Hey! Guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Phoebe, it's great!
Oh, yay!
But you know, Rachel does not rhyme with draddle.
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Many things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Prison. Bail. Able to. May-pole.
All right, thank you. Do you have a nickname as a nickname easier to rhyme?
Did not your father call you Pumpkin?

All right.
All right, I can do it.
I can tell you how I feel.
Just, stand up straight.
Take a couple of deep breaths.
Look confident.
Joey? What happens?
I came only because I ... I want to talk to you about something.
Ok, what's up?
What I do is manage to create an atmosphere of support for the people who work with me.
I see. By the way, nice step forward on doing what to do.
The hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
You have to go!
Oh!
OK Do not worry. Are you ready.
Really?
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
All right.

Now, Mom, everything is going well, really.
Yes, Ross is fantastic.
He is in another place.
No, he's gone.
No no, you do not have to go back, really.
What do you mean this could be your only chance?
Would you stop me?
I'm only 26, I'm not thinking about children yet.
Where have you been?
Oh, I just had a baby.
Mazel tov!

Oh, wow! I should go. I had an appointment tonight.
Oh yeah! With whom?
Do you know that girl I told you about who lives in Poughkeepsie?
Yes.
Not her.
Yes, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can not decide between them.
You know, the one in Poughkeepsie, even if it's a two-hour train ride, it's really cute, very smart and a lot of fun.
But this other girl, well, lives well in uptown.
You know, she's, well, she's so pretty, I suppose she's smart, she is
If it's not fun, why do you want to go out with her?
Well, I - I want to give you another chance, you know?
She lives so close.
And at the end of the day, the other time, she - he said something that was - if he was joking, it was a lot of fun.
On the other hand, if he was not joking, it's not funny, it's stupid and a kind of racist.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey friend!
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day at the restaurant?
Damn!

Oh here's a lot of things.
Oh, I mean it will be at the wedding waiting for it and people will be whispering "Oh, that poor girl".
You know?
Then you will have to come back here and live all alone.
My God!
What?
There has been a pregnancy test in the trash, and it is positive. Monica is pregnant. So I guess it will not be completely alone.

Hello.
Listen, I'm sorry for that thing with Roger.
It was not right, and I, and I want to invent everything, so I brought you something that I think you really like.
Now this is just a loan.
All right?
I will do it, I want it back.
So now I'm going.
I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can not!

Hey!
Hey!
Hello!
All right, well, why do not I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor ?!
Hey, you want to do Joey a favor, maybe go out with Joey.

Well, sir, here's what we'll do.
I-I want to be with her, I like her.
Oh alright! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Come on! You would like to be careful, I could wake up at any time!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to get Rachel.
No-no-no, that's not Joshua.
What do you want from me, I've never met the boy.
Anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can not stay, but the rest of us have a

How do I look?
Oh, I ... I do not ... it matters to me.
Ok, now, remember, no exchange.
You have the beauty, I have the mess.
Hi, Joey. Well, look what you brought. Very beautiful.
... And what did you bring?
He is checking the coats.
Joey, I'm going to wash the smell from my hands.
You'll get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
My God.
Hey, I'm Janice.

Well, okay, I have not solved everything yet. Do not say anything to Rachel, please?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows something about this, it makes me feel special. All right!
Ok, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Hey, Rachel!
What was that?!
Sorry, mix. Hey, how was the movie?
I have not seen it yet!
Well, then you'd better hurry up! The Angelica! Leave! Leave!
Noooooooo !!

Phoebe! Hey, Phoebe!
Uh, ok, Phoebe?
Yes?
Umm, do you know how the other day you were talking about how you could not go to London and how you felt excluded?
Yes?
All right, well, we felt really bad, so we decided we should have a little trip together!
Ohh, it's so beautiful! How beautiful! Good, where? Where is the journey?
Well, we thought we would all go for a picnic in Central Park!
Yes, all of us! All day!
This sucks!
It is not a journey!
I just came back from the park!
What do we have at five in the stupid Central Park?
"Well, it's right at my house, all right!"
Well, I go home and bask in the triumph of my idea of ​​Central Park.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa !!
I've got a second, Mr. Kissey!
You know, I was going to talk to you about all this new, little, European thing that happened to you, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I-you-just-stop it!
I was just trying to bring some culture into the group.
All right, do not take it in my mouth.
It makes me want to throw up!

Are you in there?
Yes. She's putting her down now, it's her.
Oh, everything's fine.
I suppose I've just finished with the whole story of dating.
It is another thing in my life that is suddenly completely different.
This is difficult.
Yes I know.
On the other hand, in about seven months you'll have something you'll love more than any guy you've ever been out with.
Wait up.
Wait till ahh, wait the first time your child grabs your finger.
You have no idea.
Thanks sweety.
Do you want to have a coffee?
Oh no, I think I'll come home and eat ten chocolate bars.
Hey, I thought I had cheered you up.
Oh, you have it, there are twenty in here.
Right. Good night.
Good night.

Hello
Hello! Hello Mom.
This is a big party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearl of wisdom?
Jack?
Why should you serve food on such a sharp stick?
This is a good question, dad. This is a good question
Hmmm.
Congratulations to you two!
Thanks, we are so excited
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Wha-what?
Look at this clown!
Just because he has a bigger boat, he thinks he can take the whole river.
Get out of the way!
Who appoints their boat coastguard anyway?
what
What are they doing here? The coast is over there.
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! This is incredible! Joey held her breath for almost four minutes!
Guy! What are you trying to kill me ?!

Ouch!
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It has rooms, walls and ceilings.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
My God! My God!
Ah well, this is the living room.
Impressive.
All right. This is the kitchen.
Oh, it's really cute. Wait a minute, can not I see the bedroom?
Bedroom. Well, it's practically your typical bedroom ...
We are still on this side of the door.
Um-hmm.
Yes, but I could not see it.
Oh, shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for the nice evening.
So, who was she?
Oh, that was the blind date I was talking to you, called her and passed it to today.
Did you like it? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I'm completely comfortable with this.
Well, you look good.
Well, I do not think this, you know.
No, no, no, I would not do it myself, I mean it would be weird.
Yes, no, I'll take one of the other girls to do it.
Oh, it will be so fun!
Hey!
You're excited?
Yes! Hey, are Monica and Rachel working there?

Ok, now we need sage branches and sacramental wine.
All I have is, is oregano and a
Um, it's okay! Ok. All right. Now we need the seed of a just man.
Okay, Phoebe, you know what, if we did, we would not do the ritual in the first place.
Can we start throwing things?
Ok, yes, ok. Oh alright.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxers.
Ok, and I have a receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Hey, wear a sweater.
No.
Eww!
And here we have Paulo's latest grappa.
Hey, Rachel, it's not almost pure stuff ...

Mona? Ok, if I was a salmon shirt, where would I be?
I'm so sorry to have poured wine on the whole shirt.
Oh alright.
No, it's still wet.
You know what?
Let me go out before the sunsets.
Ooh, I have something you can wear.
Here.
Oh umm, I-I do not know if I want to wear a women's shirt.
No-no that's a man's shirt.
It's terribly pink.

Oh, it's perfect!
And you?
It is a kitchen bathroom.
All right, I see what you're saying. I go, I go downstairs and fill out a question.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! Do you think we could have a bathtub in our kitchen?

Hey!
Let's go see the show!
Ok, just let me have a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's so close.
Closer from here?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Ok, let's go on skedaddle.
Wait, I will not just drink someone's old coffee.
Ok, your height.
Um, Rachel, I'm really sorry. All right, do you want to go back together? Yes, OK. Has anyone else heard it ?!

So how did you know I was here?
Your mother called me. So is she?
No, this is a borrower.
I'm sorry you had to do it alone.
I was not alone. I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper. So, did you see who won the game?
Yes, the Knicks of 10. They suck.
Yes, I'm not so bad.

I'm sorry I will not be able to do it at your imaginary wedding, but I am
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I did not want him to start shouting at me like I was a Latour of '74.
It is Lafite. The Latour of '74 is actually drinking very well.
All right, come here. I'll do it, I'll tell him, I'll be strong.
I just called a friend of mine.
Yes?
I think I can be able to book
Really?!
What is sweetness?
There will not be a marriage. Ross and I do not get married.
What?!
I'm sorry, dad.
I do not believe it !!
Oh, dad, stay calm. Please.
Keep calm?!!
How do you expect me to stay calm?
This is unacceptable Rachel!
And I want to know why? !!
Is it because that punk Ross will not marry you ?!
That's all!
Is that so?
!
Yes. Yes, he says they are damaged goods.

So you're like a zillionaire?
And you have our age. You are our age.
You know what, you should, you should buy a state and then call it only after yourself.
What does Pete Dakota like?
Yes, o, o, o, Mississ-Pete.
Oh, oh, I understand! Pete-Chicago.
That is not a state of Joe.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
I have to go, so ah, I'll see you later.
All right.
You have our age!
So, let's go for tomorrow?
Absolutely!
Now get out of here !!
Ok, I'm finishing the places I can touch it!
Look, is there something wrong with me?
I mean why I'm only attracted to kids where there is no future?
Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's a zip too!
I mean, seriously, there seems to be something wrong with me?
!
No.
Ok, I'm going to get Frank.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and say, "Hey, let's go visit Totally Nudees," remember?
And then, and then, you turn to me and say 'Nah, let's go stay with you.' Well, it was a nice stupid move.

Yes, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, remember the blades of the roll?
Do you know what else I will miss?
"I'm Monica.
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
Even if there are people! "
"Hi, I'm Rachel, my sweater is too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and make it smaller!"
"I'm Monica, I do not get phone messages from interesting people.
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
"Oh my God, I can not find a boyfriend!
So I guess I'll run into the corridor and sleep with the first one I find in there! "
Yes, we should go on if we want to make those dinner reservations.

Article J437-A, color: winterberry.
Hi, listen, come here, come in.
I'm so sorry yesterday.
I'm really sorry.
It's just me
Listen to Ross, you do not have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
You do?
Yes, you still have feelings for me.
And, to be honest, I - I still have feelings for you.
And I wish we could solve Ross, but we can not.
It's too complicated with you, Rachel and the baby, I-I just did not want to be.
Oh God, you're right.
Ross, we must be strong. Ok, I - I'm going. I can? To remind you?
No.

I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbalist.
Thanks, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I do not want to make it tasty.
You know when the girls sleep with guys with strange things on their body, they talk to their friends.
Give me this
Hello! Ok, do not be angry with me, but I could not resist.
Brides magazines?
Yes, and I know you would say no if you asked, but I'm sorry; how nice it would be to walk down the corridor in this Donna Carin.
Oh, you would do it too! Oh, you should do it anyway. As for clubbing.
It's so strange, I know what I said, but this morning, I was lying on the bed, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
I know it's a bit sudden, and it's a bit rushed, and it's not like I do such a thing at all, but that does not mean it can not.
Right?
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete, and I know we want the same things, and when I thought I'd say yes, I was really happy.
My God.
I know. I need more cake.
Hey, um, if you get married, can I bring two guests?
Did not you break up with that fireman?
No, that was my way of telling you.
Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, keeps a diary and paints.
He also showed me the charcoal drawings he drew on me.
Wow!
Yes, well, he would prefer water colors, but you know, he has easy access to a lot of coal.
So, are you going to download Jason?
Well, yes, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay, so Jason is sensitive, but now it's like that too Vince Plus, Vince has the body you know?
So it's really just for math.

Ok, so it's still a draw, 41 to 41.
Ok, look! Now stop!
No, I just have to have two more points to beat it!
Monica, this was true too
I can not just leave! I put in four hours!
But...
Look!
You knew about me when you married me!
You agreed to take me sick and healthy.
Well, this is my sickness!
Oh yes, yes, lobster.
Yes, I mean I got sick all night.
Yes, me too, all night.
Really?! Why did not we cross?
Yes, well, because I stayed in my room. Yes, you do not want to look in my trash.

I can not believe there's a naked prostitute in there!
Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a prostitute
Yes, ok let's leave these two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I'm not going to do it with a random guy!
Well! Then you tell Roger why he could not wait to do it!

So.
So.
I just thought we two should be around.
I mean, you know, we never really talked.
I guess you'd know, being one of us, right?
I know, I probably should not even tell you, but I'm pretty much intimidated by you.
Really? Myself?
Yup.
Oh my God, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and I'm probably totally paranoid, but I have the feeling that maybe you do not.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Um, ok, oh, oh god, when you and uh Ross started coming out, it was really hard for me, for many reasons, that I will not bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy, you know, and how good you are, guys, and, er, Monica always says you're kind, and God hate him when he's right.
Thank you. Hey, look, would you like to go see a movie sooner or later?
Yes that would be great. I would like.
I would like that too. Shoot, I have to go. So, I'll talk to you later.
All right, Julie.
Hello.
Hello. What a manipulative whore.

Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's nice, but I'm going with the one I picked first.
Oh my God Chandler, what you chose is gone. It's over!
What?
Some guys bought it. I'm sorry. I'm tired of stopping him but they put me in jail!
Did they put you in jail?
The small prison between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to watch the ring!
I know I'm sorry! But you know, this ring is better! Monica has never seen the other ring.
Yes, but when he proposed me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe he was the boy.
It was the ring!

No, not that, I mean, and you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I will ... I will interrupt with her.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, do not do it. No, I do not mean for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adaptation.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's leave this weekend
Oh, Barry ..! Come on, this is all too ..
We can, we can go to Aruba!
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was ... it was really nice.
You would like it.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right, Miss Green, everything looks fine ... Yes, I think we are starting to see real progress here.
What?!
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.

My God! What does he do
Oh this is an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm out of here!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Hey!
So they were made then!
Almost! But first, we must start.
All right.
This is a test for glaucoma.
Uh Huh.
Sit down.
All right.
But your chin here. Now you will feel a small breath of air in every eye.
What?!
A little puff of air, now come on!
Of course, now I'm scared.
No, we can go together! Do not wait too long, ok? Because I'm out of here a little bit before Friday.
Yes, but I do not want to die!
No-no, it will be fun! We can come back and we can torment these guys!

Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Oh hey.
Hello.
Hey.
You have the lipstick here. All right, it's mine, we just kissed.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey Hey Hey. So, what happened? Does a forest turn you off?
No. You know how we always say we need a post office.
Yes!
Well, I started to build one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Are you building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubicle built right inside. It's a day's work, max.
All right. My word! Those are comfortable.
Oh yeah. These are my old work trousers, those of Sergio Valente.
The electric saw left me away from me.

Hello!
Another cheesecake has arrived! They handed it back to the wrong address!
So bring it down, what's the problem?
I can not say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, did we eat a whole cheesecake two days ago and still want it?
Well, I forgot what it looks like, ok ?!
It was a cheesecake.
It was fine
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a filling of creamy cheese very rich but light Wow!
My whole mouth was filled with saliva!
You know what? Forget about it!
Yes, and we'll let him downstairs in order not to be tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go for lunch?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

This is from me.
Ahh!
It was not on your list, but I hope you think it's really funny.
A scooter!
Follow the list. Always follow the list
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Ok, open the next one. Open our neighbor!
All right.
Now that you're a couple, do not we get two presents from you guys?
For my last birthday you gave me a
All right.
Happy Birthday Grandma!
It is better to be above the hill and then bury it below.
All our love, Monica and Chandler.
It's funny, yes!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
I do not know! I see! It is funny!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No, I know, because to be a grandma you have to be married and have children and I do not have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.
All you had to do was buy the card!

Hey, Joey. What is going on?
Clear tracks for the express boobie payback. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Joey !! What the hell were you doing ?!
Sorry. Wrong mistakes.
Hi, Joey.
Oh! ...Hi dear.

Man. Can you believe he had sex with only one woman?
I think it's great. You know, it's sweet, it's romantic ...
Really?
No, are you kidding? The boy is a monster ..
Hello Friend.
Hello.
Oh, it's attractive.
Oh, I thought you were fantastic in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All in all, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me in particular, which part was the fun part? Where is my record?
Oh, ah, the boy has it.
The child...? Excuse me, um, that's my record.
You must do it, friend.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever - you can not do it. Listen, my record rests.
"Yes", what do you say? C'mere. Give me!
Hey! Hey! No hold in my ER!
GIVE ME MY PUCK !!
...Now
Oh, look, I wish good luck!
For what?
I'm going to get one of those jobs.

Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Okay, right?
Did you order a stripper for a shower? This is totally inappropriate!
What? It will be dressed as a child! Oh hello Mrs Green!
Hello!
I'm so happy you can do it.
Yes, thank you very much. And again, we are so sorry. We could not feel worse.
Try out. There's my baby.
She is still angry.
Yes I know. Is not it fantastic? One less person we have to talk to small.
Phoebe, Sandra is angry with you too. Does not it bother you?
Oh, it's very-really very-very good.
Julie's cervix is ​​seven centimeters wide, that is, about four fingers. The doctor makes me feel alone.
Did you hear Rachel Ross's cervix?
No, I do not think we'll do it.
We will not do it.
Well, if you like it you can hear Rachel and then hear mine to compare.
Am I interrupting?
Oh yeah! Thank you.
Oh. Oh wait no.
After.
No-no-no! Do not leave me here with these people.
Oh sorry.
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My son has no father!

Try to feed her again.
I've already fed it.
I know, that's why I said again!
All right, guys, we can not light each other, all right? It's just what he wants.
Hey.

Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you might need me with such short notice! Oh.
Oh Monica, we're so sorry.
For what?
Well, first of all, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
And then to forget to invite you to it.
You already did it?
Yes.
Well, we called everyone in your address book and a lot of people came, but it took a long time to get you here that they - they had to leave.
Yes, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a nice shower, and now you do not even have one.
We ruined everything.
Ugh
Well no, wait a minute, it's not true!
No, what it was, it was really sweet.
And it works a little for the best.
What do you want, what do you mean?
Well, now I can take a shower with the only people I really love!
I mean, I take all those presents without having to talk to people I do not even like!
Surprise
Sur-surprise.
Monica.

I can not believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair !!!
Well, on the positive side, now you will not have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts.
Not you guys.
Did you understand!
So, what do we do today?
They have a downstairs game room! Ping pong and stuff.
Table tennis? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
I do not think so!
Why not?
Because you know how competitive you are and you're worth it, I say it's cute, others do not agree, and I'm lying!
I'm not always that bad!
Oh,
Did I punch you ...?
IS...?
... Phoebe ...?
... is...?
I have clunked your heads together!

I'm sorry, ah, I scared you in there.
Oh alright. By the way, I was just checking the shower masseur.
Yes.
Hey!
I tried to contact you at work. There was ... a fire.
What?! Oh my ... Oh my God !! What happened?!
Well, we believe he was born here. In the aroma room.
All right. They all came out well?
Well, the giraffe is fine. And so is the pirate.
Ohh. What is this?
No Phoebe, do not look! You do not want to see what's underneath !!
Ohh, I-the foster puppets!

Hey.
Hey! How long will it last until the battle of Pete?
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they are interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains going to Iran and snatching his arms from thieves.
Hot dog?
Four, please. I'm very nervous. Thanks.
So Ross, how, umm, how was it with Bonnie?
What?
Oh!
I have to tell you, I-I did not expect to like it at all, I mean I did not really expect to please someone right now, but it's really fantastic.
Ohh, it's too bad!
No, I'm saying I liked it.
Yes, you know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Phoebe, I think it's fantastic. All right? We will go out again.
Ok, I hear you! Are you able to talk about something else?
Hey! What is my turkey burger?
Ah, the one near my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fight is starting!
Ok, we'll go right away. So, your boss tried to slap you again today?
Nine times!
Ok, I had to put the lotion!
But everything will be fine, because from tomorrow I am conducting an experiment, and if everything goes as planned, my ass will be free.
The fight is over!

Ok, ok, here it comes! How do I look? Do I look like a boy who does not want to get married?
Yes! And also, a bit like a French boy. I've never noticed it before.
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Oh, just come out, talking about uh, websites.
Yes, we've seen this really interesting website about marriage and how utterly useless it is and how it's just a way for the government to keep an eye on you.
Yes, Big Brother.
Well, he's a little crazy. Even though I'm happy to know that you're expanding on what you watch on the Internet.
Yeah, well, you know, it just made me think, why would anyone want to get married, huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To consolidate your commitment! To declare your mutual love to the world!
huh
All right, it's nice to know.
Mr. Bowmont is here !!!

Oh, it's great, my friend Joey is in the movie business.
Do you know who I met from school? Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently the assembly of Howie now.
Yes, he-he-he calls me and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
Can you believe it ?!
You know, I - I - I have not talked to him for ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yes, I always hated that Howie.
No, no "How are you?" Friend, I mean not even a cup of coffee before!
The nerve eh?
Yes!
Reload?

Hey! How are you?
Good! Well, we do not see each other for a long time.
Yes.
Like your sweater.
Oh hey, right to you.
Oh, it's crazy for Rachel, huh?
Yes. She-Well, are you mad lady?
So whose is it?
Umm, I'm not an Italian boy. Come on, read your label. See you later.
All right.
He is so strange.

Do you want to play with Joey?
Yes!
You know, since I had that dream about him, and I can not get it out of my head!
And what's the problem, people always do it!
Who? Who do you know who are joking friends?
Ok, on top of my head ... Don and Janet.
Who, who are they?
I know them from work.
Both of them?
No, one of them ...
Which?
I do not know, what were the names I just said?
Rachel, things can become incredibly complicated.
All right, all right, you're right
What the hell are you cooking!

My God! How did you come back here ?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hello, fireman officer, can I - can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the garbage chute.
This is not mine.
Yup.
How do you know it?
Next time you want to download a fire alarm into a trash chute, do not wrap it in a blanket that says "Phoebe Buffay's Property, not Monica".
Okay, okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Please re-attach this, it is against the law to disconnect them.
Well! But please God; tell me how to stop him from leaving!
There is a reset button under the plastic cover.
Is there a reset button?!
Ugh, thank you!
Thank you!
There is a reset button!
My God!
Because I did not see it!
Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
Oh here it is!
Oh!
Oh God!

Four letters: "Circle or circle".
Ring dammit, ring!
Thank you.
Hey, do you know that our phone does not work?
What?!
I tried to call you from the bar and I did not get an answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Just like you told her you did it! ... Just emphasize the irony.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the porter - I got the peeper's name! May I use the phone?
Nngghhh !!!!!!!
Can I use your phone? Yes, the number of a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating device".
Radiator.
Five letters.
Rdtor.
Yes, is there Sidney there? Oh, this is it? Sidney is a woman.
Well, you'll have to wait for your turn.
Well, how much do you think it will be?
Every minute now.
Hey, this ... Heyy ...

Hey.
Hey! Some good mail?
Yes, you have something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey you can open it for me, I'm a little bit.
"Expired benefits".
Hmm is strange. I do not remember being in a move called decayed benefits.
Ok, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance has expired because, last year, you did not work enough.
Let me see!
All right.
Oh, I can not believe it!
This sucks!
When I had insurance I could be hit by a bus or catch fire, you know?
And it would not matter.
Now do I have to be careful?
!
Sorry, buddy, there's never a good time to stop catching fire.
All right, I guess I have to find a job. I'm going to see my agent.
Ok, make sure you look both ways before crossing the road.
look in both directions before crossing the road.

I can not believe Phoebe has her children!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Do you know what else I can not believe?
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I came out of a room, I mean it's a pity they did not see us having sex.
Do you know something about women?
No.
Everything is alright.
All right.

Do you remember when we went to Central Park and hired the boats? .. It was fun.
Yes. He could row like a Viking.
Hello.
Mmm.
So what's up?
Oh, you know ...
Did he mention us?
He said that you really miss him.
You had a hard day, eh ...
...I love you.
Are you still wet?
Uh, wet, yes.
Let them dry again.

My God! My God!!
Are you still crying?
As a
You know, I only know two infallible ways to close a man. And one of them is sex.
What's the other?
I do not know, I've never had to use the other.
I'm just saying that if we have sex, it will not speak.
Oh this is true.
You're the talker.
Anyway, great idea!
Umm, I have to go to the store; I told him I would buy him other fabrics.
Oh, we have some
No, you do not!

OK yes. Triple A can take us.
Great!
Yes, which city are we near?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
So why are you answering? At least you know which way we are going?
Yes, we are definitely on Route 27.
All right. We're at a stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Ok, 93 or 76?
I do not know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we got here.
All right.
Hey, can you send someone up and down 76 and check every stop, and even 93?
All right!
Yes, no, they do not.
Uh, ok, well, someone will come and save us.
Who?
I mean, did you see a car come here in the last hour and a half?
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come get us.
No! No, I'm not getting into the car with Ross, we'll just have to live here!
But if...
No boys, I will not get in the car with him, you'll have to think about something else.
Oh well, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the help to go went well?
I'm telling you, I saw it.
Yes, well, you're wrong! Ok, you're wrong.
I was not wrong! I wish I had been. I'm sorry. I bet the barium enema does not sound so bad now, eh?

I know.
Let's try a look of distant wonder.
All right, we'll see our future and think about our marriage and the days ahead.
Chandler!
What's the problem with your face ?!
I want to say that this photo should say "Geller and Bing will get married", not "The local woman saves the idiot drowning!"
Hey!
Do not laugh at him!
He is
Aww!
That's all! Take it! Take it! Take it!

We will find love!
Definitely!
Yes, I'm quite confident.
This is what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
It would be nice to have a small guarantee though.
What do you mean?
Well, you know, some people do business with a friend, as if none of them were married when they're 40, they marry each other.
Do you mean a backup?
Exactly!
Yes, yes, I understood it.
You do?
HM-mmm.
Who?
Joey.
Joey?!
Yes!
Are you serious?!
Yes, I locked it years ago!
So if none of you are married when you are 40, you will marry Joey.
Yes, we got excited. Yes, but believe me that's not how he wanted to sign the deal.
Oh, seriously?
Yes, what will I do?
Yes, I'm sorry, buddy. Do you want to go see?
Yes!

Good morning.
Hi tag! Hey, so you had fun with Joh last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh, it's cute
Then we went to this bar and kidnapped us with all these women!
Wo-women? Do you mean old?
Well, a little old, like 30.
Oh.
And I had never been able to talk only with the girls in the bars, but I had 20 phone numbers last night.
Is fantastic! Wow buddy, so Joey must have really taught you something eh?
A bit.
Yes?
How are you'?

Phoebe, we're so proud of you! You're amazing!
I know.
So it really hurts like they say?
What did you just say?
Make another eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
Yup! I love you! I've never loved anyone as much as I love you.
I've never loved anyone as much as I love you.
Ok, so if an eight comes, we take it as a sign and we do it!
Whoa!
Where did I hear it before?
Matthew Perry talks about the signs in Las Vegas.
I guess it must have been a movie I saw.
What do you say?
All right!
All right! Come on! Here we go! All right!
All right! This is a four! And where ... where is the other?
He went under the table.
Nobody moves! Ok, you look like that; I will look this way!
All right!
Here it is! Here it is!
It could be a four or a five. It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.

Well, that's all. I finished. Thank god! The sweat of meat arrives.
Well, Joey, we're all very proud of you.
Yes, I think we can expect a call from the President at any moment.
Is there anything we can do for you?
No, no one presses me on my stomach.
By the way, you can keep those pants.
Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you have there? What is that? Cake?
Yes, do you want some?
Ah, cut me a little bit of splinter.
A little bigger.
Little bigger.
What?!
Are you afraid you're going to end ?!
Cut me a real piece!

Phoebe, oh my God! WH-WH-What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
My God!
Sure sure.
Umm, could you excuse me for a moment?
Umm, do you know the other cities?
Why do not you know what's going on?
Well, not much.
But I was thinking that since those guys got engaged, maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, you know?
So, could I just move with you for a couple of days?
Umm, okay, yes, of course. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing Why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yes, it is! I go to the cinema and start in five minutes.
Do you realize that I have a classroom full of students?
Oh sorry. I'm so rude. Someone wants to come to the cinema?

Look, look, there must be a way to overcome this.
Ok, I can not imagine, I can not imagine my life without you.
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
Your good heart Rach, and, and ....
No.
I can not, you're a completely different person for me now.
I thought of you as someone who would never, never hurt me, ever.
God, and now I can not stop imagining with her, I can not, no matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
It just changed, everything.
Forever.
Yes, but this can not be, I mean.
So why is it?

The windows are clean, the candles are lit.
Uh, the belt must be tight, you have to change the belt.
Did I shoot the fish?
No, because I made lasagna.
Am I out of control?
Just a touch
Lun, I do not understand.
I mean, you came out with this guy since, like ... his midterms?
I mean, because suddenly you're like that ... Oh.
What?
Could it be the night tonight?
I do not know.
Look, he's a good guy and I love being with him but ... you know.
Things happen and happen.
Do not plan these things.
So you cut your legs?
Yes.
A-ha!

Ross!
Well! I mean, Ben! Well!
Okay, Raymond, Joey, you're awake.
Hello!
Ok, well, let's try one. Whenever you are ready.
Uh Oh.
There is a problem?
Well, this is spaghetti soup and uh, I worked with tomato.
But that's okay, no problem.
No problem.
Hmm, spaghetti soup.
You know, it's ... okay, but the joke is "Hmm, soup".
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, spaghetti soup.
How is it so different? Oh! Yes!
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, spaghetti soup.
All right. Let's do it again.
All right.
Hmm, soup. I mean spaghetti soup. I mean soup!
COME ON!!!!
You know what? We have to move on.
No! No! I - I can do it again! To see? Look! Hmm, spaghetti soup. Damn!

All right. Give us only a second. Ross!
Yes?
Give it some money.
I really think they are out of the rooms.
They are not!! Ross, they're only saving them for important people !! All right?! What ... if I was the president ?!
Well, then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you do not know where they are.
All right.
Uh, you say umm Would you mind checking again to see if umm, the private rooms could have opened?
This is a hospital.
All right.
You know what?
I must say that I really do not care about your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problems ... Whoa!
Oh mom!
Whoa!
What what?
Ouch! Ouch! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Yes, it could not hurt to look.

I'm just saying that if the dogs experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven years of dog for one thing of the human year, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, it does not lose only three hours, loses like a week and a half.
It is funny. Who I am?
The blonde woman is my ex-wife and the woman who touches her is her ... intimate and personal friend.
You mean that they are lovers.
If you want to put a label on it.
Wow, uh, anything else should I know?
Oh God, Ross, I can not do it.
Ok, fast and painful.
Oh God ... Okay. Alright. Alright. All right. Ross, please do not hate me.
Oh what? What what?
Do you know Marcel?
...Yes?
Well, in a way ... I lost it.

Hi Phoebe!
Hello!
How are you?
Good.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the cafe, we decided that I would keep the cute guy's cell phone?
Yes.
And remember how I said I would keep it in my bag so that, if it sounded, could I just take it?
Yes!
And do you remember going into my bag and stealing the phone ?!
Ooh, now you've lost me.
You stole the phone!
No I did not!
No? So you're saying that if I called it, would not it sound?
No. Umm, okay. But while you call, let me show you the characteristics of my new ring bag. Oh, it works!
Phoebe!
It is not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why not um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts there?
How could I leave them in the copy room?
I do not know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? All right? It is not a perfect world! Go, please.
Beautiful.
Thank you. Hello? I still do not understand.

How are you'? Welcome. It's nice to see you!
This will be your phone.
Is fantastic. But I do not really expect many calls.
No, answer and make commitments.
But I am the guest!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You will answer the phones.
You do not seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here's your phone doctor.

Hey guys.
Hey Gunther. Hello. I mean you're going out for an appointment with the noisy kid upstairs?
Well, it's very fascinating.
I know, it's too fascinating, but if you two start going out, it will make it a lot harder to hate him.
Well, you should try.
Joey, where are i
I do not know, Chandler should pass around him ...
Ugh, close

Oh!
See what happened!
Do not make you hope guys, we can only see her from the back or from the neck up.
Its times like this make me want the nets to transmit a bit 'of nudity in addition to the seat of Denis Franz.
Hey.

All right, ten blocks lower. Five to go.
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh sorry! You need a break?
My boots in the tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer to see the price?
I can see it from here. It will cost you a husband.
Ok I'm sorry. I think I can do the rest of the journey now. Just give me my boots.
Come more!
Oh God!
Yes, you like it, right?
Oh yes right there!
Do you want it there? You take it there baby!
Uh Phoebe?
Yes, say my name. Say that! And now I will cover you again, and we will never do it again.

Happy?! Is that what I should be Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you should be!
Eh?
Because for sure I can not understand it!
I speak to you and it's nothing.
You look at me, and nothing.
Anything.
Guys, you make me fly! High! Ok, we'll take it here, tomorrow.
Well, that was ah ...

What?! What are you doing?!
Do you know what happened?
Yes. We had sex and then we fell asleep.
No. We were in the middle of sex and
Nooo! No it is not true. No, the best time ever! Yes, you've rocked my world!
Do not worry, Chandler, it's not a United States globe.
Hey guys, I'll go out and take a walk.
Phoebe, why does your bag move?
Oh, it's not!
Seriously, it's moving!
What the hell is inside?
It's just my knitting, that's all! Yup! Knitting. I'm very good

There will be a moment in each of your careers when you get the chance to cheat another soap opera actor.
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised another actor to play a role, homosexual.
Yes, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they, ah, they liked that stupid gay thing and they chose it.
And now, he has a two-year contract with Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, I am stuck here to teach a group of people, most of whom are too bad to even be on TV.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

Rachel?
I'll be out in a second.
Oh. It's so unexpected! I uh Boy will tell you that it is an honor to be nominated for one
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
in bookings at 8:00 am of Neil Simon. Thank you, thank you Neil. Thanks for the words.
Okay honey, you can finish this after we're late. We have to go.
Please do not play music. Just one more.

I can not believe you do not want to know.
I mean, I could not not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows ...
And Monica knows ...
So, heh, how could you know, I do not even know!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
So what will it be?
Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh big now knows, and I do not know!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Or an uncle ...
Hey, Phoebe!
Hi Phoebe!
Phoebe!
Well!
Phoebe, what's the problem?
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm alone, I'm out of my mind.
Oh, right, it's me!
Hey, Chandler, that place at the table closes at 7, come on.
Beautiful.
Phoebe, what is it?
All right, do you know Paolo?
I know his job, yes ...
Well, he made a move on me.
Whoa, the store will be open tomorrow!
More coffee here, please!

Hey.
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, um, I did it, but maybe I was a little bit critical.
Yes, oh, but oh ...
Look now, Phoebe remembers, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas ....
Destiny.
Sure.
Yup.
All right.
All right. Yikes! That does not seem very satisfied.
Oh, that's it, that's one of the old ones, he's just carrying it behind him.
Keep the old ones in the back, which is so anti-age.
Well, we have to make room for fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old ones?
Well, they enter the chipper.
Why, I have a feeling that it is not as happy as it seems? No! Nooooo !!!
Hey! Hey !!

Light still out?
Yes.
Oh. Perhaps they are sleeping.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Shut up!
So, whaddya thinks George is like?
I think he is shy.
Yes?
Yes. I think you should get it out. And then, when you do, it's a preppy animal.

Hello! Hi, I'm Ross, you do not know me, but I'm your big fan. I mean,
Are not you with that girl over there?
Well, yes, a little.
Um, but all right, let's see we have an understanding, um, let's see each of us have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you.
No, no, no, it's flattery.
I'm sorry.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
Do not do it, do not fire it so fast.
I mean, this is an opportunity that happens once in a lifetime ...
Yes for you. Is that the list?
Um, yes.
I can see it?
Er, no.
Come on!
But it's fine.
I'm not on the list!
Um, look, but it's not the final draft.
It's laminated!
Yes, um, okay, you were, you were on the list but my friend Chandler raised the good point that you are international, so I met you for Wynona Rider, local.
You know, it's ironic ...
What?
... because I have a list of five stupid types of coffee and yesterday I beat you for that guy over there.
We'll be just friends.

Get out of here, you lurker! Go ahead! Get!
Hey, Phoebe!
Ohh! You invented!
Yes, I could not be angry with him for too long.
Yes, he could not live without Chan Love.
Oh, take a room.
We have one.
I know. Use it.

Oh, Monday, listen, I have to ask!
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me to his apartment, now he does it with a lot of girls?
Yes a lot. Very very!
Ohh! And I'm one of them !! Wow! Oh, I can not believe it! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, you know, it's none of my business, but you're not married?
Yeah. Oh, I just wish we could not get married for a while! You know, I just wish we could be like in a break!
Ross! I think he's trying to make something happen with you to get back to me!
So this is the only reason why it could be here eh?
It could not have anything to do with the fact that - maybe I'm a good listener and I and I put one on
Ross, I'm telling you he's using you to get back to me!
You know what?
I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Whoa!
Uh, that was your sister indeed.
She ... she thinks you're just using me.
So?

I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?!
I-I, I came to fill the trays of ice cubes.
What?!
Umm, ok, okay, look.
I took this picture from your fridge.
Ok, because I know this is my father.
Yes, this is Frank Buffay and you're right there next to him.
Now, look, I deserve to know where I come from.
All right?
So if you can help me find my father, then you should!
Otherwise, you're just bad!
So tell me the truth!
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
Is my father Chuck Magioni?
No, no, it's just Chuck Magioni, I - I sold a house last year!
And I am very sorry, but I do not know where your Father is, and this is the truth.
Oh.
But umm, you're right.
I think a person should know where they come from.
Wh-that's why I ah, ah, it's okay.
I'm your mother
Eh?
You know, I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I felt everything float, and ...

What's happening to your accent?
Are you coming again?
What is ... what is this nonsense?
All right, I-I'm not English.
I come from Long Island.
I was very nervous and the accent had just come out.
I'm sorry.
So if only we could go back to the lesson.
Umm, were there any questions?
About paleontology.
All right, look, I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I fucked.
But what you guys think of me is really important because I - I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
Ross !! You are crazy?! I'm
Well, bye Rachel!

Where are you going, Joe?
For a walk.
Oh. Do you mind if I join you?
In reality, it will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Your thoughts? Plural?
All right, all right, I just have a thought! It's about the hot nanny, I have to see her!
I'm afraid I could not afford it, Joe.
Now are you telling me that I can not see it?
Guys are killing me!
It is forbidden fruit!
It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable kid ... Why are you doing this, eh?
Ross told you not to let me go over there?
Yes, he did, so I can not let you go.
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff the great novels are made of.
Great novels?
Good ... mediocre porn

Ok, I think we can get the assessment before they see it, but we'll have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.
Now, do not enter until 10, so it's not a problem, but his assistant, Betty, comes early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
It is rather sad.
Yes, well, Betty is pretty sad. That's why I think I can lure you with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her,
Done!
Let's get inside!
Hi Rachel, do you have a minute?
Yes, of course Mr. Zelner, for you nothing-minute. All right. Beautiful. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Actually, I'd like to talk to both of you.
All right. Uh, well we can, can we bring you something Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Cassie, do you find everything okay in there?
Yes! Thank you so much for allowing me to stay here.
Oh! No problem! I
What?

You are an iron.
You're made of steel!
Let me ask you something, why do not I have to wait an hour and a half when I call your IT helpline?
I told you, we're always adding new operators. Could we focus on my training?
I mean why, among all the people would you like to go out with Chip ?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools ...
Ok, this does not help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to a place where you were popular, and you had to ride Chip's bike and put on his letterman jacket.
I went to one where I was wearing a band uniform that had to be done specifically.
Should they have done it on purpose?
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my God, they told us it was for the mascot!
So, I thought I would never, ever get a chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's ... he called me and asked me out.
And the fat girl inside me really wants to go.
I owe you this.
I never let her eat.
Oh, go out with him.
Oh really?!
Yes. Only, if possible, could you leave it somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
I'll try.

Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl you're dancing with.
Yes, yes, okay
Uh, look friend, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the New Year's countdown - I'm trying to conquer her, so I was wondering if ...
Oh, come on, you can dance with my partner, it's true, uh, sweet!
Well, I was hoping tonight maybe I could know
Ross, go over it! It's not like she hates you.
Yes but
Ross, it's not strange, he just wants his things to be unique.
Huh. Do you know what is not unique? A twin!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh, Phoebe is here! Ok, let's turn off all the lights and watch the movie!
All right. Hey-Ooh, fantastic sheets!
Oh, do you like it? Do you want to know where I got it?
Sure!
He got a flea market!
Did you buy your sheets at a flea market? Ross, come on, you have to loosen the ropes of the bag a little.

And Joey?
How do you think he's doing?
Am I the only one who does not think she's sexy? Ross?
Eh, I mean, I do not mean she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Thank you!
Now that Rachel is gone?
So hot I cried to sleep last night.

Oh, God help us.
What?
Nasty naked boy posing kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking for a favor here. If I do it for his brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on here? Go out with tons of girls.
I know, but I made a big mistake. I should never have left me. You will help me? Please?

So honey, this morning was fun, eh? Me jumping over you in the shower there.
Yes! And maybe one day we could have a place with two bathrooms.
Listen Carol umm, I was thinking, maybe, maybe we could make things a little spicier.
What do you mean?
Carol, our sex life is ... it does not work
Hey, little buddy!
Hey, uh-hey, why do not we take your shoes, eh?
Hey, why do not you show Dad how you can put your shoes in your room!
Yay!
!
Yay!
Yay!
Seriously, our sexual life I was thinking, maybe I do not know, we could try some new things.
You know?
For fun?
What kind of thing?
Well, I do not know, and if we were too tied to each other?
Umm, some people eat each other.
Nah!
Umm, you know, could we try to talk dirty?
Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
I love that idea!

Hey, Sophie!
So who was the idea of ​​putting everyone on the table on skates?
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Was you?!
Yes! Ok, here it is.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Oh my God, are you okay guys?
Are you OK?
Oh my.

Sit!
Hello.
Oh my God, Joshua!
All those things I said about not being ready
Are not they true?
No, they're ... they're all true.
Oh.
But
Oh! Oh, I love it but
Do you want to come in and have a coffee?
Yes.
All right. Whenever.

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you guys will not believe what I have to do for work today.
Yes, but, Ross
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just thought we could whisk them and then add peas and onions.
Why should we do it?
Well, because they'd be like my mother made them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes arrive.
Ok, bye guys. Thanks for everything. Oh sorry! Oh sorry!
The most incredible thing happened. Underdog has just left.
The ball?
No, no, the real cartoon character. Obviously the ball. It's all about the news. Right before he arrived
I can not, I have to go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog left free on the city. How many times does it happen?
Hardly ever.
Do you have the keys?
Ok.

What do you think about it?
Much things
What do you think it is?
Can I help you?
Oh no thanks, we're just here to watch.
Do not observe a dance class. you
What do you mean?
I think she means' You
Okay, are you the person you think could be me?
People! Last time there were some empty yogurt containers around after class. Do not make it happen again!
She could be you.
Let's begin. Five, six, one-five six seven eight ...
Ok, I do not understand it!
I'm absolutely taking it!
Have you ever felt like you're sometimes so incredibly uncoordinated?
What? Just click when they click.
Well folks, now everybody grabs a mate.
All right. And, my mother, dead, she says, you are. I'm with Rachel.
Great. It is again a gym class.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it's never been like that.
Nooo, it was not.
Ooh, and it's so nice to have this little sink here ...

Oh, is not it nice? It's so quiet, I could just sit here all day.
I know
Open your curtains! Open your curtains!
I'm so happy we have connecting rooms!
The sun has come out!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Ok listen, go down to the pool and book the chairs, and I'll take the magazines and the lotion.
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Nooo!
Damn!
The walls are quite thin, guys!

Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all due respect I'd like to donate some liquids.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for candidates right now.
Oh, pity. I saved a bit. Uh, are you sure there are no studies I can attend?
Well, here's a program of what's coming.
Thank you. Good, but this starts now.
Oh, that's available now, but only identical twins are allowed. It's a study of twins.
But it's $ 2,000.
Sorry.
Well, how about this? Experience the effects of Joey Tribbiani on the attractive nurse receptionist.
We have already achieved the results on this, and they are not good.

Hey! How are you'?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes he has it! I made cookies!
Oh alright. I'm still full of home-made chips.
But you should eat them now because they are hot from the oven.
All right.
Oh-oh! But not here! You can not eat them in bed, remember? No crumbs!
Ok, I'll be out in a second.
All right!
What are you doing?
This does not stop, does it?

You know, it still smells like a monkey in there.
This saves us a conversation.
Well, listen, it was great, but I'm officially canceled.
Me too, we should go.
No.
Oh. My does it.

Ok, here comes another camera.
Right. No biggie. You're loose.
Why do they keep doing it?
If we want to get in the car, I think we have to get on one of those platforms.
They're recording those people up there all day.
Right.
Hey, what did you guys do to get up there?
Oh yeah? Well, when you learned to dance, did you forget how to wear your underwear?
Yes!
Hey! You're a good dancer!
Really?
Yeah, well, you'd be better if you had a little loose hips.
What do you mean?
Like this.
Here, listen to the rhythm. That's better.
Uh Huh.
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
I do not see it. You're dancing with the tall boy over there. Tall boy, raise your hand!
No-no hey friend, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Really, have you thought? I do not..

Why are not you still at home?
Is there anyone?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm alone, I'm just looking out of your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
We took some
Oh, he brought her back to her apartment.
Who? Is that your sister?
Ugh, her
God, Ross has an appointment with your sister! How strange is it?
Oh my God, look ... look, you're taking off your clothes!
He is taking off his coat!
Oh, this is simply terrible.
Ross! Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking
You are disgusting!!
What?!
Ok, the melting is still active!

Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I understand if you came to hit me, I deserve it.
No, I do not want to hit you.
Oh what then? Kick me?
No.
My child? Rather serious. Oh hey Katie! What are you doing here?
Well, the delivery went to you and I understood that they forgot it.
Ah, it must have been pretty obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Listen, to be honest, home delivery is really part of my job description.
Oh.
Oh, I really came here to ask you out.
Oh! Wow! Uh, yes! Sounds good. I'll put it in my pocket, pretend
Sure!
Horny bitch. No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!

Chandler !! You have the best taste in men!
Good, as a father, as a son.
Patrick and I were so good last night! I mean, I think this could turn into something serious.
Really?! I-I thought you were not looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for a kind of adventure.
Well, you know, maybe. But did not you tell him? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Did you tell this guy that I was looking for an adventure ?! You do not tell the boy!
Why not?! I would be thrilled if I had known that a sexy girl was just trying to ... oh, I see.
Oh, between the fact that you told him that I wanted to infatuation and that I had made the first date ... oh, he has such a wrong idea.

All right, so I went back to high school, I'm in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize I'm completely naked.
Oh yeah. He had that dream.
Then I look down and I realize that there is a telephone ... there.
Instead of...?
Quite right.
I never had that dream.
No.
All of a sudden, the phone starts ringing.
And they were not watching you before?
In the end, I guess I should answer,

Honey! Dinner is ready!
Tonight, what did my little chef give me?
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Yup! And much of this!
Thanks, honey. Give me some sugar here. All right.
OK let's go.
Here we are! Here we are! Here we are! How are you'?

Something did not work with Underdog and they could not make the head swell.
So, anyway, his head is like flopping on Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking ... how inappropriate it is.
I have something in my eyes, Joey, could we control it in the light, please?
My God.
What?
Hello! We were at the same table? It's like ... cocktails in Appalachia.
Come on, they're close.
Close? She has the tongue in her ears.
Oh, like I've never had a little turbulent with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's not true, is it?
Well, who has to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my God, what were you thinking?
All right, look, I'm not proud of it, okay? Well, maybe I'm a little
Oh!
Ouch!
I'm outta here.
Wait wait wait. You want it, I want her. He likes you.
Really?
Yes. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together between us, we can break them.

Hello! A wedding please!
Yes, we want to get married!
All right.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What are you doing?
Oh, this is it
No, just because it's the graduation song.
All right! This is! We will get married!
Are you sure you want to do this?
Well, bye, Mrs. Ross!
Well, bye, Mr. Rachel!
Wait! All right!
Would you ever be a substitute for someone?
It depends on who asked.
What happens if I asked?
Oh, Monday, of course.
Really?
Yes. You're not asking, are you?
No.
Yup! Totally!
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yup! Thank you!

You will not believe it! Joshua came into operation today and guess what happened?
Did he ask you to leave?
No. But I was showing him some twins and I felt his wrist.
Saucy!
What are these?
Electrical plans for the building.
Ok, okay, should I be scared?
I know the switch does something, ok?
So I went to the town hall and took these.
All I had to do was pay $ 25 and wait in line for three hours.
Wow! If only more people knew it.

Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you are all thinking. But Chandler is inside
Yes! No, this is what I was thinking.
So I ask you please, take a moment before judging me.
Oh, no one is judging you.
Oh! All right! You, sir, right place at the right time, call me!
Oh God!
I want that place so much !!
I was so sure it would work!
There are twelve dollars I will never see again!
Okay honey, we'd better go and get that movie.
Hello!
Hello!
Hi Chandler! I miss you already.
Okay, have you seen it ?! With the inappropriate and pinching !!
In fact, I did it!
Ok, so now you think she's attracted to me?
Oh, oh my God! My God! You know about us!
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows and is just trying to drive us crazy! This is the only explanation for this!
Ok, but what about my unkempt ass and my protruding bicep ... She knows!

Ross, um, you've been there a long time. I'm starting to get a little crazy.
All right, I'm going out. Hey, you can turn off the lights.
No, let's leave the lights on.
My God!
Do you want to go now? Because I'll take you right now, buddy! Do you want to go?
Oh good.
Ready? Fighting!
Ok, you know what, in reality, it's great. This helps a lot. Thank you.

All right, remember, something so big and long will be difficult to maneuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
We can please concentrate here, the life of a naked man is poised!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are going to have here is a fat boy dead on a stick.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, let's hit.
Constant.
Constant.
Ok, a little higher.
Watch out for the angle.
Ok, ok, we are approaching the window. Thread the needle.
Thread the needle.
Is alive! Is alive!!!
Still, we are still struck by it.
All right, pick up the device, retract the device.
He does not seem happy.
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his percussion device.
Hey, it will never end here, buddy!

Well, they have unusual pet names for each other.
Including umm, bad bitch and uh, sick bastard.
Oh God oh!
Contraction!
Yes? All right.
Ooh! Ow !!
Are you watching it ?!
No!
Do not look at you sick bastard!
Honey, I swear! I was not watching!
She is in labor! You like that you're sick motherfucker!
Umm. Umm, I'm just-
To see? To see? It was because you were a fat pervert!
No-no, I'm sure nobody was watching. I just want some privacy.
Do you miss your girlfriend?
Ignore them.
Ross.
What? What?
He is watching me.
Hey! Do you want to live to see your child?
Do not talk to my husband like that stupid bastard!

Pat Sajak?
Yup!
Alex Trebek?
Oh, sure!
Chuck Woolery?
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single presenter of games, the ass that I can not kick.
Say that!
Let's say we are unagi!
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Say that!
You know what? I can easily get out of this, but there's a chance you can do very, very bad!

Hey, Rach, I can borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yes, it's in there.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oohh !! Ohh! Oh oh oh! Oh, oh !!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!!!
Yes, yes.
You?! And-and you?
Yes, but you can not tell anyone! Nobody knows!
Such as?! When?!
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a big deal.
But it's a big deal !! I have to tell someone!
No-no-no-no-no! You can not!
Please? Please?! We simply do not want to talk to everyone, ok? Just promise that you will not say it.
All right! Friend, it's amazing! I mean, it is
I know, it's great!
Aww, I do not want to see it!
We are so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They are trying to get Joey!

And my second-grade teacher was Mrs. Thomas, and my first-grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Madam, Mrs. Gobb?
No Cobb, like in the cobb salad.
Now, what exactly is there in a cobb salad?
Ahh!
What we will do? What we will do?
Uh, we'll think about it. Ducks or clowns.
Oh, will we turn around for the baby?
Do you have a better idea?
All right, call it in the air.
Heads.
Heads is.
Yup! Thank god!
We must assign heads to something.
Right. Ok, ok, the ducks are heads, because the ducks have their heads.
What kind of scary ass clown arrived at your birthday?

Ok, some tricks of the trade.
Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I'll take a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers and start pulling.
Oh, oh, let's say I want to say that I just did something bad.
This would be the principle "I have a hook in an eyebrow and I like it" Ok, let's say I've just received bad news, all I do is try and divide 232 by 13.
And that's how it's done.
Great soap opera acting tonight all, fired class.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
Then I'll have to ask you to keep it down.
Who are you?
Hi, I'm Eric, I'll be Chandler's new roommate.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
I-I-I do not think so
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
But, he told me on the phone.
He told me in person.
That's strange.
Well, now I'm going to my new apartment. Ehh!

Hey! Look who I found!
Oh, hey guys!
You know, birds have a great sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Yes, if the gifts are hidden south for the winter.
Or could we simply follow your clever lines - some ideas?
No!
I did not think so!
Ok, come on guys, show us where the presents are!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica made me trash! Hmm, I wonder what could I do with Monica that's as good as trash?
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Hey, this is empty.
What?
This bench is empty! I can not believe I never knew it! Oh, the gifts !!!
No, do not look at them directly!
What?
All right, no, we could watch them!
I

Hello! I'm so happy you're here, but it will take a while. I-I wished you had called first.
Oh, all right, I'll be back with your father later.
Oh good.
I needed to talk to you before birth.
Ok, what's up?
I brought something I want to give you, naturally assuming you want it.
But, are you asking me to marry you?
This is your grandma's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
Mom no, let's go! Thank you.
Listen to me!

Perhaps it would have happened if I had been more polite, or had paid more attention, or I ... had a womb.
I can not believe!
I know no, no, you know you do not deserve this, you do not Ross.
You're really, you're so good.
Thank you.
And you're so sweet. And you are kind
Thank you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Eh?
OK it's good.
Oh.
Wait wait wait.
What?
My foot is stuck in my pocket.
What?
No, I can not get it out.
Rachel?
Yes. Hello Mark!
Hello. I just talked to Joanna and she loves you. You understand, you found the job.
Oh, I did it!
Yup.
My God!!
Congratulate !! -lations-regulations.

I can not believe I did! What an idiot!
Oh, stop beating yourself!
People make mistakes!
These things happen!
There are no messages you forgot to give me?
Apparently you are not very good!
I
Philadelphia.
My God! She too! Oh, I ... I have goose bumps.
Really?
Well, you know I'm wearing layers and it's hot.
Yes, yes.
But if not, okay. These idiots may not be interested in you, but the universe is! And that says a lot!
Did you hear it ?!
I do not need you guys to worry about me!
Because the universe matters!
The whole universe!
I really wanted them to care a little bit.
You know, I do not know ... I do not think it's you.
This is a bizarre place.
Hey!
Guys!
Oh no, it's you.
Yes.

I like this. It seems to say "I love you and that's why I have to kill you".
They can not all be bad. Find the one in which you make the eyes of your bedroom. Ohh, here it is.
My God! These are the eyes of my bedroom? Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull that thread?
I'm really enjoying it!
Me too! I'm sorry that that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Ohh. No, all right, he's a friend.
Hey, I do not mean to be presumptuous but tomorrow I have these two tickets for the ballroom finals if you want to go?
Yeah, well, you know, I mean, I missed the semi-finals, so I'd be lost.
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and ... Oh no! No! No! My God!
Ok, do not go crazy. I will go.
No, it's Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I can not take care of her now. That woman is crazy!
Ok, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Yes?
Yeah, um, that's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there, now you think you can hijack her so we can slip out?
What?! No!
All right, but I have two tickets for the dance prom.
Look, I do not think so, Phoebe. Ok I will. But only because you are a friend.

Well, I_I_I ended up with this. Do you want something Ross? Sports? International? Apartments ads?
I will take some sports.
Mine!
All right. Uhh, international.
Okay, look, I ... I know what you're going to say to you guys
You two will have very hairy children.
Ok, I did not know you would say that.
Ross! Janice?!
All right, wait!
Hold on.
Hold on.
This is Ross, okay?
He is our friend.
Obviously he went crazy.
Obviously he lost his mind.
Look, me
So you'll see her again?
Phoebe! Do not put ideas in your head!
I
Damnit Phoebe !!

Hey, we do not have to ...
Yes, we have, um-hmm.
Umm, I think you're really, really great ...
Oh God!
Here we go again.
Why does it keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?
It's my fault?
Or am I just crazy?
I-I-I-I-I do not know, I do not know what to say.
Hey man, this is a family place, put the mouse in the house.

Wait!
Terry!
Please!
Look, I just lost my other job.
All right?
You have no idea how much I need this.
Please help me, for the good of old times.
This poor boy has been in a coma for five years. It is hopeless.
It is not without hope! Dr. Stryker Ramoray is a miraculous. Look, here it comes.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
I'm back baby! Hahaha!

That guy really kicked me on the plane.
Well, you pulled your hair.
He took my snack!
I will not be back!
All right! Oh God, you know what? It's really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. All right.
This does not mean anything, does it?
Obviously! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if I did not have a car! Right?
This is true.
Yes, but only a genius could swallow a sonic blaster cannon.
Oh, I've been there. Yes, I'm going to drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you do not really have it.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in the character! Would you talk to her?
Ah, I think it just changed. He's really kidding me.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
What?! No, you can not, you can not leave me here with them! We are baby-sitters!
The children sleep, I'm sure you'll be alone for a while!
But you-you can not leave me with them! We-we are a team! We are playing an area! They will triple me!
He has something plastic in his mouth, we have to go to the hospital.
But no, because a doctor will not be able to help him, he will know that he will naturally go through his system in about seven years.
I think it's rubber.
I'm pretty sure it's a gun.
Ok, listen, this really hurts. Here we go.
A real man would never have run to the hospital! No! What would you do, what would Krog do?

That was the only way I could do it
Hello! How are the Gellers?
Do not call us that!
The judge would not allow us to get a cancellation! Now we have to get divorced !! Did you throw up a Porsch?
Hey! It's Porsche !!

Hey honey!
Hey!
There is no return to this sofa!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of thing.
Yes, I know, but I imagined a shot, you know?
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you would not think I was, I know, all dead inside.
Oh, it's so sweet! Look Chandler, I do not care if you can not cry, I love you.
Oh, this makes me feel so hot in my tin trunk.
Stop that!
No, I mean, come on, think about it seriously, we get married, we're at the altar and I'm like that.
I do not care, because I know you will feel everything here.
Yes?
Indeed it is!
What, do you think I would only use my son as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
All right, I'm sorry.
I have to fake Ben.

The cart is completely empty! My God, the neighbors have eaten all the sweets!
Well, or that or uh
Joey !!
Yes?
Did you eat all the candy nearby?
Uh well yes, that was the plan, but when I arrived there were only a couple of pieces left!
Yes, and they've been coming all day. They love it!
Do they love my sweets? Oh God!!! I have to go do more !!
Hey Mon, you could also make some lasagna, because something huge could have happened.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my sweets !!
My stole my newspaper! It's like a
Sure!
Yes, since you told me that story about that bike, I ... I could not stop thinking about it.
I mean, everyone should have a-a
Oh my God Ross !!
Do you like?
I
Yes?
Hello dear
And there's dad!

There he is! There he is!
Where is it?
Right where we were watching all night!
He's so cute!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yes, forget it! Throw the towel! Please drop - wowww.

I have to tell you, Bob is fantastic.
Yes, is not he?
It's so nice to meet a guy who's smart and funny and has an emotional age over, like eight.
Do you know what else? It's incredible in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Huh. Beautiful.

and the miracle was that little oil that should have lasted only one day, burned for
Eight full days.
That's right, and that's why we're celebrating Hanukkah today. The end.
Awesome!
Yes?
My favorite part was when
The Armadillo was not really like that
Hey!
Oh.
Wow! It seems the Easter Bunny's funeral is here.
Come on, come on, let's stay-we're lighting candles!
Oh.
Oh.
Ok, I understand why

He says: "Walking with you makes this strange city feel at home".
Yes sure. Good luck!
I'm quitting !! Woo-hoo! I'm fine!! I'm fine!!
Wow! It's exciting, you went to Japan, you invented a woman.
What?
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean it's fictitious. No?
Why would you say that?
Because you're still in Monica.
So you told her that there was someone else, so she would agree to work with you, so why do you think if you spend a lot of time together, maybe something could happen, and ...
You're good. You're good!
Yes, no, I'm quite intuitive and sensitive. It's a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you will not tell her anyway?
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Many thanks.
No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

Excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello.
For God's sake, will you let go? There is no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I understand.
Oh, thank you, sweetie.
No problem. I can not wait for you to meet my friends.
Really?
Yes.
Do not you think that they will judge and ridicule me?
No, no, they will. I alone ... er ...
I can not wait
I know you?
Oh my God, little Stevie Fisher? How have you been?
Well, well, I'm a lawyer now.
You can not be a lawyer. You are eight years old.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I have to run behind the scenes.
Uh, wait, backstage?
Oh yes, my company represents the band.
Ross.
Chandler.
How are you?
Look, do you guys want to meet the group?
Come on.
So, are you one of those who made fun of my father?

Do you have respect for your body?
Do not you realize what you're doing?
Hey, you know, I had you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
The bottom line is that smoking is nice, and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to talk to you.
Really?
He does?
Hey, buddy, how's it going!
Oh, he told you, eh.
Well, yes, I have one every once in a while.
Well, yes, now.
Well, it's not that big ... well, it's true, .. Gee, you know, no-one has ever said it before.
All right, thank you!
God, it's good.
If only she were a woman.
Yes.

Hey, Frank.
Listen, ok, I know you think I liked this totally bad thing, but I did not.
There is someone here who can explain it better than me.
Hi Frank.
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Phoebe is right, Frank.
I know it's hard to hear, but it would have been wrong to do it.
I-I-I was selfish, even if we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not do it.
That's it, is that what it is?
Yes, but not only.
Right, not just that. Umm, even if we love each other as much as we do, nonetheless
Nonetheless.
Nonetheless. Umm, you're too young to really know what you want.
Exactly, exactly.
All right, it's a good kiss goodbye, all right.
Bye Bye.
Ok, no, the important thing is that you understand what I'm saying, you know, but you know, this is clearly wrong.
Ok, I have decided that I will let this happen!
Ok, can I take my bag?
All right, all right, good.
.

Oh, look, look.
The last candle is about to burn.
10, 9, 8, 7 ... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48 ....
Thank you.
Thank you.
A little ... ghostly without lights.
Bwah-hah-hah!
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah ...
Oh oh oh.
Hey, Ross. This is probably not the best time to get it up, but you have to organize a party for Monica.

All this stuff takes up a lot of space. Hey, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
You threw them away!
Oh, I can not tell you how beautiful it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
I mean ... uh, did you know you were putting words in your mouth with me?
I was
No, it's okay! It made me feel like a rockstar!
My God! I am your
I'd better not find you naked in my hotel room!
Look, I took it too far!

Ok, Monica: red right foot.
You could have played
Thank you.
Ok, Phoebe: blue right hand. Good.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the
Oh ok. Do you take my place?
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Nooo!
Hello?
Oh yes, no, I know, I-I did not use it much.
Oh, well, thank you, but, I'm fine, really.
Green. Broke
I have magic beans. It never matters.
Left, left-aww!
Ohhh ... I'm fine.

Hey!
Please tell me that you received the message!
What message?
The actor who played with Mac could not do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the blackboard!
I wrote it on the blackboard, then I went around all over New York looking for you!
I went to Ross's!
I went to the cafe!
I went anywhere they made sandwiches!
Is it the day you die? See, sir, I shuffleboard that day.
This is what you think.
Well, I mean what about your grandmother's friends? Would not they have the recipe?
Well, you know I could have relatives in France who would know it. My grandmother said she received the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What was his name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Nestle Tollhouse
Oh, you Americans always slaughter the French language.
(grabbing a lot of
Yup!! Oh.
I can not believe I spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my closet all the time!
I know! See that it's stuff like that and that's why you're burning in hell !!

So, we are decided, no on the plaid, yes on the rose?
Absolutely!
I'm so on board!
Rachel, did not you just turn it on?
Yes, I did, but you know what? I'm really trying to cut, you know? Good luck, Rach.
Actually I thought about quitting recently.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting, but every Monday morning is like
Tell me about it!
Well, then let's leave! We will stop! We leave everyone!
Looks interesting.
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh, but you could.
Can.
Absolutely!
We can help each other!
We can get - what are those - those patches!
We could be like Patch Sisters!
Oh, you know, we really should stop. Ok, let's leave!
Yup! Great! Give me those butts! From! From!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Alright then!

I am divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Well, maybe it's a competition, you know? Like, do you collect all five?
Someone wants to see?
Nooo!
Oh, hey, do not do it! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw!
Big deal!
How Joey's constant crackling is not annoying?
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
I mean, what the hell is that thing?
... I accept all those faults, why can not you accept me for this?
... The knuckle crunch annoys everyone?
Well, I could live without it.
Well, it's a bit annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, do not listen to him, Phoebe, I think it's catchy.
Oh, "you do it, do not you?"
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"In fact there is not" ... I should really go back to work.
Yes, because otherwise someone could get what he actually ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out and the gloves light up.

Awww! Mel Torme is dead.
Joey, that newspaper is like a year!
Aw! It means the
Hey.
Hey.
Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure?
Well no. But, I bet, you probably know that.
Probably?
Yes, I do not like that word.
Type of thing means "probably" actually.
Yes, uh-huh.
Yes, oh, "Probably your mother will not kill herself", you know?
I'm sorry, but I'm not suspending all my hopes on Rachel and the fact that I live together on-on "Probably!"
You know?
You have to take care of yourself!
In
Bing does not seem so strange now, does he?

Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to greet his future bride.
Ohhh! Wow! It takes your breath away, right?
He is a guardian. How do you feel?
Oh I'm fine.
I can only say, I really admire what you are doing. Raising it alone.
Oh, I will not do it alone. I have Ross.
Oh sure. Now. But what happens when he meets someone else and gets married?
Well, then he has a divorce, it's Ross!
I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they will be there until their real family begins.
Well, I ... it will never happen with Ross.
Oh well, this is what I thought of my first husband, now I'm lucky if my son will spend the weekend with his father, the twins and little Mrs. New Boobs.
All right.
And Tim I just want to say, good luck here.

Hey. Who is that?
New people.
What happened to the Disgustington?
They are having their baby!
Ross is not right, we arrived here first!
Immediately after you left, they brought it to you.
Oh, but not before he gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie who is crowning herself.
Wow! Sorry. So, how are the new people?
Phoebe?
Yes?
Look at that guy near the window, wow!
It's terribly short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good at bed.
Oh, what's wrong with me lately?
I mean, it's like every boy I see, I mean, look here.
Look at that guy, for example, I mean he's not normally someone I'd like to be attracted to, but right now, with the way I feel, all I want to do is tear off his tracksuit pants and baby carrier.
Wait a second! This is the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yes.
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start to go crazy.
Really?! So this happened to you?
Oh absolutely yes!
Oh, and keep in mind, now, I was bringing tercets like that, you know, I've been in medicine ... I was three times more randy.
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from one shop to another sitting on Santa's lap.
Yes. Yes, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout from Evander Holyfield from a

Ugh!
I do not know what I'll do!
I called the company he sent and ... he does not care!
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this is not an emergency, then what is it?
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hey
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
And the guys at work really enjoyed it.
You know, one of them had never been to a graduation party before.
Yes!
And ... and another had never been to a party before, so
So, hey, that, that faith, eh? Friend, it's cute!
Yeah, for sure!
I was thinking that I could choose one of those children for me, I could want one
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So could you say that the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations and every bride who wore it has had a long and happy life.
So you could say, it's a magic ring.
MY GOD!! I did not believe it until you just said it !!

Well, of course, only one of us can go out with her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well, now let's look at it objectively, I think I should go out with her
Uh Huh. Uh Huh.
It's interesting, but take a look. I attend her
Yes, yes I like it, but only to go in another direction
Ok ok. This can go on for a while.
Yes, we should order food.
No Joey! Listen, why not, why do not we let her decide? All right? Hey-hey, we'll do it
It seems legit.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
Ah yes, wait a second now!
Look, we'll have to set a spending limit for the date.
I do not have the money to take her to an extravagant place like that.
Well, I'm sorry, this is what I do on dates.
All right, I guess I'll have to do what I do on dates.
So we decide the spending limit
Yeah. Uh, a slice of six dollars?
I thought more than a hundred.
All right. Can I borrow $ 94?

Hello again.
Hey!
Hey!
Thanks a lot.
Oh, do not thank me, thanks to that fool who never showed up. Ok, I have to go to work.
Do you want help with that?
Oh no thanks, I understand. No I do not!
Whoa! Are you OK?
Thank god! He got up quickly, he was in a hurry.
It's hot. E-and humidity.
This is a difficult combination.
Do you want to come for a lemonade?
As if I did not believe it. Wow! This is a nice place.
What do you mean?
Remember how did you say that you were very dense for poetry? Oh.

Oh!
Hey, someone left their keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Transcriber's Note: Oh come on!
Who would leave the keys of his Porsche behind?
If I had a Porsche, I would have the keys surgically attached to my hand!
Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yes, that's what I drive. I earn four dollars an hour, I have saved for 350 years!
Na-uh! Hey, did anyone lose the keys?
Joey, why do not you put them in the lost world?
Is there a lost and found? My shoe!
Have you left a shoe here?
Well, I did not realize it until I got home.
I would not have walked all the way with a shoe!
You know what?
I'm going to look for the car of that type and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh well, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thank you.

Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he will not sleep.
Carol, we've been there before, okay?
We have fun.
We laugh, let's play.
It is as if we were father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is fantastic with him. Do not be so surprised. I'm a lovely person
Oh, it's so cute.
Oh, I got it for him.
My moms love me It's smart
Hello?
Oh, bye, Ju - Hi, jew!
Uh Huh?
Uh Huh?
Ok. Um, of course, it would be great.
See you then.
Hello.
Did you just say hello, jew?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did it. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yes he likes it. He reaffirms his faith

Now here you are! I would not want my best guest to force his eyes!
Thanks Monica!
Does this smell annoy you?
What's the smell of Joey? No, I can barely smell it here.
Well, let me know if you can, because you know I can make a cake to cover it.
I smell it a bit, baking the cake.
All right!
All right.
Hello? Oh yes, a minute please. And for you. He is the inspector of fire.
Oh! Hello? Yes, this is Phoebe. Really?!
Yes, so it turns out that it was not the hair straightener that started the fire.
No-no, it was the candles.
It is not very good to leave the candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in the school of fire is Uhh Uhh Okay.
Well, I have to go now.

Joey proposed me.
He is crazy ?! You just had Ross's daughter!
Well, I_I said yes.
What?!
You are crazy?
You just had Ross's daughter!
It is so inappropriate.
No, it's worse than that.
It's wrong.
It's ... It's bigger than mine!
I know.
You can not marry him!
Why not? I do not want to do it alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
Well, do you love him?
Sure.
Sure?
Yes, I mean anything.
Honey, the question is ... do you really want to marry Joey?
No. No, I do not know. Could you be a dear and go and tell him?

So you two are married eh? What happened? Have you just left?
Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
I want to wear it every day.
You're so beautiful.
I'm so happy for me.
Hello?
Hey! Did Chandler show up?
Yes, we got it back. It's all OK.
Damn!
Uh, you know what?
I'll tell you who hurts!
It hurts the guy who stole all his clothes in a gym class, so he has to go to the principal's office with nothing but a catcher's glove!
That was it
I will be! Listen, I do not want you to teach my son that stuff anymore. All right?
Beautiful.
Good, but I'll let you know that once I taught him that stuff called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
And I liked being Aunt Rachel, but I'll come back to being boring and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
No, that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys are tying but me
Look, he has no brothers or sisters, someone has to teach him this stuff!
And I did not teach him anything that a normal 6 year old does not know anyway!
Crap!!
I have to go!

Look that! Look that! They are going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
No.
Me neither! We must enter!
Just make your place.
My God! Oranges!
Shh! It's nice to see you again.
Sir, can I see your tickets please?
Yes of course.
I'm sorry, would you like to move your thumb? I can not see the seat number.
Oh, all right, I memorized it. It is 1A.
All right. Mrs. Green! Ok, I'm really sorry! I'm apologizing for ... Okay, I bit my tongue, but I am

Hey! See who's back! She's the birthday girl! How do you feel the birthday girl?
Well, I feel good, but I think you're screwing the rest of the kids.
What?
All right!
You know what?
I realized that it was stupid to get angry for not having a husband and children.
All I really needed was a plan.
See, I want to have three children
Oh let me guess, and you want to have them all at the same time and you want to have them for your brother.
As I was saying, I should probably have the first of three children when I'm 35 and gives me five years.
I love this plan!
I want to marry this plan!
You spent a hundred dollars. This is the limit. You're screwed!
In fact, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically
Oh, oh! So this is how it will happen? Yes, I can break the rules, you know!
Oh yeah? What will you do?
I do not know.
Why am I not surprised?
Do you know what Ross is? I will not let you escape with this!
I do not think you have much choice.
Well we'll see!
Bye Bye!
Yes bye bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Yes. Yes. Only here and there.

Pope?
I'm here!
Hey!
Hello. God, it seems that yesterday you came out to watch me work.
Dad, we can not believe you're selling the house.
Well, it is time for a new family to start their memories here and it is hoped that their control will be clarified before finding the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
We take our things and leave from here.
I am sorry that we can no longer memorize your childhood things.
Oh, all right, I can not wait to see everything again! All the memories
Well, I do not know what's in the boxes below, but I know there are six or seven
in the past
Yes, not as much as you loved playing the raw meat eater.
Hey, it's unreasonable to expect a child to wait for one

Ok, I opened my mouth.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a Ben hospital worker. It's Ben ... to the rescue!
Ben, are you ready?
All right, give me your foot.
Okay, at three o'clock, Ben.
One two Three.
OK, that's it, Ben.
What do you see?
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark outburst. Wait. Yes, it is indeed a dark outburst.
Phoebs, it's open! It's open!
Wait! You forgot your legs!

You have a very impressive resume, Miss Green. I especially like what I see here about the implementation of a new storage system.
Thank you.
Archiving system?
Oh, oh!
You mean those - those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
Surely he rejoiced the inside of the files.
Well, they ... they do more.
I have noticed that you have been entrusted with many rather important responsibilities.
Yes, Joanna was really an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel was really amazing in getting my morning bagel for me. It's incredible how you almost do it
I-I-I, of course, have more responsibility for this.
Oh yes, well, there's coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes, it's very good. Now, much of this work is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that
And Rachel should not have any problem with that. The only problem could be a bit 'too friendly, if you understand what I mean.
I like working with designers!
With them, under them, what is the difference? Eh, Rach?

Chandler, do you have an assistant, do you?
Called? You told her I was sick, right? Always tell him I'm sick!
Chandler, listen to me baby, I know you can do it. All right? You have a beautiful smile.
I want it?
Yes! All right, maybe you do not have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try to look sexy.
All right.
Or not.

Where's Chandler?
Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!
How did you find out?
Hey! What are you doing here again?
Relax, Ross. She is not made of ice cream!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I've arranged the states geographically ...
What happened in Atlantic City ?!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Did not you hear me say "Du-ude?!"
And this girl is eyeing Chandler, okay?
So after a while he ... he goes to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler is not the kind of guy who only goes to bars and gets out with the girls, and you're right, Chandler is not the kind of guy who only goes to bars and has sex with the girls.
Did you kiss a boyfriend? !! My God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very nice boy.
Oh, Monday, I laughed so hard
Ho-ho, so strong that we had to throw the underwear back?
Any guy, you kissed a guy.

So, will you stay with me as long as I need you?
Of course I am!
Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.
I've read all kinds of books about pregnancy and childbirth, but I-I was not just thinking about reading the part about what to do when the baby comes.
And ... and then guess what?
The child is coming and I do not know what to do.
Oh, can I vomit in my diaper genie?
No. Honey, you'll be fine.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.
All right.
Now do not worry! Everything will be OK.
it
Hey!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I just made Bamboozled Chandler! That's not a sexual thing. It was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.

Okay, the reason I asked you guys for today's brunch is because I thought about who my bridesmaid should be.
My God! This is! I really hope it's you!
I hope it's you.
Me too!
First of all um, I love you so much and you are both so important to me
Ok, blah-blah-blah-blah !! Who is it?!
Well, I was thinking that maybe we could invent a system in which we exchange the maidens of honor for each other.
As hypothetically, if Phoebe was mine
Yup!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
Yet.
If Phoebe was my maid of honor
Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe, I'd be Rachel, that way we'll all do it once and no one would be angry.
Yes, it's actually a good idea.
Yes I will. So who can be yours?
Well, this is the best part. Umm,
Why is this the best part?
Because then I do not have to!
Good of
I'm not really deciding!
Well!
Yes, that's right.
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a beautiful lady!

If you want to give Joey a Christmas present that upsets the whole building, why not get him something a little thinner, like a wrecking ball or a small vial to release in the hallway?
It is not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
Oh god, my eye! "
I mean, it's so annoying.
Yes thanks. See, this is the way normal people should react to the battery.
Phoebe, do you have Joey's battery to annoy Rachel, so she would not want to live there anymore?
Perhaps at some level.

Joey? Could you have it? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, I'm taking over for our appointment. These are for you.
Oh, lilies. Joey, they're my favorites. Thank you.
And, a biscuit!
Well, a biscuit half.
In reality, it's just a bag.
It was a long walk from the flower shop and I was starting to feel faint like that
Oh God!
Is fantastic!
Actually I feel like I'm going to a real date!
Although, I get a bit of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up around there.
Hey, let's go now, this is a real date.
Uh, so cute place you came here.
Foosball, eh?
Box of pizza
Oh, a subscription to
Yes, it's actually my roommate.
I'd like to meet him. He looks like a boy standing.
Ah yes, but it's very protective of me, so it's better for you to look at yourself.
Hey, so this roommate is nice?
HM-mmm.
Oh yes, it must be hard to hold his hands, huh?
Yes, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
No-no-no-no, it's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!

Can you believe what an idiot Ross was?
Yes I know. It can become really competitive.
Has. Ah, ah.
What?
Oh, bye, kettle? This is Monica. Are you black.
Please! I'm not as bad as Ross.
Oh, I beg to differ. The
That was it
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Well, do not play Raquetball!
He forgot to leave his grip!
He did not have glasses!
Well, it seems like you two have problems.
Goodbye, baby.
Hi, bela.
Are they waiting for me to do this?
So will you tell him?
Why should I tell him?
How about why if you do not, your mother could do it.
Oh...
What are you guys doing here?
Uhhhh .... does not even have a jock!
... What did I ask?

God. I feel violated
Someone else felt that he just wanted to remove the skin from his body, have something else to do?
Ross, at ten.
IS? It feels like two.
No,
What?
There is a beautiful woman at eight, at nine, at ten!
Oh. Hello!
Is fantastic! It makes women seem to dream like low, fat and bald men!
Well, go see her! It is not with anyone.
Oh yes, and what would be my opening line? 'I'm sorry. Blarrglarrghh.
Come on. You are a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she
She could never have a woman like that in a million years.
Thanks friend.
Oh, oh, but you know, you always see these really beautiful women with these guys really nothing, you could be one of those guys.
Could you do it!
Y'think?
OK, it's enough of the sight. Look at it, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
OK.
Is fantastic! Helen, could you come here for a moment?
Thanks Helen, it will be everything.
The last time I do it, I promise.

I'm so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh Huh.
And I'll cook everything you want here, and you'll do anything in there!
Yes, you will do it! And are you kidding me ?!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please, please, please?
All right.
All right.
So, are we going in there?
I'm!!

Wow!
It is actually in the manual.
I can not go out with you or have a hot dish in my office.
I can not believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I appreciate the fact that you defended me. I felt really good. It made me like you even more.
I know, I know that I like you too much. But we ... we can not go out. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Wow!
What?
Just hearing you say it's forbidden, it's very hot.
Really?
Yes.
Well, I_I_I do not care how hot it is-it's wrong.
Stop that!
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's bad. It is a taboo.
Close the book!
We also take a hot dish!

Rachel, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you have a great job! Good friends
Yes! So when are you getting married?
Oh I'm not, I just like to try them.
I do the same thing
I'm kidding. I'm getting married on July 25th
I'm joking too. I will get married in December.
So when are you getting married?
Oh May 15th
Oooh is approaching!
Yes!
So who is your photographer?
Jeffery.
We met with him. Did he show you pictures of the naked marriage he did?
The best man? Wow!
I know! I almost canceled my marriage. Oh, who is your band ?!
Oh, my girlfriend wants the Swing Kings.
Oh, you're so lucky. My girlfriend wants the heavy metal band of Carcass.
Ooh, is it written with a "C" or a "K"? My God! It does not matter; they are both fantastic!
Oh you know what?
You know what?
Now that you know what you want, you should go to Kleinman and put it in half.
This place is so expensive.
So, this comes in another color o

I'm telling you, for years, schoolchildren will study it as one of the biggest first dates of all time.
It was amazing!
We could be totally ourselves, we did not have to play any games ...
So you already called her?
Let her know that I like it?
What are you, crazy?
It's the day after!
How much does it seem necessary to me?
I'm right, right?
Oh yeah. Yes. Let it dangle.
I can not believe my parents pressure me to find any of you.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Which, by the way, is the real treatment of San Francisco. I took his car.
His answering machine?
No, it is interesting to note that its leaf blower has collected.
So, uh, why did not you say anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. The last time I left a spontaneous message, I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Look look! I'm Rachel and Barry. No, do not look at them all at once!
Ok, ok, what's going on?
Ok, they're just talking ...
Yes, well, do you look angry? It seems like he was just told to push something?

So, what do you do for a living?
Well, um, I've worked in the past few years ... which is fun because, that was not even my major.
Oh no I thought you said they could shoot without you.
I thought they could ... I'll try to get back as soon as possible. I'm sorry.
This is fun
Hey, do you think ... would it be too weird if I invited Carol to join us?
Because she is, she is alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
I presume.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Do you want to come and join us?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on.
These people will go down.
You guys will, will you?
Let's try to make the scoop!
Come on.
Come on.
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches the sixth grade.
And Kristin, Kristin ... does something that, oddly enough, was not even her major!

All right.
All right.
When I was six years old.
HM-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel.
Instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken you go around.
It was embarrassing; the children made fun of me.
It was a rather difficult year.
Is fantastic!
To see?
I already feel like getting to know you a little better!
Thank you.
Ok, come on.
Now we can go and eat.
Here we go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!

Choose one, choose one! Here, what about that?
Those are garden furniture!
So, how, people will come in and think, "Uh-oh, are they out again?" Obviously!
And the birds?
I do not know, the birds do not say "Hi, sit here, eat something".
Choose one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so, forget the birds, but the big red bugs suggest a refined cuisine!
Well, you want to catch the birds, catch the birds!
Not so, I will not do it! Kip would have liked the birds!

Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?
Bijan for ... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe, after work, you and I could go, maybe get a cup of coffee.
Oh, I actually have plans.
Hello, Annabelle?
You bet. Maybe another time?
Hey, it's not the first time I've lost a girl for a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!

It was great!
Phoebe and Gary are
It was great.
We are the hottest! Eh?
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
I
Hey guys! What's going on?
Hey, Joey! Is not that the girl who greeted you the other day?
How are you'?

So, what are you going to do?
What can I do? A person wants to break up, you break up.
Hey, no! Come on, guys, call her and solve it.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, I do not have to wait a while?
Hey, it's not like swimming after eating, pick up the phone !!
You know that the whole thing about swimming is a myth.
Yes, tell my Uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, he really believes it.

It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really big this morning.
Well, okay, so what happens now? Go, get the eggs, put us inside.
Ok, it will take some time to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? As in "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five actually.
Five? Ok, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We make five because this gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attack.
That's all! 25 percent? This means that it is like a 75% chance of not having any children!
Hey, you know, I was thinking, what are the chances that if ... if you do stuff like 200 in there?
Sweetie, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Okay, well, you know what, do not worry guys, because I - I'll do it every time I need to do it right.
Well, you see, the - the thing is, we - we just have it, we have a chance to get it right.
Umm, it costs $ 16,000 every time you do it.
So, we're using a little bit of all the money we have to do only this time.
Whoa !! All right, this is a
No, I'm sorry.
Wow! You guys do not really know anything!
I know! Why do not you get drunk! This worked for many girls in my high school.

Sorry. So, how's it going with Joey?
Oh, just great.
He plays me now with the codes.
One is: "Bring me food".
Two is: "I'm with a girl, bring us some food".
Three is: "I'm lost and I can not find food".
Hey! Everything is going well?
Yes! She is right in there!
Oh great. Hey! Go get those pants off, they look ready!

Hey!
Hey!
Do you guys have something to eat? I just went to Johnos for a bit of chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I brought Larry there to eat, but it was all violated. So we turn it off!
Phoebe, if this guy keeps closing all our favorite places, where are we going to eat ?!
I do not know, clean places?
Umm, yum!
It's Danny.
Do not let it in! I should be at a sailing gala.
We'll be right there! Can not you say it starts later?
What? What kind of gala race starts at night?
The false type!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. Do you have a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party.
Ok, great!
Hey, guys, do you know what Larry would say? He said "I'll see you ladle".

You are so efficient. I love you!
Here we go!
No-no-no! We need something old!
Ohh, great, I have a condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
It will work!
I do not think so
Ok, now we just need something borrowed!
Here, take this.
This is stealing!
No, we'll bring it back! Put it under your dress.
Ohh.
Ok, one thing at a time.

I'm sorry for that. So what did you do?
Oh, not much. I ... I have a job.
Oh that's great.
Why are you- why are you so tanned?
Oh, I ... I went to Aruba.
Noooo! I'm lying. I'm so drunk.
Oh God, oh
Great, Monica, you know what, you could have called, I've been up here, I was worried ...
Monica? Monica!
Water rules!
Yes, yes, it does. Ok, look, the restaurant called, they want to know if you want to show up for work?
No. Going to
Ok, Monica, what are you doing? You will lose your job! This is not you!
No it's me!
You know, I'm not just the person who needs to chill the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they arrive!
You know, when I'm with her, I'm much more than that.
I am - I am Monana!
Hello? Yes, she is, wait a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the people on the credit card.
Helloooo? Yes, my God. Thank you.
What?
They arrested Monica.

Note the pictorial lines and the thin dough on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors, since his elusive subject was the light itself.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain thinks of monster truck!
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not written M-O-N-A-Y.
Me only ...
I wrote it phonetically for you.
Phonetically?
Yes, yes, it means ... do you know? We just ... we do not have time for this.
Ok.
Ok, but you know what? I must say that I am really impressed that you managed to memorize all this so fast!
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Wow. What does he do
No idea!
But I told the boy that he will die in the next scene, so I suppose it means "you'll be eaten by a bear".
Ok! So we move on to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No advertisement and guy, you can not
Come on! you...
No!

Oh. Oh, oh.
Hey! What happened to you? Why did not you come?
Done!
Have you just finished?
Well, I wanted to be complete.
I mean this - this is clearly very, very important for you, for us!
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
So, right?
I'm sorry.
It does?
It does? It does? Yes, I wanted to give everything that happened? only another glance starts.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said you read it twice!
Look, you know what, or does it or not, and if you must too
No, Rach, no. Not me, not me, not me
Are you sure?
Oh sure! I'm sure.
I know.

You married again.
Yup.
So this is your second marriage in two years.
Yes, the second in two years. Third in general.
Ross, I've been a divorce attorney for 23 years and I've never had so much work with a client.
Why do not you tell me what happened.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and got drunk
I'm sorry, is it the same Rachel that name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes Yes Yes! But, I - I do
Oh, it's better then.
This was just a drunken mistake and I needed to get it canceled.
I see. Have you considered the therapy?
I just think of the
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Easy.
And we will need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
No problem.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ooh!
There's no way to do it without her?
Because I prepared everything ready, um, it was, it had already been taken care of.
No!
All right.

So, Phoebs owes $ 7.50, Monica, you owe $ 10, and Rachel, you need fifteen big ones.
But hey, thank you for teaching us Mary Cross-Eyed. Guys, we have to play it in our usual game.
Well, here's my $ 7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Oh, I cursed him So bad things will happen to those who spend it.
All right, I'll take it.
The bad things happen to me anyway.
In this way I can break them with a film.
Well, this leaves the big green poker machine, which owes fifteen ...
Ah! Eh?

Do you want to do it now?
Great!
Ok, I just want to be sure this time. Andie McDowell is the girl from
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the type from
Oh yeah. OK thanks.
You are welcome.

it is for me not to see you anymore
This is crazy!
You can not do this!
What are you going to tell her?
Oh God.
Ohh, you already accepted this, right?
It's terrible, I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do it if I want my marriage to work.
And I do it, I have to do
Ohh! Lucky me! My God! what
You have no idea what a nightmare it was. It's so difficult.
Oh yes, really? Is it Ross? Yes? Ok, well, let me make it a little easier for you.
What are you doing?
Soon!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yes, that's how I'm crazy !!

These little women. Wow!
You like it, eh?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I do not see how he can ever forgive her.
Umm, Jo is a girl, is short for Josephine.
Chandler.
Hello.
Hello.
Joey.
Hey-hey!
Hey.
This is Monica.
Whoa!
And this is Rachel.
Hello!
Whoa !!
I'm going to have a coffee.
Hey, how do you do something?
We do not, really.
Well, then, do you guys have a lot of big projects?
Oh yeah! Yes, no, we will connect, you know bond, and everything.
Yes, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and catch some ninja stars.
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a prostitute.
You know, we do not really take advantage of life in the city.
I know.

Ok, Chandler!
All right.
And your horoscope says: "On the fifth, someone special will give you a gift".
Oh, well, thank you in advance.
Op, but the twelfth brings the spasm of a lover.
Oh, wait and the nineteenth secret crush announces.
Hey guys!
Hey !!
My God! I'm Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!!!!!!
Oh this is true. It's your first day! So are you tired of fighting fake crime with your robot buddy?
I'm crazy? The protagonist in my TV series? I've dreamed it for years! Why am I not preparing ?!
No! Joey, you'll be great!
But I had to act with a robot Pheebs and ... and I know nothing about the technology!
I can not even use Chandler's computer except to find porn!
And - and that's just because it's right there when you turn it on!
I think the spasm of our lover will begin a little early this month.
I'll wait.

This is the last minute, so I want to apologize for the mess. All right?
My God! It certainly did not look like this when I lived here.
I know!
Now look, there's only one problem though.
There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay with Joey.
Well, since the fire was a little my fault, I guess you should stay here.
Hey! Hey-hey, now it's nobody's fault, Phoebe. All right? It was an accident.
Well no, it was my fault so you should take the nice room.
All right!
So Rachel!
You are the first guest at the Hotel Monica!
Umm, you just have to tell me how you like eggs in the morning.
And I thought to take them, you know, to bed.
Oh, you've been through so much.
I have.

This is only Bactine. It will not hurt.
Sorry, it was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find its owner.
Why do not we simply put "poor little Tooty" in the hall?
During a blackout? He would have been trampled!
Yes?

Well, I want you to know there may be times when I might not be around like this.
But I will always come back, this way.
And sometimes I could stay away for longer, like this.
But I will always come back, this way.
And sometimes, I want you to steal the third, and I'll go like this.
He is so extraordinary.
Oh I know. Look at him.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Anything. I do not think it's his name.
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
He does not do much, does he?
No, this is practically everything.
Guys, do you want to have a coffee?
Yes.
Okay see you later.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Come on, they'll love you.

Here it is.
My God! This is a six-hour pill! That's all! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
Oh, it's like a huge weight has been lifted!
Why look, no hair loss, no rash, no beehive, I'm so happy!
Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria ... Oh.

Well, thanks for lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I did not pay, I thought you paid!
So apparently we do not pay for food anymore. See what I see?
How did it go?
He had the money in the wrong hand.

All right, I'm going to get my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility to make sure nothing happens?
I will do it.
Who wants it? Anyone?
I said I will do it!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I will do it myself.
Monica! I'm not going to ruin everything!
You know what?
You're right, I'm sorry.
Actually you've been a great help tonight.
Yes, and thank you for putting my grandmother in the cabin and making sure to get to the hotel safely.
Well, of course, this is what I'm here for!
All right. Sorry.
Ugh! What grandma?

Hello. Tag, I have a conference call today is the right one?
Yes, at 4:00.
Okay thank you.
This will be everything.
Wait!
Wait!
Did you see that?
That mail guy had no idea there was anything between us.
You saw my huge pile of porn, right?

Hey Monica, it's Chip.
Yesss !!
Who is Chip?
Shhh!
Well, today I'll take you to the bank, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Call me. After.
Chip, it's Chip Matthews.
The guy who brought Rachel to the dance? Why is he calling you?
Because I ran into him in the bank, he's still so cute.
Monica, you're so lucky! It's like the most popular boy at school !!
I know!! Chip? Hello! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. All right. Ok, goodbye. Oh my God, we just had
I was leaving.
Good! Because I have a report on the product to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I do not fall asleep.
Why? Did you write it?
Wow! Look at that, he called Chip Matthews. I wonder what he wants?
Well, actually ...

Here is your Phoebe tea.

Oh! No, I think I just had a contraction.
What do you?
My God!
I like her. She sees intelligent.

I have no idea, it could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oh alright. It was worth the wait and I do not mean just tonight.
I really
: Yeah, well, your friends are in violation of it.
I've been a good boy so far, but I do not need this pain.
I'll call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegitimately submitting her grandmother's apartment.
Your friends are out of here friend.
Why do not you tell me something I do not know!

All right! I found one that fits!
Well, you know what they say, 23
Whose is it?
Oh does it matter ?! All that matters is that you look so beautiful.
Oh damn!
No! Do not say that! Do not say that!
Damn!
No no! Return to repeat!
Damn!
Oh shit!
Oh shit!

Hey, Rachel! Hey, do you mind if I read my comic books here?
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's pretty hard to concentrate.
What?!
He just called and said he will work late!
She keeps lying to me!
That's all!
You know what?
I'll just go there and I'll deal with them now!
So, Chandler, I ... I'd like to come tonight.
Really?
Oh absolutely. Let's say, around seven?
Yup.
Good. I really can not wait for you and me to have a sexual relationship.
Hey-hey, take a look! Check it out! Ugly naked boy has a naked friend!

Noo! Could be! I do not know.

Excuse me, sir! This lady played my fourth, this is my money.

What do you say if we talk about it during dinner?
Ok lady, you're out of here.
No! No, you can not stop me! No!! I will not come back! I will not be back in that hell hole!
I'm just bringing you out!
Oh ok.

Hey!
Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that might make you want to stay married. We register and
No!
Ross, let's go!
No!
Listen, look, I've been thinking a lot about how to tell you and the bottom line, Ross, we can not stay married.
I do not know if it's true.
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, okay, you know what it is?
Oh Ross, let's go! This is not, this is not a wedding !! This is the worst hangover in the world! Ross, listen, if
All right. Ok I will.
Thank you. Hey, hey, er, is there, is there something like a shower of cancellation?

Hey! What are you guys doing?
Hey.
Make holiday candy for the neighbors.
Yup!
So I will never be able to win again?
How much has he ever really won before?

He's so cute. So where did you grow up guys?
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
How, how could this happen?
My God.
What?
Suddenly I had the feeling of falling. But they are not.

Thank you.
It was very nice Ashley.
No, no.
So, is it my turn now?
I'm next!
Oh!
Evidently they do it.
What?!

Ok, I'm taking a break for this, I go out the window.
No, no, no, no! I was waiting, forever, to go out with Lorraine. Take it easy.
Take it easy? Take it easy? You put me with the woman I downloaded twice in the last five months!
Can you stop screaming? You're making me nervous, and I can not go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go on, come on !!!

Hey guys, guess what?
Are the British coming?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmas. I will be one of those donations for collections of people.
Yes, I already have my bell and later ... I'll take my bucket.
Ohh.
Yes, yes, I will be out there to spread the joy to people.
I mean, last year, I spread a little joy, but not enough.
So this year, I will do the whole city.
You know, I knew a girl in high school did it. She was
I can not
Oh! Look, time is up! My turn!
Was it half an hour?
It's your timer.
You know, I do not like bragging, but I give the
Okay, so massage me well!
Ah! Ahh !! Ahh !!
It's so good, is not it?
It's so nice that I do not know what I did to deserve it!
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Goodbye muscles !!

Oh whoa-whoa-whoa!
Wait a minute, open your hand; let me take a look.
Quarter.
Of me.
Lint?
I do not care.
What is this?
A Canadian coin?
Get out of here!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
No drinks near the bucket!
Set it there and then you can make a contribution!
And you can leave the wounded bunny there too!
Hi Bob!
I thought I told you to get out of here!
Uh, Phoebe complained and we'll move you to a less prestigious place.
Well, because we thought you knew it !! It's so obvious! God, it would be like saying to Monica: "Hey, you like clean things".

Hey, Joe! Do you want to shoot some circles?
Oh no, I can not go. I'm practicing; I auditioned to host a new game.
Oh nice!
Is fantastic.
Yes, yes, and if I have Dr. Drake Remoray by day, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
You'll be perfect for this! This is already your name!
But the audition lasts a couple of hours and I do not even understand the game.
Well, do you want some help?
Oh really? Would be great! You guys can be the competitors!
Awesome!
Ok, I suppose we could lose middle school girls one more time.
All right! Let's play at Bamboozled!
Deceived?
Yes, is not it a nice name?
Yes!
No!
Oh. Ok, breathe.
Oh honey, I think I have one too!
Watch this! Here we are!

I'm sorry. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the section of Paleontology, on the fifth floor, stack 437?
Well ... yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my turn.
No! No!! No! Can I talk to someone in charge, please?
How can I help you?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase safety in the paleontology section?
See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-they're fine, rolling in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
But as for the increase in security, I fear the library is very lacking.
I can not help you.
Very well.
Well!
If, if I am the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I will go there and defend myself!
And do not follow me!

All right. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
My God! Phoebe looks, it's Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look that! It's a line of ants! They are working as a team!
Phoebe!
Right, oh yes
Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking them.
Ugh, I hope you let it go down easily.
Here we go.
Come on, Phoebe, look at that!
They are not melting, look at them.
Ok, this is, you know what it is?
That's a, this is a second date, that's what it is!
Look at it, put your hand on your thigh ...
Oh no! That's really nothing, she is
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he will marry her, and this is all your fault.
You know where I work!
I want it?
The cinema, you always came.
Do you still work at the multiplex?
Oh, as if I had to give up that job! Popcorn and candy for free, whenever I want. I can make you free posters for your room.
Thanks, I'm ready. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh yes, but I can stay out late.

Nice car!
Yes, it's not mine.
I love your car.
Yes it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Me too! Yes. And comfortable. Do you like leather seats?
Yes!
He has them!

Joey, please!
Sorry.
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Hello children!
Hey! Do you want to play table football? Please?
All right.
No-no, no! We have to move the table to my room, yes! For all the boxes. Come on!
All right, I have a question.
Hello bye hand of the puppet Joey?
No, the silent thing!
You mean this.
Um-hmm! Look, I_I_I do not know what else I can take! Did you know that he registered mine
Okay, you know, this maybe hard but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
All right, I think I can hold out a little longer. We play a game.
All right.
No-no-no-no!
YUP!!
Uh guys,
Ok, so it's out of here.
Okay, you know what, because you said it, I will not do it tonight.

I know it does not make much sense
Much
Look Chandler, it was instinct! All right? I just went for this!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the biggest sandwich in the world!
So you did not choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you are like my brother!
Really?!
Yes! In fact, to show what you mean by me here.
Thank you.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is it?
Oh-oi-ho, yes!
To see?
HM-hmm.
Oh-whoa-hey, buddy, what are you doing ?!
I thought you showed me how much you meant to me.
Yes. With a bite! Gee-and-E-ZEE!

Check the ring.
Beautiful! One and a half carats easy.
Hello.
Hey-hey Phoebe!
What?
Chandler will ask Monica to marry him!
Oh I know, I helped choose the ring.
Did you tell her before you told us?
Well, it came in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You understand it, do not you? Guys? Guys?

Let's see.
Congress is discussing a new law on reducing the deficit ... the mayor wants to increase the subway rates again ... the high today was forty-five ... and - oh, the teams have done sport.
What about Glen? It could be a Glen.
Nah ... not-not special enough.
Ooh! What about Agamemnon?
Waaay too special.

Hey, Phoebe!
Hey!
Check it out. How much are a man?!
Wow! Beautiful! Manly is also a kind of slut.
You know, I'm starting to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh Huh.
Silk? It feels really good!
Ah yes, I'm sorry for that.
All right. Come, come in
Thank you for letting me stay here! I mean that Monica's place was nice, but her girlfriend definitely stares a lot.
Oh.
My God! Make a big Chandler!
Uh Huh. Yes, I - I have a talent for impressions.
Well, maybe after we react, you can do me.
Yes No !!

Hey! You guys! Take a look, take a look! Guess which job I had.
I do not know, but Donald Trump wants his black blue blazer.
What?
Blue blazer back. He ... wants it back.
But you, you said black. Why would she want her black blue blazer?
Well, you ... you know what I meant.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
So, what job did you get Joe?
Oh, ah, tourist guide to the museum. Yes, Ross took it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, do not you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
I just walked into the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like a torture!
You know, if we ever go to war and you're caught, you're ready for one
Keep getting worse and worse!
You know?
I mean, it's pretty bad that I'm in love with my roommate partner, which, by the way, I think she knows.
Because every time we are in the room together there is this strange energy between us.
And call me crazy, but I think I like it too.
And now I saw her naked.
I mean, at least, when I saw her in her clothes, I guess her body was covered with holes or something.
But there are no oxen, she is smooth!
Smooth!
Wow! Could everyone see his dress?
Yes! My God!

So, you and Angela, eh?
Yes enough.
Oh, that's what he meant!
You know, if they shorten it, they should call it MUSE!
You know, abbreviation of museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Yes, most is a place
Ok, that's fine, so I'll take it to the MET.
Yes, uh, ok, there's this fantastic bookstore on Madison Avenue.
You know what?
Love architecture, do you know what you should do?
You should take a walk to the fifth St. Patrick's Cathedral and there is this small and small bakery that she would love.
Damn, it seems you should go on this date!
But they are not! . You know what to do if you're in the mood for Thai food ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, go
Ok.
You have to tell me exactly what to do there.
Ok, when you enter the museum, take the right, that is the wing of antiquity.
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I go to the door and do the right thing

Hey!
Hey, so everything was fine with the cancellation?
Oh yes, no problem. It's all right.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you want to go see a movie?
Oh yes, why not?
Phoebe?
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Ok, um, I'll get my sweater.
All right. Do you want to hear something strange?
Always.
I have not received the cancellation.
What?!
We are still married! Do not tell Rachel. See you later.

Hey! Are you OK?
Fabulous.
Listen, critics of the drama are nothing but people who could not make it as actors. Do you know what you should do?
Exactly. So you did not, you did not say anything to Issac, right?
Oh, well, I tell Issac everything.
You say, of course you know. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, bye! You know, we did not actually meet ...
You dog!
Yes, I suppose I'm a dog. But Issac, see I-I happens to have a girlfriend.
Oh, right, Rachel cleans coffee.
Yes it is that. Listen, I do not want to hurt her.
Oh, hey, my friend, no matter how much we love them, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Yes. Listen, can you keep this information for yourself?
Aw, no problem friend. You know, we have to look at each other. We're the same, you and me.
Actually no, we are not.
Yes, we are.
No, we are not.
Yes, we are.
No, we are not!!
Ok, we're not.
Right.
But we are.
Beautiful. I just have to know that you will not tell your sister.
I can promise not to tell him anymore.

Emily!
My God! What are you doing here?
Alone, I had to see you once again before take-off.
You are so sweet.
I mean, this is a big candy bar. (He's holding one of those huge ones
Me too.
Well, that's me. Here, you have this. I'm only allowed a piece of carryon anyway.
Wait, listen.
I - I have to tell you something.
Umm, I was thinking, I'll go out and I'll say it.
All right?
I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Oh. Thank you.
No problem.

Monica!
She is sleeping.
I know, just a quick question, a quick question. Which was
Strong impact
Sorry, I can not sleep.
Ooh!
Where is that book you're reading with the two women who skated and wore ice, wearing those hats with flowers?
Because every time I look at that cover I'm like
It's in the living room where there's even a light! And nobody will kick you in the shin.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking the real estate section
Yes?
Watch this.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house.
Oh, he even has a tree with a broken limb in front of him and uh, the window in the attic is Oh my God!
!
What? What happened to the window in the attic?
I can not believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I can not believe it - they did not even tell us!
I can not believe I do not know what happened to it yet
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the newspaper! Yes, we are surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Sorry!

OK then
Anything?
Look, you and I received a gift.
All right?
We have to do something with this.
Simil-like, manual modeling!
Eh?
O-o magic!
And you
I have to go back to
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa-whoa!
We could have our show!
You know, we could clap together, people will love it!
Eh?
E-e-e I wrote a song for us!
(Singing, for the music of
All right.
But you did not even hear the chorus!

Well, will you understand well? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Dad, he does not care.
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all that is - is growing new things!
See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes you think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh my God, do you really think so?
Well, can you blame her?
Well, I do not know, I suppose we might have subconsciously favored you, you've been a marvel of medicine! The doctor said your mother could do it
Daddy, Daddy, I do not want to hear about it.
Really?
Well, not now.
Okay, Monica came here for some memories and, damn it, we'll give her a little!
Ok, take some empty boxes.
All right?
We'll take from my stuff and anything we can sell like her, we'll put them inside.
Great!
You know, Joey, I could teach you to surf if you want.
Could?
Yes! I have sailed all my life. When I was fifteen my father bought me my boat.
Your boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.

He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Count in our heads just as well
I think I've finished.
The fun is over!
Wait, guys! If, if we follow the rules, it's still fun and means something!
Uh Huh!
I think I'll take the flight.
Guys, the rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!

Japanese spaghetti dehydrated under fluorescent lights ... it does
Question. You're not dating someone, right, because I met someone who would be perfect for you.
Ah, yes, perfect could be a problem. You said "co-dependent" or "self-destructive" ...
Do you want an appointment on Saturday?
Yes thanks.
All right. It's cute, it's fun, it's ...
Is he a him?
Good yes!
...Oh God.
I- only- I thought- Well, Shelley.
Now I'm going to rinse in the toilet ...
Ok, goodbye...

Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Well, let's go to a bad guy and find out.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can slam the rabbit against my back.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey friend. What happens?
Maybe you can tell me.
My agent would like to know why I did not go to the audition I did not know I had today.
The first good thing I get for weeks.
How could you not give me the message?
!
Well, I'll tell you that I like feeling guilty, but, ah, it was not me.
Yes it was! It was him! Uh Huh! Ok, it was me!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.

Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a boy who has a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There's this guy in my class who said he was in love with me.
Whoa!
Whoa what?
Ross has a boyfriend.
I do it
Really?
Yes!
I do not know.
I mean, last year Elizabeth now ... now this guy.
What-what-what-what is it ?!
Am I giving a kind of sexy professor atmosphere?
Not now.
It-it-The point is that my natural charisma made him fail in his interim period.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the baby!
I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
You know, I could not concentrate and blushed every time he looked at me.
I mean, come, you remember what it means to be 19 and in love.
Oh yes! Thanks a lot! Oh, that's - it's actually like the French drink it.

A new pair of Chan-Chan men's shoes! Yup!
Yup! I-I have never seen a roll like this in my life!
It's right, honey! Ok, what do I want now?
All right, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Choose a number! This is yours
8. 8!
Thank you!
If you take it, we all buy a steak dinner here!
Yes, I see.
Take as long as you want.
Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it.
I will be here.
Not smoking.

We'll really do it, eh?
It seems so.
You know if, if this is too weird for you, we can still pull back
I got it!
All right.
Susan! Hello!
Hey!
Thank you very much for coming.
Oh, I would not miss it for the world.
By the way, it's Ross.
Hi Ross. I love what you did with this space.
Thanks a lot.
How hot is it?!

Guess who is here. He's the toughest guy in the toy country, Ben. "A true American hero
G.i. Joe
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects US oil interests from overseas!
It took me 28 years to find a man with whom I want to spend my life, if I had to wait another 28 years then, I will be 56 years before I can have a baby, and this is just stupid.
That's what's stupid.
I do not need a real man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
And there, there are places where you can go and get that stuff.
Back to the dock?

Hello. How many, how many have you sold?
I will not tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Hey, now! It was an accident, okay.
You are a great scruple.
What is a scrub?
Why do not you look in the mirror, scan.
I do not have any too. I can only watch you.
It's okay girls and man. Let's see your final comments. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, very nice.
Not pretty enough.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
So, how were the lasagna?
Really?!
Good.
So you owe me three nice things.
Yes, I thought a lot about you too.
I know.
This whole platonic thing is difficult.
It's a word!
Yes, I think it's better this way. Yes, we are intelligent. Yes I'm sure.
Are you really sure?
I'll call you back.

So, are you really going out with that nurse?
Well, you and I are just joking, I thought, why do not you joke with him.
You know, I do not know if you've ever looked at the term joking in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care about each other and have fantastic sex and just want to spend more time together.
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that you are made to do, then we must, you know, get my original dictionary.
I'm
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? OK then
Know when to stop.
You know, I felt I had to stop. So are we okay?
Yes. All right, I'm going to tell Dan that it will not happen. Do not do the dance
Right!

Ouch! -Ow! -Ow! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! You know, ow!
Hey! Hey! What is going on?
He broke my arm.
He touched my girlfriend.
No, first he touched mine!
It's my job!
Are you English?
No not anymore.
Why are you shopping here? You do not live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Yes, eh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just taking some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party does barley serve?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends are not as sophisticated as yours.
Where's this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Who's the party?
Of a woman
Which woman?
Chelsea.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.
Or you're seeing someone behind me, that would make you the biggest idiot on the planet.
Or you're pretending to see someone, which makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal corridor.
So which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be that guy?

Great story again! The yarns that intertwine you! Woo-hoo-hoo!
You know, actually I-I-I should go.
Oh no-no-no! To remain! To remain! Because you-you should-you-should-stay!
Wow. Oh, I'm really flattered, but I do not feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, it's not-no-no-no!
Did you just hit me?
OK, well, you would not let me finish and I was just ... [Monica takes a step back] Ow. That pain [flicks Monica]
Oh! All right. Now, do not do it!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
OK, now I will kick my ass.
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
I know! I know! I know!
Well, now I'll let it go if they both stop.
Well!
Well!
Here we are. You know what, if we were in jail, you guys would be, like, my whores.
OK friend. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I wear everything you own.
My God!
Watch me! I'm Chandler! I could
Yes.
Wow, it's hot with all these things up.
I, ah, I will not do anything, I do not know, lunge.

Hello.
Hello.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about that first.
I do not need to have a game room.
I mean, when I was a kid, I played only those games because I could not have girls, and now I
Stop Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Really?
Yes! Oh yes!
Ohh.
Listen, we do not have to make a guest room, we can think of something with the room together.
This is a great idea! We can
Totally!
We do not have to invent it now.
Oh good.
Yes, and I'm fine with being a pushover.
Is fantastic. Good for you guys.
I'm not high maintenance!
I'm not a pushover!
Who said you were?
You did it!
Oh, I'm shaky. I will say anything

Ok, I know it sounds really stupid, but I feel like if I can do this, you know, if I can really do my laundry, there's nothing I can not do.
It does not seem stupid.
You know, it's like the first time I had to have dinner alone, after Carol left me?
I'm sorry, it's all the time we have.
Come on Ross ... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Uh-oh, oh-oh, the laundry is over.
It is, it's a song.
The laundry song we sing.
Uh-oh the laundry is over, uh-oh, oh-oh.
Ross, what's the problem?
Nothing nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry is over.
Why are you here?
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had problems last time because apparently we ...
No no no ... I mean,
Oh! Someone is a bit irritable today because they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy dimension.
What!?
This was fun! But I have an invasive vaginal examination to get!
I would like to stay, but I have ... I had a hot date ...
Please go! Let me know if you need a hand!
I think he just fell.

I do not want to be single, okay? I alone ... I alone- I just want to be married again!
And I only want a million dollars!
Rachel ?!
Yes.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I will not let it!
And we're not a couple of suckers!
I heard you, Mugsy!
But look, all these rooms are fine?
You can choose one so I can watch - have a magical and perfect weekend with you.
All right,
Anything! It's over! Damn! This is regularly scheduled!
Can we turn off the TV? All right? We really want to spend the whole weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm intruding on changing fun in all the rooms?
Hey, do not blame me for the wig tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice messenger who had to drag the bags in 10 different rooms?
I do not know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada with half a tank of gas!
Do not talk bad about the dead.
We should spend a romantic weekend together, and ... what's wrong with it?
I just want to watch some TV. what's the problem? Damn, relax mom.
What did you say?
I said: "Damn, relaxed Monnnnn".

You know, maybe it's better never to do it again.
Yes, that's what makes that night special. You know, technically we are still

'Kay!
Can I ask you something?
Uhh, no.
Felicity and me, we're watching
No.
I mean, the giant is five years younger than me, you know, do you think I'll ever get there?
Yup.
Thanks man.
Okay, buddy.
But what about what is taller than me?
I mean, there's no way to make me taller now, you know?
And who knows what science will come in the future, but Chandler, and if I die a man of normal size and without success?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for half an hour.
I know!
He had beef tips, eh?

Goodbye and God accelerates, Hope Brady.

We have minced meat from previously cute cows and turkeys, ew ...
Men are here
Mom, do you relax?
That was 10 blocks from here and, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never have done it.
Mom, come on, stop worrying.
This is a safe road, this is a safe building, there is nothing
Hello.
Hello, hello, can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for Phoebe, do you still live here?
Uh, no, he does not, but I can, I can give you a message.
Great. Uhh, just tell her that her husband was stopped.
What?
Hey, how, how did you do it?

Well, someone.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior college year ... on a pool table.
Whoooaa!
That's my sister.
OK ... my strangest place should be ... the women's room on the second floor of the New York public library.
My God! What were you doing in a library?
Phoebe, and you?
Oh ... Milwaukee.
Um ... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, "It's a Small World After All".
There's no way!
The ride broke.
So, Carol and I went after a couple of those mechanical Dutch children ... then they repaired the route, and we were asked to never return to the Magic Kingdom again.
Oh, Rachel.

Hey!
Hey!
Oh, is the game over?
Yes. Where were you?
Thanks for your patience, you're the next caller.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be crazy.
Nah. I kept busy.
Oh, okay, yes. I put your things in her room and her things in your room.

Well, there is a time. And uh, you know, yesterday.
Yes no, I'm telling you that Rachel has such a nice eye for this stuff.
Ross, you know, if you ever decide you have to repaint ... And I think you should.
You should, you should ask Rachel to help you.
Oh honey, he does not need my help.
Oh come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, how did you call him? The cheap knock-offs and the dinosaur trash.
Really?!
Hey, you know what?
Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here ... here's $ 60, why do not you take Phoebe into your colonial flea market and get me something.
You know what? Not me, I do not think Phoebe really wants to come.
No! I want!
Oh, she wants.
She wants.
Yes!

Wow, you have good feet.
These old things.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadica area, it's killing me today.
You mean siadic-Okay, you mean the towel-covered part.
Yes.
Of course, yes, no, I can do it, yes, because, you know, the muscles in the sdica area can understand it, really beautiful and tight.
So, tell me Rick, how, umm, how did you hurt the area.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Oh.
Ouch! Did you just bite me?
No!

Um, that's it.
No.
Hey!
You!
J.
Crew boy
Yes.
Why did you follow me?
I mean, for the whole week, wherever you look, it's you.
You would not have answered my calls, you sent my letters back ....
What?
One more chance Ursula, please?
All right.

Ok, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Good deal.
Here it is.
Thank you.
Hello!
Hello! All right, let's go shopping !!
Um, you know, before I go ah, there's something I have to say.
Oh ok.
I had a bit of ah, this crush for you.
But since you were with Ross, I-I did not do anything about it.
But now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out.
So-this is-this is what I'm doing now.
Wow! Umm ....
I dropped a cup.

Hello, little embryos.
Well, I'm Phoebe Buffay, bye!
I-I-I hope to be your womb for the next nine months.
You should know that we're doing it for Frank and Alice, you know, you've been there!
Umm, you know that they want you so much, so when you get there, really get it.
Okay, and-and I promise I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to take you home, so Oh!
And then, umm the next time you see me, I'm screaming, do not worry, that's what should happen.
Ready?
Uh Huh. Good luck.

We are baack!
Hey!
What are you guys doing together?
Joey and Janice's
Really.
Yes, yes.
We went to a game of Mets, we got some Chinese food and, you know, I love this woman.
You have a friend of the competition.
I came only to give you a kiss, I have to go get the baby, then.
See you later, honey, Chandler too.
You can not stand it yet, do you?
I'm sorry, man, I'm tired, I did it.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
But look, you know that the good thing is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she.
It was the bat day at Shea Stadium.
You told him to play the gay boxer !!
Well, I could have said Supergay.
You completely screwed him.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Because, Monica, the guy is so good, and I really, I really want this part.
Well, if you really want it, really, then it's okay.

So we have to wait for data from recent MRI scans and DNA tests that challenge information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Look at that woman sitting in the pool to get a tan ... so tough and wrinkled, I'm like that
I'm not your brother.
What about my children Drake? Eh !? No!! No!! No! God!
Because we do not try to massage the breast to stimulate the flow.
Are you kidding me?!
It's so frustrating! Why do not you want my breasts?
I do not know! Maybe she's crazy!

Hi Joey, I got some beer for you.
Uh, do not you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen, I'd order a pizza, would you like to share one?
Pizza, eh, it's not like I've never done it before ... ba dum bum cheshhh.
There is something wrong?
All right, all right, let's get this out in the open ok?
You're hot.
I'm lovable
Clearly there is an atmosphere between us.
But we are roommates and it is a huge mistake for us to continue on this path.
Joey ...
Oh no it is not, no it is not. It's a first date. I'm
Oh.
Oh-oh, it will take some!
From the glow of the lamppost outside his apartment.
You know, he closed the curtains to have a pleasant and pleasant conversation with your little sister.
Well, I'm going to bed!

You were so funny with that waiter! You are crazy!
You know, the fangs of the breadstick are always fun.
No, make them fun. You're the fun one!
Uhh, look at Katie, listen, we have to talk.
All right?
Umm, look, I like you.
I-I really, I like you a lot
All right?
But sometimes when you, when you punch me that way, it seems to me that someone hits me with a very small but very
Aww, as if you could hurt yourself. Are you making fun of my size? Do not make fun of me because of my size!

Oh, Joey! Sorry!
They made you head of the department!
No, I can teach one of his advanced lessons! Why did not I take the department's command?
Oh! Hey, Rach, listen, umm
Yes.
I have an important appointment, do you know a good restaurant?
Uh, Paul's Café. They have great food and it's really romantic.
Ooh, great! Thank you!
Yes! Oh, and then you can take it to the next
Sure, you're naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell you
Ooh, I miss going out.
We all go well dressed and go to a luxury restaurant.
I will not be able to do it for so long, and it's so fun!
I mean it's not fun sitting at home and worrying about giving birth to a sixteen-pound baby.
Hey, you know what?
Eh?
Why do not I take you?
What?! Joey, you do not want to go out with a pregnant lady.
Sure!
And we will go out, we will have fun, and we will keep you out of childbirth and from caesareans and giant heads that stretch out
All right! I'm coming with you! I will go! I will come with you
I'll be fun
All right?

Hello!
Hey!
Joey, I have to tell you, I was thinking
Oh, you know, the script is good, and the director is good, and ... and my co-star is good
God, you must tell me what happens tomorrow!
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! Want to read the lines with me?
Myself? Oh, no, I'm not an actress.
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Oh, fuck it, that part is mine!
Right ... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
All right. . Hi Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
I can not believe you married him.
But what choice I had. He was holding my sister in one
So, and we? Everything we feel for each other.
It's over! you
How can I?
Knowing that I will never hold you in my arms, I will not touch your skin, nor will I feel your lips, knowing that I will never make love with you?
How can I accept that ...
I will never be able to kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you now.
Kiss Me.
What?

Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you have the biggest half. What did you want?
The biggest half.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Brindo here, ding ding.
I know this is not the kind of Thanksgiving you all planned, but it was really great for me, I know, I think because it did not involve the divorce or the projectile vomit.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you had gone to Vail, and if you had been with your family, if you did not have syphilis and stuff like that, we would not all be together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very grateful that all your thanks have been sucked.
It's so sweet.
Hey, here's a bad Christmas.
And a lousy new year.
Here here!

Now wait!
Hold on!
Look, look, your daughter and I should leave for our honeymoon tonight, now-now you-you say I'll be at that airport and I hope she'll be there too!
Oh yes, I said Rachel's name, but it did not mean anything, okay?
She is ... she's just a friend and that's it!
That's all!
Now tell Emily that I love her and that I can not imagine spending my life with anyone else.
Please promise me that you will tell it.
All right, I'll tell him. Come and make a bugger face!
Call me.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, because you never leave the bloody window!

What happened?!!
Well, I do not know!
We fell asleep! That's all.
Yes. Yes. Yes. All right, well, I'd better go.
I think it would be better.
Yes. All right, I'll talk to you later.
All right. But not on this!
No! Never! Never! Hello.
Do not touch! Do not touch!

Umm lady, do you have a minute? I have bad news. I do not think I can transfer to Tulsa.
What?
It's a funny story, actually.
I fell asleep during the meeting this morning, so when I said I would move to Tulsa, I did not really know what I was saying.
You fell asleep?
But just because I've been up all night worried about this meeting, is not it fun?
Irony?
Not a fan, all right.
See, here's the thing.
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she will not go.
See, I love Tulsa!
Tulsa is heaven!
Tulsa is Italy, please do not let me go there!
Chandler, I ...
No no no!
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
Why, why should I call you Elaine?
Oh what a beautiful picture of your son, holding up!
This is a picture of your daughter, it's not like that, well, it's adorable.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.
I'll call you from Tulsa.

Hello.
Hey.
How are you?
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue is my color. How did you know I was here?
Because ... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card that you were using.
Which I did not expect.
I want you to know, I did not let you in.
Oh. Thank you.
No thanks! You gave me so much! I mean, if it were not for you, I would never have sung
Well, actually, you just sang "Memo".
I can not believe you're here.
I mean, what will I do without you?
Who will make the embassy parties collapse with me?
Who will take me to the
Uh ... Oh, Mindy, you're so stupid. Oh, we're both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Family smell?
Oh no
Oh, I'm so sorry.
No, I'm so sorry ...
Oh my.

Well, I have no way to give it a try.
Maybe they can take the needle and stick it in your mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Doctor, can I see you for a minute, please? My brother has a slight phobia on needles.
Did you tell him about my idea of ​​the thquirt pistol?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there is a way to treat it orally.
No, in these circumstances it must be an injection, and it must be now.
Tho?
Ohhh.
All right, sit down.
The doctor says it must be a needle.
You just have to be brave, okay?
Can you do it for me?
Ok.
Ok. Oh boy. You're doing so well. Do you want to squeeze my hand?
Yup!
All right.
All right, Ross, do not hold it so tight.
Honey, really, do not squeeze that much!
Oh, Ross!
Let my hand go!

You'll love me so much I got tickets for Sting !!
My God! I love you! How did you do?!
Well let's say
Oo, where are the seats?
Uh, middle balcony.
You're a bad old woman.
No! Wait no! Shut up, I mean do not cry! Let me have my checkbook!
Look, baby, you do not have to do it, okay?
It's the strength you have inside that means more to me.
You are loyal, you are honest and you have integrity!
This is the kind of strength I want in the man I love!
This does not mean anything to me. Come on!

Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
: Hey.
: What are you doing?
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It is a bit old but
: No! You're clogging up the chute I've spent a half-hour detox!
I'm sorry. I have not ... I do not come here very much.
: Oh yes, of course not!
No.
: Because you're a little princess! "Dad, buy me a pizza, dad, buy a candy factory, dad, make the cast
I have never said that.
: You think you could mess and the big man in coveralls will come in and clean it, eh?
Well, why not think about someone else for a change?
Ok I'm sorry.
Hello!
What is this?
Oh, just that girl's phone number.
Yes, yes, here it is, just a phone number that gave me a very sexy girl.
It's not a big deal, I mean, it's your home phone number, but ... Whoa!
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
Yes, the beautiful Amanda gives me her number and I - I'm going to let it go.
Thank you.

I do not know how any of these has been opened ?!
Did you open them all?
I know! I know! I'm a terrible person! I mean, Chandler will never trust anything with me again!
Oh hey! You have the gift of my parents!
Yes. What is that?
Well, I do not know. I think I do something for salami.
Hey! How did it go?
Yes. What-what did Tag say?
Tag is not the father! And does Joey know now?
I'm Rachel. I know, and I'm so happy for you.
Oh wow, you did not even try to unplug my bra!
So will you ever say who it is?
No, I will. I'm not up to tonight.
Hey Rach, listen, no matter what this guy says, I want you to know that you will not be alone in this.
I'm not?
Listen, I'm a scary world, especially if you're a single mother.
You know, I've always felt that you and I have this ... a special bond.
You know?
So, Rachel Green, will you marry me?
Thank you.
If I can not have it you can not have it!

I can not believe it, you know, it's just ... it's so typical.
Now Monica, I know you're angry, but do not forget.
There will be a wedding, you are about to launch the bouquet, and
Paris?
We will take a moonlight walk in the Rue de la.
Keep talking.
Then we'll sprinkle the pink pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
I love you!

Yup!
I win again!
Ha-ha!
It's like $ 500 you owe me!
Whoo-ho-hoo!
$ 500 which is a loooot of electricity!
Whoo-ho-ho!
I have to buy some food.
Ok, give me a chance to win my money back. All right? Sudden death, a goal, $ 1,000.
Are you serious?
Oh yes!
Ok, get ready to have me!
All right.
Ok, here we are. Ready?
No! No! No! Nobody can beat me.
To see? Now, that's why only fake little men should be kicked.

Who is that?!
Do not worry, I'm brave!
I am brave!
I am brave!
No-no-no-no !!
Can you tell me who is there please?
Hello!
Hello. Do you know what time it is?
It's candy time! My roommate says they taste like little drops of paradise.
Oh please! Did you hear it? Small drops of paradise.
4:00 AM.
So, can I get some candy?
I'm sorry, but some of us must
Umm, listen, I'm sorry, but first I'll put something out in the morning.
All right, I'll go later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.
Mm! It seems I would have remembered you!
Mm! Night Gar '!

Aaron! You must let me go. The boy is hammered!
I'm sorry, Joey, as long as he's here and he's aware that we're still shooting.
Do you happen to have a very large fork?
So, I just talked to the director. That's all, we ended up for the day.
Well, did we finish the scene?
Yes! You've been wonderful.
As you were.
So I took your car, it's right outside.
Why? We finished for the day?
This is what you told me.
Oh thanks. You are welcome.
No-no-no! We have to go! Come on! Here we are.
Is it my ass?

What about these? These seem equal?
Definitely!
Not like each other!
Oh, then no.
Hey!
Hello!
Are you ready?
Yes.
You look amazing. I am the luckiest man in the world.
Oh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Show me the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings
They look good! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend has really good taste!
Thank you for choosing the earrings man.
HM-mmm.

I know there's no hole there, I really liked that picture.
My God! Watch this!
Ok, but there
I do not care! The threads are loose in your head!
I just thought that if I could follow the thread I could find out what he did.
And you ?!
No. Disappear behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought he had gone downstairs.
But it was not so. Greet Mrs. Chatracus.
My God.
Hi dear.
Hi, Mrs. Chatracus.

Ok, are all clear? We will take it and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We will do it
Ross, I really do not think so
Lift!! And slide!
Ok, here we are.
All right, get up! And slide !!

All right, Carl, we're next. Now remember, what will not be?
Another
Quite right! And what will you not do?
Well, I will not talk because
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but
Oh my God, I understand.
I - I'm so sorry, I go.
Goodbye Monica, I wish you a happy life with him.
Chandler, you call me when this enters the cop.

Yes?
I found my twin identical to one hand!
Ohh, you are
No!
But she has just arrived here!
That was Joey!
I wonder where she is. It's so strange
Yeah, well, he's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop it?
Want to know the first thing he said when he returned from his lunch with Richard?
He felt nothing for him.
She loves You!
Really?
Yup! Now, he feels terrible! She really wants to wear makeup! You must find it.
All right.
Good. I really should start wearing hats!

I mean, why should I let him meet?
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all on him.
I mean, they're like coyotes, taking the weak members of the herd.
Listen.
As someone who has seen more than his good dose of bad beef, I'll tell you: it's not such a terrible thing.
I mean, they're your friends, they're just hunting you.
I know. I only hope that once, I would bring home a boy whom they really liked.
Well, you realize that the chances of this happening are a little thinner if they can not meet the guy.

No-no-no-no. Hey!
Anyway, I should go. OK Bye.
Hey honey.
Hi sweetie. So, what was that whispering?
I can not tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people should not have secrets from each other. We have too much love and respect for each other.
Awww. But still not.
No, I'm serious, we should tell each other
Really? Okay, so why do not you tell me what happened to Ross Junior a
Oh no-no, I can not do it.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
All right.
All right.
So, Ross and I are going
My God. Did he vomit?
No, he visited a small town south of throwing up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson of Phoebe's old massage center gets fired.
That's all?! I gave up on mine
Quite right! Lose the sucker !! Please, however, marry me.

Ahhh! Ooh nice!
My God!
Oh hey! How was your audition?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just making you explode because I'll become a great movie star!
Oh! You got it right?!
Well no, not yet. But the audition went really well.
What was it for?
Oh, it's this big budget movie about these three Italian brothers who arrive in America towards the end of the century.
It's really classy!
Oh, and the director should be the next Martin Scorcese.
The next one?
Yes, there's this guy from Chicago who should be the next Martin Scorcese, all right?
But then this guy is right behind him.
Hello!
They loved me!
My God!
Are you kidding me? I've never rented a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay, let me call you back.
What's up?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Wow!
I know! My grandma will see this!
Grandma will have to get in line.

Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
What? Of course I did it! You are sitting near Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
Oh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I had a nickname.
As if the boy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh yeah. So, do you have a nickname for me?
Umm, no. No.
Yes, you did it! What was that?
Umm, I'm Cutie McPretty.
Ohh it's so sweet!
Listen, I have to tell you, I'm enjoying a world!
You know how you said it could be weird, the whole thing about the student teacher, and to be honest, I thought it would be too much, but it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Burt!

Ok, so we got other good waste, many things to work on.
Ok, shoot.
Ok, oh, the zoo spot.
I did not get it?
No. They said that "I was not credible as a human being". So, you can work on it.
Ok, what else?
Um, the off-Broadway theater people said, "You were pretty but stupid."
Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, it's 'pretty stupid'.
Hey.
How's the maniac?
Oh, well, it's very good. We had a little kiss.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's no longer involved in that stuff. He left for me.
Phoebe, this guy was obsessed with your sister, who knows how long, okay, do not give up.
Look, he gave me his night vision glasses and everything.
Are you taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
What, he is not following her yet. Do you think he's still following her?
Phoebe, wake up and smell the restraining order.
What are you saying I should do?
I think if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thanks, Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Oh, that's what I would do, I'll forget mine.

Hi guys, take a look! My mother sent me the paper!
Ooh, let's see!
Ahhh.
Ah!
Are not you crazy, are you?
No.
So what's up?

There he is!
There is our star!
So, then, what did you think?
Almost as perfect as the one with the two naked girls on the swing.
I-I was not in that.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian woman who lives in mine.
So you know?
The postman was downstairs, so I contacted your mail.
Oh good. Thank you.
Now what is Fabutec?
Ok, okay, do not judge me too much.
All right?
Um, but I've seen this info-merciale, and, um, I swear to you that I've never bought anything on TV before, except for this rag.
But there was this stuff on the waxing of the legs, simply, it seemed so incredible ....
Waxine !!
Yup! Have you seen it?
Oh, it's incredible! I really want to be a Waxine girl.
I know!!
God. Do you really think it does not hurt? Why how can they do it?
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rainforest!
They have the best things in there.

Comin through. Move, move.
Oh, 'excuse me. I was using that car.
Yes, well, now you're not a bit.
But I saved it. I put my trash can on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, is it your basket? It's really pretty Unfortunately, I do not see foam.
What?
No suds, no rescue. Ok?
What is happening?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my car.
Was your basket at the top?
Yes, but there was no foam.
So?
Well, you know, no water, no hello.
No foam? Excuse me, wait a minute. This is my friend's car.
Hey, hey, hey, his stuff did not fit.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Because it's a good price! But this does not change the fact that it is an evil bloodsucker!
Well, I think this is a great place to work!
Ok, are they listening?

Varrrrrroom!
Hey!
Look at you lady!
Varrrrrrrrrrom!
Hey-hey, look good!
Varrrrrrrrroom.
All right, I'm leaving.
My bed is so boring.

Ross you realize that this is the first time in my life that I'm doing something that I really care about.
This is the first time in my life that I'm doing something I'm really good at.
I mean.
if you do not get it ...
No, bye, I got it, okay, I had that great moment.
And I'm happy for you, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your voice mail!
Ok, I do not know what to do anymore.
Well, me too!
Hey!
I'm sorry, I'm late, I missed something?
Joey stuffing 15
15? Your personal best! (Ross takes one
Where were you?
Oh, on an appointment. Yes, I met this girl on the train going to a museum in the north of the state.
Oh yeah! How did you meet her?
Oh, what museum?
No, answer to his.
Ok, it was just me and her on the back of the train, and I sat by the door, so she would have to pass by me if she wanted to change the car.
He was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were drooling this woman?
No, I'm coming back because he lives in Poughkeepsie.
It sounds really fantastic, but it's absolutely fantastic, but it's two and a half hours away.
How can it be great if it comes from Poughkeepsie? That joke would kill Albany.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?

No, there's no way! can he
Because it's your family
He can not play at our wedding!
I mean, everyone will leave!
I mean, come on, it's just noise!
It's not even a song!
If you listen very carefully, I think it is

Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
So you think these images ... Are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, sure, of course.
I mean, as in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she is screaming, 'Where am I, where am I?'
Well, he will not find them lying on the grass like that.
Oh yeah. Aw, do you remember the days when you went to the barn, did you get up on your shirt and bend?
Yes.
See, now, go out with this girl.
She's pretty, she's in the open air, you know, and she knows how to light a fire.
I mean, this must come in handy
Ok, I have a question. If I had to choose one of us to date, who would it be?
I do not know.
Me neither.
Rachele.
What?!
I do not know. Me neither.

Look, I wanted to tell you that ... I'm sorry you lost.
Listen, I have a secret for you. I let him win.
It's a secret or a lie.
No, I let him win, Ross!
Yes?
Would you tell her I let you win, please?
Oh. Yes. Uh Chandler
I am strong! I'll show you!
Chandler please!
Oh what is it? You are scared?
Let's go big bunny!
All right. 1 2 3-Go! I will kill myself!

Hey, Ross, is Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh, that's why they call him Staten
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Wow! Do you realize that we threw this ball without letting it fall for an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yes. I realized about half an hour ago, but I did not want to say anything because I did not want to unlucky him.
Wow! We're pretty good at this! Hey! We completely forgot lunch!
Oh, me-I think it's the first time I miss a meal! Yes, my pants are a bit loose!
Hey guys
Hey!

Who is it?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey!
Oh God. So, you're making porn movies.
No I'm not.
You're doing one now!
IS-
Yes, can I help you with something?
Look, I'm talking right now! You ... you mean her.
You know, twin things are always a great seller.
What?!
Yes, I can talk to you to give you 30 dollars.
No!!
There's no way!
No!
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!
And shame on all of you!
You're disgusting!
Above all with you!

Hey!
Hi Phoebe!
Are you going out?
No, these are not all my bags. This is from Paul.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a second?
Well, of course ... just a second, though, because Paul is coming.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Phoebe, Phoebe ...
Ok, we have not known each other for a long time and ... there are three things you should know about me.
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best raisin cookies in the world.
Ok, thank you Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted them before ?!
Oh, I do not do them a lot because I do not think it's right for the other cookies
All right, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which shows that I never lie down.
I guess you do not do it.
Paolo made me a passage.

I'm so sorry. Please stop going crazy.
I'm not going crazy.
Why should I be out of my mind?
A woman named Heldi called and said we would get married, but this happens every day.
Honey, we were in this beautiful place, and I_I_I put down our names for fun!
I mean, what's the damage in this?
Right here!
Chandler, please do not think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
Phoebe and Rachel!
So the people who knew our marriage before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some bands called Starlight Magic 7 that are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please do not take this to say anything, because it does not.
All right.
Really?
Yes, if it really does not mean anything, because you know I'm not ready
I know! I know.
All right.
I'm going to tell Joey that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Hey, did you buy it?
Totally.
So Heldi showed you the place?
Yes, it's beautiful.
I can not believe you'll ask Monica to marry you!
I know.

No Phoebe!
You can not take the phone like that; it's not right!
Okay, I have an idea.
Because we do not do it, because we do not see what kind of number it has on its speed dial, and from that moment we can say who has more in common with him.
And then who takes the phone.
Or, we can decide based on the name that is never closer to the word phone.
I do not think so
All right, but I bet you'd be singing another song if we were arguing over a ratchet.
All right, the name on the speed dial is mom.
Oh, I lost my mother for suicide.
Okay, no, you can not use it to get the cute boy and the last blueberry muffin.
Have I used it today? I'm sorry.
Yes it's okay.
Well, now you see this is not telling us anything.
Joe.
Carlos.
Peter.
Ooh!
Peter Luger!
It's a steak house!
Ok, a meat eater. Well, this is for you.
Oh, I win! He has
So you do not know it
His new girlfriend!

I can not believe. Do you think your parents could help pay for this?
I do not know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth marriage.
He's saving the rest for his divorce.
And all the extra money my father has for his annual trips
Well, what happened to dinner?
My parents spent the money on our wedding!
My God! What did you order ?!
Wait, but there is no money! Well, this is terrible! You guys should marry you like a, rec. center!
Darling you'll be okay.
No! No it is not! It will not be good! It sucks! No swing band! No lily!
No, you know what?
It'll be fine.
I mean you do not have to have this rustic Italian party.
You know?
And-and you do not need, you do not need this tailor-made, imperious life, duchess, satin dress; you can wear the rack.

Dr. Geller, there is a place here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having lunch at this table here in the middle.
I'm having lunch here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
You know, we work in a museum of natural history, yet there is something unnatural about the way we have lunch.
Now, I look around in this cafe, and you know what I see, I see - I see a division.
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself: "My God why?"
Now, I say we release them - these coats that separate us, and we know the people below.
I'm Ross!
I'm divorced and I have a baby!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I do not know the dinosaur squat!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
All right, here you are!
Yes, you stayed in Teddy!
I'm Andrew, and I have not paid for this pear.
All right, good for you.
I'm Rhonda, and these are not real!
Wow, Rhonda.
I'm Scott.
Yes, ok, Scott!
And I need to turn the light switch on and off 17 times before leaving a room or my family will die.

So thanks for the warm welcome.
It's nice to have guys on my team and I come to play.
I hope you do it too.
Now, let's go out there and get them!
Eh?
And remember, there is no "I" in the team.
Yes, but there are two in martinis, so everyone
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Oh, it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry, I was just ah ...
No-no, I heard what you said, funny.
I like fun
This team talks about hard work, but it's also about having fun.
It's nice to have you on Bing!

Yes. You will not be able to take it.
So, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what will they call her?
They will call her Chandler.
It's a masculine name, do not you think?
It works on you.

Oh, it's so sweet.
No, no, ok, hang up.
Ok, ok, one, two, three.
Well, you did not even hang up.
She did not hang up too ...
Ok, no, no, hang up. You, you, you
Ross, hi, I'm Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that um, everything is fine and I'm really happy for you and yours
Rachel, I received a message from you.
My God.
Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.
.
.
Are you on top of me?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
What ... are you, are you, are you above me?
Ohh, ohh.
When, when were you ... under me?
Well, basically, lately, I've got a kind of feeling for you.
OK, I need to lie down

Hey! I'm in, they'll let me audition!
Really? Is fantastic!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting women saw me in a comedy, so I moved away from her
(noting a child who has collected a copy of
Oh yes, yes! He did a lot of publicity. I saw it as Sugar Smacks,
Yes, well, he will not take it
Ben is so much nicer than that guy.
I mean look at it, look at it,
Is fantastic. Listen, would not it be nice if I could play Ben's father?
Joey, do not look like Ben.
I look more like him than you!
You know, I do not know you well enough for you to do it.

This was really your best job.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can not believe I have only two hours before you call sick for work.
I have to be awake in seven minutes.
Well, you will not believe it, but if you have seven minutes
Really?!
Do you want?
All right! Get the vacuum cleaner and I receive the furniture polish!

Oh ok. But you know what? Watch out. Because a guy who was helping me first had to leave because he hurt his back.
Fiance?
No.
I'm Joey.
Kristen.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! Again?
Kristen.
Done! So
So, do you live around here?
Yes!
Yes!
Right over there.
Hey listen; let me give you a little advice
Do not take a nap like this or you can wake up with the missing shoes.
I will remember it.
All right. Yes. Listen, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
What about tomorrow?
It looks fantastic! Ok, all right, well, where are you going?
You are strong, because I do not take it and take one of the boxes.
All right. Yes. Yes, I will take this.

Hey.
Listen, um ...
I'm sorry.
: Yeah, uh ... You know, you should just forget what I said under the bridge, I was talking
That's right, I do not ... But I was, I was drunk of you!
Ok, yes, so it will not work.
If it were, will you stop going out with her?
Er, so yes, it's because of Phoebe! So, you know, it's her or me.
You know ... You'll really be very difficult to overcome.

By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see many of me.
Oh, hello liar.
Look, I ... I'm really sorry for letting my bike go.
I could be killed, I hope you know!
I know. I know. But can we try again? Eh? I mean, you were
Well, I'd like to but the bike was stolen and the police have no suspicions.
Phoebe.
What?! What the hell?!
All right, you know what?
If you do not learn to ride this bike, I'm sorry, I'll have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
Why! Because, it's - it's like you had this guitar and - and I never played it. Ok, this guitar
All right. If you care enough to recover that shitload, okay.
Great! Great! You are making the bike very happy.
Ok, Ross! Please do not die!

How could you keep all this from me?
I was about to tell you, but
But what?! You thought you'd get what you wanted and then you downloaded it as you downloaded Rachel!
Hey! I did not download Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just because we do not let the car do it?
Hey, Ross. It's Joey. There's a prostitute here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need, I need to lie down.

Everything about your application looks really good-Ohh!
Just one last question, you and your friends will go here all the time like partying and going out?
Oh, do not worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa !! Now look, do not be just angry. I want you to really think about your answers. All right?
You can call the roommate's search! Hello! I will live here.
Oh, do not listen to him, he's just a guy who really wants the apartment, but I do not think he'll understand that.
Why did you lower the shower curtain?
That thing was dangerous! I am very attentive to safety.

Hello.
Hey buddy, how did the audition go?
Estelle said I did not understand it.
What?! Why? Joey, you were so ready for this!
Yes, I thought so too, but you said that the casting members had some trouble with me.
No!
As far as I know, he's trying to find me, but I could not because I kept moving.
No, from now on, I'll stay in one place.
Right here.
Well, it's getting late.
Yes, we will go.
In fact, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Uh, you know, we have to get up early and get that plane to New York.
Yes, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
But we will stay here with you.
Thank you guys! I appreciate it a lot, you know, but you do not have to rub my ass.

Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
I'm not a couple!
Oh, ok, I have the game now.
Ok look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it really hot?
Oh yeah!
All right, so you're fine.
The rule is when two actors are making him off stage, all the sexual tensions between them are gone.
All right?
So as long as it's hot on stage you have nothing to worry about.
It's when the heat goes out, it's when you're in trouble.
Really?
Listen, you guys have been to every opera I've ever been to, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
No.
Noooo !!

Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. OK Bye Bye
Wait a second! So, what's new with you?
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.
And your breasts! Hmm !!!
All right.
Umm, you're getting a bit strong.
But I will give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems that the universe really wants to be together.
So, why do not we start all over again?
And you can only tell me about you.
All right.
All right.
I write erotic novels for children.
What?!
They are wildly unpopular.
My God!
Oh, you might be interested in knowing I have a Ph.D.
Wow! You do?
Yes, a lot 'huge
All right.

So, how are you?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How are you mum?
Myself? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ... What are your hair?
What?
What's different?
Anything.
Oh, maybe that's it.
It's incredible, our mother is ...
Ok, relax, relax.
We'll be here for a while, it seems, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh God!
The small mind blurred at the bottom of the bag.
Oh!
... Yes, they were disgusting.
Oh, do you know what I loved?
His sweet 'n' Los.
As he was always stealing from restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from our home.
Could be.
You can not!
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word you said.
In the room.

Now, you, most people, when their pets pass, want them to be as if they were sleeping.
But sometimes you get your person who wants them posing.
Like, chasing the tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I want to look for my keys.
That's a good one!
Hey, Joe.
Dad, Ronni is here.
Eh?

So now, these are all the tuxedos we create and if there's anything you like, we can make a deal.
Just nothing.
But these are the three that Monica has pre-approved.
Well, thank you very much for keeping me company. I want you to know that I want you to participate in our marriage as my guest.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. All right? Do not try to pin blue me!

Oh, here, I think it's us. Yes.
Limited to sit in my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hello!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know about the bride and groom?
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I have not been invited! A
Stop saying "Blood" to strangers.
So, and you? How do you know the happy couple?
Ok, you're fine.

Monica, why did you bring me here from all the places?
You will see.
I tell you, this marriage will not happen.
Oh God.
All right? But ... but imagine many more lights, ok? And you know less bricks, and-and-and flowers and candles
And the musicians, look, they can go here, okay? And the chairs can handle this way, and you go.
But, if you do not love him, we'll do it anywhere else at any other time.
Really, all right, whatever you want.
It's perfect.
And, I do not know, if it starts to rain
Well, then we'll get wet.
Ohh. And I do not even have an appointment.

Coming.
I have a bone to choose with you.
Uh Oh.
Yup! Ben has learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? He pulled the old man
Quite right! Quite right!
Oh that.
Yes! You know I hate practical jokes! They are bad and they are stupid and I do not want my child to learn them!
You know what? It does not matter! Because it's not true!
All right.
And if it were true, how
Mrs. Monroe Oh, here you are.

Mark is a genius!
Why?! Such as?! How is a genius?
Look, you do not understand what's going on here.
Instead of beating her right away, she is becoming her confidant.
Now it will be the guy who goes to complain about you too.
What am I going to do?
Well, why do not you send her a musical bug, op, you have not already.
All right, you have to go to you now, okay, take a surprise visit.
I do not know you guys.
All right, do not do anything, sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she's talking to you about you.
And it's Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because she understands me.'
And before you know it, she's with him.
And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
And he will be everything, 'Yes!'
And we, we will be like "Wh-whoa, friend".
And very soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii', and, and, and, 'I can not go, Rachel and Mark could be there.'
And we'll be like, 'Man recovers, it's been four years!'
He rather paints a picture, does not he?

This is what I have done so far for the party, wise liquor. Take a lot of liquor.
Great. Great.
Okay, now, as far as the list of invitations is concerned, I've got you, Chandler and me, and I'll invite Gunther because, well, we've talked about this pretty hard.
I will be there.
All right, oh!
Listen, I know this is your party, but I really would like the number of museum buffs there will be.
Yes. Tell me what, we do not invite any of the anthropologists, just the dinosaur guys!
All right! We'll need a six-piece package
Hi guys, what are you doing?
Hey, you know what, if you do, if you call him Joey, you should call him Chandler.
Oh come on!
Chandler is fun, sophisticated, and he's very lovable, once you know him.
Oh well, hey, Joey is lovely too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, well, it might be a bit late, but ... but it will be there.
And it will bring you some cold soda, if you want me to need it, you're really hot.
What do you say? What do you say?
Well, I like the idea of ​​naming him as someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are big names.
But, alright, not ... maybe I'll just call him Hulk.
I knew I should not have said it! This is what I wanted to call my son!

What Rachel did to his life ... We ran into his parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I will not tell you what they spent on that wedding ... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least you had the chance to leave a man at the altar ...
What should it mean?
Anything! It is an expression
No it is not.
Do not listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you've always been!
Even when you were a child ... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were fine!
And you will read alone in your room, and your riddles ...

PBS Telethon.
Hi Joey.
Hey, Phoebe!
I
$ 200? Are you sure about Phoebe? I mean, after what
Oh, I'm still angry with them but even now that they bring happiness to so many children that mothers do not kill themselves, so supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
What kind of problem?
Well, to tell you the truth, they had a problem with the bag!
My God!
Nooooo!
You know what? It was still a stupid comedy!
You know, Joey, I think it's time to leave the bag.
I do not want to give up the bag.
I do not have to give up the bag!
I'm doing Rach?
Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey, wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean it as terrifying as I think you're with it
Oh hey!
I do not know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can not believe I hear it!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I'm not saying you should not have a bag, just ... there are other bags that are a little less humble, controversial.
Yes, they are called portfolios.

I think you will find this room more to your liking.
Ok, fantastic.
They say that only half a tank remained.
Half tank? We still have a lot of high-speed pursuits to do!
We are changing rooms.
What? Why?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Our last room with an ocean view was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you here for a second?
Uh Huh.
Chandler!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey !!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey !!
Oh. Oh, really ... did I wake you up?

Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was going to leave. I-I-I-I did not think you were coming.
Oh, do not lose this.
Well, I'm very happy you're here.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my house!

Hey!
Hey-hey.
So are the boys okay?
Yes, we talked and Monica made me realize that I reacted a bit and some things in life are more important.
Do you have a minute?
Well yes, of course, what's up?
I was invited twice today when I was at lunch as a child.
Oh really?!
Yes. Did you tell anyone I was gay?
Oh, did not you want people to know?
But I'm not gay. And above all I would not want you to think I was gay.
Why?
I do not think I should say.
Oh, you can say. Come on, I do not want you to feel that you can not tell me things.
All right.
'Kay.
Well
Yes.
I'd like to ask your friend Phoebe.
Yes, he's gay.

Here it is.
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Great!
Hey Hey Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. We'll go out tonight.
Go out, eh? Wow! Wow! So things did not work with Kathy, eh? Bummer.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having dinner with her tonight, right after my first dinner with Casey.
What?
Yes, yes. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza alone!
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Yes. Why are you getting so angry?
Well, I'm angry for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be really unsatisfactory for you.
what's the problem? It's not that we are exclusive.
Listen, Joey, Kathy clearly does not meet your emotional needs.
But Casey, I mean I just saw the back of her head, but I got the feeling she's ... she's smart, and funny, and she takes you.
Do you have all this from the back of your head?
Ok, I think it's time for you to settle down. You know? Make a choice, choose a lane.
Who is Elaine?

Can you not see me?
So, will you talk to him?
I do not know Rach.
Oh come on! I'll give you ten for free
One! No ten! You said ten! You can not take it back!

Hey!
Hello!
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your TV?
We need a porn break.
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Well, then, why do not you turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off porn for free.
Ooh, well, you heard! All right.
Hey!
Hello!
Well, what? Has Cha arrived there?
Oh, well, I'm glad you asked.
Now, do not you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with a normal steak knife?
Ahh!
Now, I know what you're thinking
Does the pregnant woman play at four?
Phoebe, they did not charge you knives, did you?
No!
Are you sure?
No!
Honey, you will not earn enough money to help Frank and Alice simply by selling knives.
No, no, I know, but I have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
What is the second part of your plan?

You are right.
Why?
I'm tired of attacking two women, it did not work.
What?!
No, I mean, it's all right, I mean, I'm ... they're my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, did you attack your ex-wife ?!
Oh, no!
Ninth!
No I am tired!
But I could not.
That's why I'm here.
Maybe we could attack them together?
That ... that's a no.

What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Friend, if you come back, you'll be Dead Ross!
I do not care! I'm not quitting! I insist to finish this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing it, let me help you at least.
No, God no! It is not a place for a woman. Those guys will take something.
No. That's not what I'm saying. I could just know some things that could help you inflict pain.
I like it.
Yes? Listen carefully, Devon has a weak ankle.
Eh?
A quick kick and he will pull back.
All right, ugly ankle, get it!
And that big guy with a beard has a deceptive hip.
Yes.
And uh, and David over there, I heard he does not bring a cup.
Yes? I can use that, joking hip, no cup, okay! All right!
And you, Liam, Liam has bad knees. You hit him on the right and he will come down like a lamp.
But ... but Liam is on my team.
I do not care! Just take it!
I'm going to get it! Ok, I'll go back inside!
The Red Ross! All right.

Oh! Oh by the way?
Uh-hmm.
James Brolin?
Oh I know. I could only think of two names, he and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he was gay.
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?!

Hello?
Hi, is Ross there?
No it is not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce attorney, just told him that since I did not hear from him, I assume he decided to try marriage.
Ross remarried - Nooooooo !!!!!!!!!

Oh, oh! Ok, he's kicking up!
Oh! It's growing inside of you.
Whoa !!
Oh!
Wow, it was great.
I think it's the youngest girl to ever refuse me.
Oh hey guys!
Of course, I can go out until I have to meet you. What ... How come you're not going?
I have a job interview so I have to be ready.
I thought you already had a job.
And people say they do not pay attention.
No, this is a much better job.
He is vice president of a company that performs data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do it?
This is what I do now.
Hey, Joey, come and taste this.
What is that?
Do you remember that guy who gave me a bad review? Well, I'm taking revenge!
Did you cook it?
No.
He teaches a course of food criticism at the New School, so before going to the cinema I want to go there and let him try my bouillabaisse again.
Oh, I can not wait to read the first page of the Post tomorrow!
"The restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
The first page? You really live in your little world, do not you?

So, did you find someone who marries you guys again?
No, but Horny called Monica, to find out if we were still together.
We will never find anyone.
Well, let me do it!
Joe
No-no-no!
Look, I was thinking about it.
I'm a real actor?
So I will not get nervous talking about people.
Joey looks really sweet
No-no-no-no look no!
I will not spit and I will not stare at Monica's breasts!
You know?
Everyone knows I'm a donkey!
This is true.
Yes, and the most important thing is that it will not be a bit like it, a stranger up there that barely knows you.
I'll be me!
And I swear I'll do a great job.
Besides, you know, I love you and ... and that would mean a lot to me.
You know, we have not found anyone else.
It could be a bit cold.
So can I do it?
Ah-ha! Too arrogant!

I still can not believe they took my key away. You trust me with yours.
Of course I do it! And I'll give it back to you as soon as they've finished it at the key point.
What the hell is that?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
You said there was a gas leak here.
Well, why do not you use your key?
Because when I find it on this thing, the whole place could have exploded.
If it happens in another building I manage, people will start asking questions.
Come on!
Hurry up.
Oh! We could have done it.

Fortunately, the guy he's adapted to can not hear what you're talking about.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Um, and maybe I'm wrong!
But, you know, I'll go out with him again, I'll find out more.
Do you think this guy is destined for someone else and will you keep going out with him?
Well, it may not be my soul mate, but a girl has to eat.

(going up with this
God Ross, what is it?
Oh, but it made her so happy.
The girl is missing her cat.
Mad thinks that her mother is in a cat.
Okay, you know what, I have to go to dinner with my son, I can trust you when you see Phoebe, you'll tell him.
Yes.
Thank you.
I
He's right, is not he?
You know what, I think this could be one of the times he's wrong.
You think?
Oh-no, he's right.

Seven hundred dollars!
All right, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, two weeks hell, eh? Do you know what, though? I really feel like I've learned something.
Really? So, will you stick with this thing 'it's all for you'?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man opens his eyes, does he walk like this?

Oh.
You know, those are a delicacy in India.
Me too.
Even if this city is my home, like this.
So it's stupid what I said, do not tell him I said it.
Umm, do something.
Nice thank you.
This is me.
Here.
Your eyes are very cute.
Thanks a lot! Oh! Thank you!
He would like to kiss you.
Okay, you know what, you do not have to do it now.
No-no-no-no !!
Not him, you do not!
Well, the moment is over.
Oh.
Oy!

Hey! Wait a minute, wait a minute. Do you think these pearls are beautiful?
I would really prefer a mountain bike.
Janice's birthday is coming, I want her to have something special. Come here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
Ah, you want to bring her something special, bring her flowers, get candy, get rubber, girls love rubber.
It's a good idea, "Dear Janice, I have a Hubba-Bubba birthday". I'd like to do something serious.
Oh, you want something serious.
You know what you should do, you should take one of those um, barium enemas.
Those died seriously
All right. Look, I'm going here, and you never buy me anything.
No, no, you can not, you can not, okay, you can not, you can not buy its pearls, you can not, you can not, you can not.
Why not?!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, that's the thing, okay, the thing is ...
What is the thing?
All right. I went to the "Mattress King" showroom and I saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?
They were in his office.
Well, she would not do it, she's with, she's with me.
All right!!

I'm telling you that it's like watching Bambi learn to walk.
You're drunk! Mom and dad will become maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Right here! Can we have some here, please? Here we are.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did not I tell you to come directly to me when other crab cakes were ready?
How do you feel?
You
I really wish you did not do it.
Now all you have to do is spend a little more, ok?
Then we can get you to bed, okay?
Just smile and do not talk
Speech! Speech! We hear from the celebrated! Eh?
Phoebe !!
You do not see? Everyone is watching me! The plan works! I did not even have to take my head off!
Speech! Let's go Monica!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
Hey Chandler, you can not keep your hands away for a second!
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
Well, you gotta because maybe it's stupid.
Well, just as Monica and I were dancing with them, it was the first time I knew you were the woman with whom I wanted to dance all my dances.
Oh shit!

All right.
The super could not understand what he did.
A $ 200 an hour electrician could not understand what he was doing.
I had seven pretty serious shocks.
I officially give up.
Thanks God.
I guess Joey was right, he does not do anything.
To see? I'm doing. I'm doing it totally. I lost it.

Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
He has no one.
Yes, we ... we feel a bit responsible.
I can not believe you said woowoo. I do not even say woowoo.
Oh, it's coming! Is coming!
People, when we come back we'll talk about his new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
You may want to put the children to bed for this.
You know, we do not have to look at this.
In no way, forget it.
Come on, it's your mother!
Exactly.
Chandler, I have to tell you, I love your mother's books!
I love his books!
I can not get on a plane without one!
I mean, it's fantastic!
Yeah, well, you would not think it would be nice if you're eleven and all your friends go through page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch'.
Come on, Chandler, I love your mother. I think it's an explosion.
Thank you.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Thank you. Uh Rach?
Yes?
Why does my cinamon stick have a rubber?
Oh! Here because. I'm sorry!

Oh. Oh! Mrs? Excuse me Miss?
Yup?
You can not put a cigarette on a tree!
Yes, I can, it worked really well.
No, but you should not! Do not you ever do it again.
I will not do that! Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Stop punk!
What?!
Yes, it's true, you're so angry. Book 'em.
Who are you talking to?
Save it red! Unless you want to spend the night in jail, you apologize to the tree.
I'm
We apologize with the tree right now or I'm calling for backup. Backup! !! Backup
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Ok, delete the backup! Cancel backup!

Shh! Take me out of here.
Oh.
Ross!
What?
Come here, look at this!
What? Is it the comet?
No! No, no. Look, there's a bug stuck in the tar here.
Joey come - I can not believe it - I'll bring you here to see King Bapstein's comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomena, and all you care about are insects stuck in tar and ... and some women!
You know, there is
Show me where?
Right here.
Joey where is the pipe that held the door open?
I do not know! Yes I do it.
Joey!
What?! All right, hey! Do not look at me! You're the one who wanted to come and look for stupid people
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!

Wow! This place is amazing! The Sting pen he gave Phoebe. Come on! Secret Passage!
Hello!
Hello!
I'm Trudie.
Uh Huh.
You must be Ben's mother.
Why else should I be here?
Sit down
Yes.
Oh Rach is magnificent. Is fantastic.

Hi .. how was the game?
Well..
WE WON!! Thank you! Yup!
Fantastic! I have a question: how is it possible?
Alan.
It was incredible.
It was like that-that-cartoon Bugs Bunny where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was the first base-Alan, the second base-Alan, the third base -...
I mean, it was like he made us a team.
Yes, we certainly showed Hassidic's jewelers a thing or two on the softball.
Can I ask you a question? Have you ever thought that Alan is ... sometimes ...
What?
.. I do not know, even a little Alan?
Well no. It's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Yes, it's his, innate Alan-ness that-that-we worship.
Personally I could have a gallon of Alan.

Well I enjoyed it! I learned to cook, to eat good food, this is the first A I got from the seventh grade,
Oh look! Acting for beginners! Do you want to feel good about yourself?
What the hell!
All right.
Well, let's start with some basics. Can someone tell me what is the difference between the stage and the stage?
Yes, this was a stupid idea.

My God!
These pants are burning!
Oh come on, she wants to curl up now!
What is he trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano in here!
Are you hot?
All right, it must only be me then.
They were just the pants on the sofa. Umm, hello, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
You're driving me crazy with that!
Ok, I'll stop.
Do not stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could do that shot!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You want to play?
Chandler, I can not play, Ross will be home soon.
And I have to write five full pages if I respect his program.
Well, then, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until you get home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we made a quantum leap?
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter.
Ok, but be careful, because I want to get our security deposit back.
Yes, I think we said goodbye when we invented the hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not sprayed?
Uh yes, right here.

Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? All right! How would you like a Tiki Death Punch?
What is that?
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Yes, honey, you would not lose this.
Relax. You're only nine centimeters. And the child is at zero station.
You're really scaring me.
Someone wants to help me, trying to tear my heart out. Uh, it's fantastic. Has anyone seen a nipple?
All right, ten centimeters, here we are.
All right, honey, it's time to start pushing.
But I'm not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can not tell the child to wait for them.
Oh God.

Here we are. Mona umm, I think it's time to talk about where things are with us.
Yes, I think I suggested it.
Aw, we - we are so So, well I - I - I like you and I - I love umm, you can go out with you.
And I mean ... I'm having a lot of fun.
All right.
I mean, it makes no sense to spend time with someone if ... if it's just fun.
Must be, must go somewhere right?
So where ... where is it going?
Ah!
Here ... this is the real question.
And-and the answer is that it's going somewhere funny.
Now I - I know what you're thinking, the fun was good for you like ten years ago, you know, but you're not getting younger.
No, I mean ... No, not you, you, you
I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?
You know what?
I'll take you out to dinner tonight.
I found this place that makes the biggest mozzarella sticks and jalepino popcorn.
No?
Really?
They taste so good.

Drumroll.
All right. All right. All right. Help! Am I a Mark or a John?
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you could be a good Barney.
All right, I'm serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 am I will go to court.
Are you really doing it?
Hey, look, this name has held me for a lifetime.
Ok, that's probably why the kids chose me at school, and why I never do well with women. So, starting at 4 tomorrow, I'll be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You have problems because of you!
Not your name!
All right, this must end!
Chandler is a great name!
In fact, yes, I am, I'm sorry.
I know you really wanted me to call little Joey, but eh, so, I-I, I'll do it, I'll call little Chandler.
Damn! I thought it would be romantic to die for!
Was.

Look, I just saw my best friends in the brain smeared on the canvas, it will not be me, not me.
Wow! That was good. That was ... Tweezers?
No.
Whoa. It was really good
Thanks, any suggestions?

Hello!
You-did you have sex with Ursula ?!
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she came in and I thought it was you and I kissed her
Did not you notice that he wore different clothes ?!
Well, I was so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! You know what? This is too strange
No-no it is not!
I do not want to lose you!
It's as if I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought I was in you ... Yes, it's too weird.
So I guess this is it.
Yes. Maybe it's for the best. Feel just like her.
Yes, you too.

Hey!
Hello.
So, do shopping make you feel better about Ross?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well,
Can?
Yes. I just need you to bring me some pictures of Ross.
Um-hmm.
And a piece of chocolate.
All right.
Ok, we have to talk. I'm just coming out of a very serious relationship
I know! And I'm just coming out of a wedding, I mean talking about what it means to be!
Right! I just think it's happening too soon.
Oh, too early, too much schmoon. Admit it darling, I will not let you escape this time.
I hear you. But! Unfortunately, my company is moving me abroad!
Oh no! Where is it? Too much Paris?
No! No! No, Paris.
Even in London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
Okay, could you stop talking for a second? Yemen. Yes, yes, I was transferred to Yemen!
When?
I do not know exactly.
Uh, well, I'll just have to dive from Chandler Bing every so far.
But I know it's some time tomorrow.

Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
Great! Go get it.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
He's not really my type.
No, not you, dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what he likes. People tell doctors everything.
But you said he was an exceptional guy!
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then turn out to be the biggest idiots.
You attract some stinking.

Chandler.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're adorable today. And I can say, this is a
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stay in his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen.
If it's about those jokes reminders, I've had nothing to do with them.
Really.
Nothing at all.
Really.
Anything.

You know, when we get together, can I get a gumball machine?
Obviously! Joey would not let you have one?
No. When it comes to desserts, it's surprisingly strict.
Hey, did you find a way to tell him you're moving?
No, no, I keep trying, you know?
I can go out, "Joey, I too" but then I lose my nerve and I always end up with "going to the toilet".
He might think I'm sick.
You know, I just have to tell Rachel, but I just have to finish it!
You know, the next time we see them, we'll tell them.
All right?
That's all.
Oh, so it will work now? Do you want to order me all the time?
Quite.
All right.
Hey Monica!
Hello!
Hey friend, are you feeling better?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
My God! You're pregnant!
Yes, if you get married in Las Vegas, you're only married in Las Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Las Vegas, you're married everywhere.
Really?!
Yes!
OMG! -Oh! Well

See that guy? Now it's in the classics, but you know that as soon as we leave we'll go straight to porn.
He is about to go to the desk with
Yes.
I lost this.
Me too.
So, do you want to get a burger or something?
Yup! Yup! Yup! Yup! Awww!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, you know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We.
Okay, Rachel, you want to put marshmellows in concentric circles.
No,
Every year.

IS
Hey! Ross!
Die Hard
Yes. Hey, what do you think we do a double function?
What did you rent?
Die Hard 2
Joey, this is it
Oh, well, we look at him a second time and his
Joey, us
IS?
And it will be nice to see it again! Yes!
Die Hard
Friend, you did not say
Yes, I just had, I have plans.
Well, John McClane had plans!
No, you see I want to get out of here before Joey gets aroused and starts calling everyone bitch.
What are you talking about? Bitch.

I know you did the wrong thing on purpose.
I can not prove it yet, but when I do, you're going to jail for murder.
I do not care if you're my brother.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your article on the dotted balance in the Devonian era was top notch!
Stop taking a look at my things!
Hey!
Hey!
I just wanted to let you know that I changed my mind: I will, I will kiss Joey.
No you can not! Friends who connect are a bad idea.
Please, and you and Chandler?
It's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Good bye!
What about all the guys you got phone numbers with? Why do not you just kiss one of them?
I could, I could but I do not want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I will do it.
And I can not stop you.
No.
Hey Rachel, did you see Charlie anywhere?
I'm smarter than

Oh, hey, Gunther, take a look.
Yes, that ... that Chandler makes me collapse.
Hey, Ross, listen, you want something to drink, because I'm going up there.
Uh, yes, I'll take a coffee Thanks man.
Sure. Coffee? Because I'm going up there.
No.
No thanks.
You guys need something, because I'm going up there.
I would like an ice water.
You got it right.
Joey, what are you doing?
Simply be friendly.
Joey, honey, I do not think you should go back there.
No, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Do not wink at me. And wear your apron.
Ok, but I can not see you ask any other paying customer to wear aprons.
Joey, do you work here?
No.
Hey, waiter.
Yes?

You have reached Monica and Chandler, if you are listening to this message, we will probably do it. Yes, we are
Hi, I'm Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
I'm calling Monica Geller.
I want to let you know that there has been a cancellation and if you are still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom !!

Thank you.
Thank you.
I can not believe! This is like the worst night ever!
You know, Monica, you had a small setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's just Chandler. I'm
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid topic. I do not even want to see Richard anymore.
So go repair it!
Go find Chandler!
It's probably in your room!
Tell him you're sorry and you love him.
You know what? You're right, Phoebe. You are right. Thank you!
Sure! Yes! Las Vegas, number one!
Does anyone lose it?
Comin out. Place your bet The dice are out. Double or nothing! Pay in the front line!
Hmm.

Do you remember where the duck's food is?
Yes, it's in the boys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Because I'm going to London.
What?! What do you mean to go to London?
Yes, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
Now baby, you take care, you do not have those kids until I get back.
Rachel, you can not go! Ross loves Emily!
Yes, I know, I know, I know he knows.
But I have to tell him how I feel!
It deserves to have all the information and therefore can make an informed decision.
That's not why you're going!
You're going because you're hoping he'll say, "Yes, I love you too, Rach.
Forget that british chippy. "
Ohh, do you think he will do it ?!
No!
Because he's in love with the British Chippy!
Look, Rachel, if you go, you'll get your head wrong and ruin your wedding!
You know, it's too late!
You're lost, you have chances!
I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
You know what? No. It's not over until someone says "I do".
I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it! Uh, how can I really chase you. I'm bringing a litter.

So are everyone here?
I arrived here a little early.
Let's start.
Now, the hydrosaurides have been unearthed in two main places.
Here.
Here.
Now as for the hydrosaurs

Well, so anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is that I should have considered your feelings before I came home with you that night.
I ha, I recently learned what it means to be on your side, and I'm sorry.
So, do you think you can forgive me?
Great.
Thank you.
OK Bye.
Hi, Jennifer?
Oh hello, Mrs. Loreo, is there Jennifer?
Oh, it's not at home eh?
Well, actually, I need to talk to you too.

Hey!
Hello.
Are you OK?
Uhh ... I think I just got engaged.
My God! Did he do it?
Well ... did you know he would ask me?
Are you kidding?
I am like the one who convinced him.
I like to think of myself as the puppeteer of the group.
And do you really think it's a good idea?
I just interviewed him, do not tell me I have to do it too. The puppeteer gets tired.
I just do not know! It simply does not seem right.
Why?! You two are so destined to be together, everyone thinks so.
Really?! Ross too?
Above all Ross!
Oh uh, hey Phoebe. You know what? I'll come back later.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of full house here. I just imagine ... I'll be back.
Here it is, your girlfriend.
I think so.
Even if he plays with himself in his sleep.
I can not say I'm surprised.

Oh, it's so unlucky.
What?
Cute naked boy is really starting to get fat.
Ok, I'll be back in a minute. Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You did not leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Oh, then it must have been you. Hello.
Bye Bye! That's why I went out.
Hey, you know when we're here, when you tell my sister you do not live here anymore.
I think he already knows at some levels.
Night Mon Night Julio.
Adios.
Look at Julio, someone left their book here.
Ah, actually, this is mine.
Oh yes, what are you reading?
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Did you read it?
I read it? No, are you enjoying yourself?
I thought so, but the translation is not good.
You are a poet and you do not know it.
Actually I ah, I'm a poet.
Oh, you know that. So, what kind of things do you write?
Things that move me, the shadow of a tree, a laughing child, or this lip.
Mine? Right here?
I can write an epic poem on this lip.
How was it going? Well, he did not rhyme, but I liked it.

Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
What?
We are at my stop. But would you like to have a coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?
Yes. So, coffee?
The coffee looks fantastic. Wait, so, do you live in Montreal?
Oh, no. But it's only a two-hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

Ok, here's the batch 22.
Oh, maybe these will look a little like those of your grandmother.
This has some orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Let's try.
All right. Friend, I have
Oh, for what? How a sale of baked goods?
No, just a Friday night.
Would you do it?
Would you do it? You ate my candy bar!

Oh my God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know, honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I want to quit, but then I think I should stick to it, so I think why such a person should stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's distantly related to the field they're interested in.
Damn, I do not know Rach. To sort !! I took a Yentel soup, a James Beans and a Howdy in possession of the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I did not ...
I do not mind paying my debts, you know, it's just how much I'll learn about fashion by walking towards Mira, the arthritic seamstress, in the bathroom.
Hello! Is my misery fun for you?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah ....
It's not fun, this is actually my job.
Oh believe me, I_I_I was there. I had to order dummy heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, so I'll be back to talk to my friend here.
And you can go back to enjoy your little hamburger.
Ah, just another thing.
Yup?!
I, I work at
Do you want my pickle?

Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Why?
I just want to check my horoscope, see if it was right.
My God.
Phoebe.
Do not look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and throw us into a depression pit.
Where is it? Ooh, come to mom.
He's coming. Be calm, be calm, be calm.
We should do something. Whistle.
We're not going to whistle.
Come on, do it.
No!
Just do it!
No!
Do it foul!
Woo-woo!
I can not believe you did it!

Hello! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm Alessandro's chef.
Yet?
I think the things you said about me are really unjust, and I would like you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
I see no reason why I would like to do it again to myself.
Eat it, or come in.
Spoon? So, what do you think?
I am torn between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I have to be honest, your soap is abysmal.
Thata girl! Eh? We should get out of here; there is a new class coming soon.
Welcome to the introduction to the kitchen. Now, before you start, can someone tell me the difference between a Dutch sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
I can.
Ok, proceed.
Well, they both have an egg yolk and a base of butter, but a beetroot has scallion, shirvel and, above all, tarragon.
It's very good, what's your name?
Monica.
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
All right.

And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seen.
But they tell me that for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen.
Humaaan spleeeeen.
Ole!
What are you doing here!
Well, you said you had customers lined up on the street, so I'm here to entertain!
Great!
Yes!
It was really great, you know, some of these people saw me play before because they were asking for a lot of my songs!
Yes, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
Listen to Phoebe ...
Yes.
You know how much I like listening to your music, you know, but ...
But what?
This is a kind of class seat.
Ok, do not say anything else.

I'm so bored! Rain stupid, we ... we can not do anything.
Well, I brought books. We could read
Hey, it has not arrived yet.
Hey Hey Hey! It does not matter if I do it!
I'm sorry, sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
Hey, Rach, do you want to go to a convention?
We can not. We are not pharmacists!
I know we are not, but Frank Medeio and ... Eva Trorro ... womba ...
Kate Miller?
Kate Miller is.
And ... this is the most sex part I'll have this weekend.
If so, should I make sure it's really good?
Thank you.

My God!
We've heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
This year must have been fantastic!
But it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that do not even fit!
No. No, you're not a loser.
Watch me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben designed your picture! Eh? You're ... you're a cowboy!
Oh, because of the leather pants.
To see? Ben does not think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now it's something.
Yes!
This is really something; It's really fantastic
Good companion!
Maybe I should have another pair!
Ooh, you know, they ... they had a little fringe on all sides.
I'm going to kiss Ben, goodnight.
I can not believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would be a good cowboy.
Ok, now that it's all over here, I think I'm, I'm going to do the laundry.
Oh yes, me too. You know if this shirt is dirty. Yup.
No you did not. You said you would do it, but you never did it!
Oh yeah!

Great nap.
It was really.
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends that I am.
So we talk about women. I'm sure our women readers will be interested in learning about your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, as I do, I look at a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how's it going?"
Oh please!
Hey how's it going'?

Hey, Mikey
Hey P
What are you doing?
Setting the mouse traps.
To kill Bob ??
No, no, to test his neck strength.
No, Mike, I do not want to kill him!
I thought we would capture him and, as you know, free him in the countryside where he could meet a friendly friend and a hostile owl.
Ok, ok, throw away the traps.
I'll find Bob, I'll take it.
Bob?
Bob!
Roberto!
Oh wait, I think I heard it.
Oh - Oh my god!
Bob had children!
Bob is a mother!
Better to think of a new name for him.
I do not know, I like Bob for a girl.
I do not know, I mean, I'm not sure ...
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Maybe it was not Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Suzie?

Hmmm, soup!
Joey, Ross will be here any minute now, would you mind looking at Ben for me while I was using the women's room?
Oh yes, no problem
Thank you.
Hi Ben! So you want to be an actor eh? I have to tell you, it's not a picnic. There are tons of waste.
Joey!
Which? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yes, but he waited until the last minute!
So if I said yes, he would have known I had nothing better to do than wait for an invitation to his stupid party.
I said no!"
Which puts
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ball? There is no ball.

Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Yes, you know, eh, let's jump.
What?! Why?!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
Oh great! what
Well, ok, look. I do not know, listen, I do not know what's going on here, but let's do it
Do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close to them?
No-no, they are not very kind people.
Ok, listen, I really like you.
All right?
I think this can go somewhere.
So, if I were close to my family, will you let it stop us?
Well, I ... I do not know. See when ... when you put it that way, you can do it
Danny! Hurry up! The bathroom is getting cold!
What?
Yes, ok, see you later.

It's over.
Oh, was it terrible?
Well, it was a ring.
I had not even realized how late it was, until I noticed the shadow of the 5 on his head.
In any case, he did not want to stay.
I called a taxi; she left.
I wrote you a letter
Ohh! Thank you! I like the post.
These are just a few things I was thinking about.
Some things about us, and before we can think of the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
All right. Wow, it's ... it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better break up with this baby.
Well, I'll wait for you, come on when you're done.
All right, I'll be up, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
The waiter brought the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said that we except the
All right, I retract.
But I stay from my review, I know the food and it's not that.
Your marinara sauce is as tasty as tomato juice!
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
My God! Do you own an Italian restaurant and do you think it tastes good? Where are you from?
Lebanon.
Give me those tomatoes, I'll show you how it should be! Come on, give me to me.
How long will that take? Because I received another critic to scream.

Ok, so what happened?
Ohh. Uh Huh. Uh Huh. You will have your turn!
Hey Phoebe, what's going on?
Anything! This is not over!
No! No! No!
What?!
I was up all night writing this really ugly letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-In reality, thank you!
All right! All ready to go to the cinema?
In fact, I think I'll skip it.
Really?
Yes, I will stay and read my book. I just want to be alone now.
Oh. Are you sure you do not want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, receive mail and stuff.
All right, Joe.
All right, let's go to Phoebe.
Oh God!

It was great.
I know.
Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have just started a family.
Nine months from now we can be here, have our baby.
And if not, we have to do it on a bucket.

Ross! You must stop! All right?! You can not just look through the hole for three hours! You will get a nice eye!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I always knew she liked it!
You know, she would say no, but here we are!
Right?
We just broke up, first thing he does!
You have not just broken up.
Hey, it's been three weeks!
You slept with someone three hours after you thought you had broken up. I mean that the bullets have left their weapons for longer!
That's Bill Clinton.
Who is huggin '?
My God! That's Pete! But why Bill Huggin 'Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
We use it !!
Here it is !!
Oh my God, Monica will come out with a millionaire.
I will not go out with him.
Oh my God, I can not believe this is a real $ 20,000 check, oh this is so exciting.
Or incredibly offensive.
Oh yes, of course, that too.
What?

Hey, so, do you know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yeah!
Well, you know how I'm trying to fix things with Emily.
Well, there's this thing, okay, here it is.
I made a promise that - Oh hey!
What?
Your nose is bleeding!
Oh God.
No!
Oh, not again!
This-this happened when my grandfather died.
It's ugh!
Sorry.
Oh, ok, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Umm
Sorry. Sorry.
Ok, I can not see you anymore.
Yes I know. It's ridiculous! I can not see you either.

Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hi, Chip.
Hey, Rach! How are you'?
I am big! I am big. I have a great job at
So, is Monica still ready?
He will stay out in a second. So, Chip, how are you, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Wow! I have not seen her since ... So, is Monica ready?

That's right, I love you! And ... and I will play with you all the time.
How can you let him talk to your horse like that?
He is talking to the child.
Ohh!
All right!
Okay, because when-when he said "I can not wait to hear your first words", I thought, "There's a trick."
All right. Well, I have to go guys. See you later.
All right.
Oh my, oh my God!
Aw, it's amazing!
Wow!
She is kicking so much!
Oh, she's like umm oh who is that kind of annoying soccer player?
Mia Hamm?
Mia Hamm!
Oh, it's fantastic
Oh, oh !! A hand on the sheet Joe!
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!

Ok, what do you guys think?
Guy!
I've never known a love like this.
Do you really like it?
Guy! How did you write this?
I stole Monica and I changed her name.
You can not
If it goes first, it can!

Hey!
Yes!
In any case, I - I still think we should try to fix things, you know?
For example, maybe we could take him to get tickets for another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow, it's a great idea! IS
Here it is.
Oh.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I took this.
Here it is.
You know, I have to tell you, sometimes just ... I do not understand Chandler.
You know, he and I do stuff all the time without you and do not get angry.
All time?
All time!

Cassie, how are you ... how are you doing with that hot dog.
I finished.
Thanks God.
I guess the last time we really enjoyed it was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh right.
Right.
Ooh, remember when I ... I nailed you and tickled until you cried?
We're probably too old to do it now.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all these freckles.
Uh Huh! Uh Huh! E-e-and I'll always remember that summer because it's when I realized we're related.
It took you so long to understand it, eh?
Well, I am, I'm a bit slow. Just like our children would be.

Relax any muscle in your body.
Listen to the plutky-plunky music.
Ok, now close your eyes and think of a happy place.
Ok, tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
All right. No, no, no, not a thing about Richard, put the glass down. And leave!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, ok, well, use my happy place.
Ok, I will, I have to ask you not to move anything.
All right, I'll try not to do it.
Ok, okay, so, yours in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky ....
Do you think breaking up with him was a big mistake?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Ok, just, the warm breeze and the moonlight flowing through the trees ....
I bet it's totally over me, I bet it's fine.
All right, bet and bet of any kind, I'm sure, I'm not allowed in the happy place.
All right.
Just, you know, the beautiful waterfalls and the dripping fountains.
And the ... the calming sounds of the stream ...
Ok, this does not work. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.

OK honey, see you later.
See you later.
Bye bye Julie.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, come on, cut it off.
Hey?
What?
Can I ask you something?
Hey, Rach, do you want to hear the new song I'm thinking of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Ok.
Uh, Rachel, honey, could I see you for a minute?
What happens?
F.Y.I ..
I decided to pay a professional musician to play here on Sunday afternoons.
His name is Stephanie ... something.
It should be very good.
What do you think of Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not like your friend is bad, it's so bad, it makes me want to put my finger in my brain and turn it around.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you can not do this.
Uh ...
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. Do I have to do this to you?

Ahh, no.
Oh.
You're jealous?
No, I know I do not see why she has to play with you, that's all.
I mean, do not you have any friends mothers strippers?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous.
All right, umm, people hear certain things about the strippers.
And you know, and um, I ...
Honey, I love you too
Ugh. Wait wait wait.
What?
Huh.
Well, there's a kiss he will not forget for a couple of hours, you know.
Yes. Or that, or you just turned it on and sent it to a stripper.

I can not believe you're back.
Do not say anything
I do not want to talk, I do not want to think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love with me right here, right now.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
You lost the exit!
Oh sorry.
My God, what were you thinking?
Um, Barry.
Awwww !!

I ... I thought you were doing it, I did not know you were in love!
Guy!
And hat to Phoebe. Rather a competitor. And I could say that your breasts are still showing.
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Well, actually, Ross does not.
Yes, and we would appreciate it if no one had told him.

Dear Mary-Angela.
Hello.
How are you.
This is the most difficult letter I have ever written.
What the hell is a problem with you?
How do you think Joey will react when he finds out that you blew your sister with a letter?
Well, this is the part where you tell him I moved to France. When in reality I will be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, you have to do it alone, okay in person.
At least you know his name.
Go home and ask Mary-Angela, okay, when she comes to the door, take her for a walk, let her fall easily.
What if Mary-Angela went to the door and I asked about Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?

Hey.
You may be right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Umm, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
All right.
Ok, here it is. I have two queens, what's wrong?
A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you won! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Oh yeah! Ok, let's play again. What do you have?
A four and a nine.
You're joking, right?
No because?
Well, this is a full cup!
Damn! I'm good at Coppe!

What? Why? Where are you?
I'm still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! I'm sorry! The boy is drunk, they will not let me go until we understand.
My God! I have to find another minister.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look, look, you put them both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Do not hang up on me! I will marry you and you now! I've got the power!

Oh hey Joey! What happens?
I can not decide which route to take in Las Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot, have you?
Yes, I've been around.
Ok, so, which road should I take for the northern or southern road?
Ooh, if you take the northern road there is a man in Illinois with a beard.
Ok, I have to protest, I've lived in Illinois all my life and I do not know any bearded man!
Wisconsin, on the other hand, could be a different story.
Great! Problem solved!
Estelle, you have to get me a job. I lost my health insurance.
All right, first thing we have to do, damage control.
Why?
Well, I think someone out there could have gotten you bad in the whole city.
Bastard!

You mean every time Monica and Chandler are like when you do the laundry or go shopping or ... oh!
All that time Monica went to the phone with the sad Linda of the camp!
Uh-huh, do it. Doing it. Telephone that does it.
Oh!
Oh, I can not believe it!
I mean, I think it's great!
For him.
It may be able to do better.
Hey guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
Phoebe just heard about Monica and Chandler.
Do you mean how they are friends and nothing more?
No. Joey, her
Ok, now they know you know it and they do not know that Rachel knows that?
Yes, but you know what?
It does not matter who knows what.
Now, enough of us know that we can simply tell them that we know it!
Then all the lies and secrets would finally be over!
It is a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided he was gay, he left and left all his family.

You know, you're a friend who gets married, he has to change things.
Do you really think it would be different?
How could it not be?
I want to say that soon we will have children, and then they will go out with other couples who have children.
And then maybe they will have to leave the city to be close to
Well, things change.
I do not want them to move to
Everything will be fine, Joe.
It's still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
It could be out of town. Maybe he will leave for months.
At that point, the cheesecake may have gone wrong. We do not want you to go back to a bad cheesecake.
No, that could kill her.
Well, we do not want it.
No, so we're protecting it.
But we should take it.
But we should move fast.
Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving in there.
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!

Hey, Kicky. What are you doing?
I'm just trying to get comfortable. I can not sleep in my underwear.
Well, you will do it.
I was thinking. You know, about how I always see girls on girls ...
Are they running out, or tall as pancakes?
You know what I mean, about how I always go out with all these women.
And I always thought, when the right one comes, I would be able to be a boy standing and go far, you know?
Now I'm looking at my father, thinking ...
Hey, you're not him.
It is you.
When they took you to go to your father's pipe business, did you get away?
No.
No.
You have decided to enter the world of actors out of work.
It was not easy, but you did it!
And I would like to believe that when the right woman arrives, you will have the courage and the courage to say "No thanks, I'm married".
Do you really think that?
Yes. I really do it
Thanks, Chandler.
Get off!

Hello.
Your Fettuccine Alfredo seem a bit 'dry, you used all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean to eat as a pre-cooking snack?
And the cream?
The cheese makes me thirsty.
All right. Go on.
All right.
Oh! Something smells good at Monica station! My God! This is absolutely amazing! Have you never done it before?
Oh no!
I do not know anything about the kitchen.
I had to ask someone what's his name when, when the water makes those little bubbles.
Well, hat to the chef.
I-I-I'm sorry, you-your mouth was full, I did not hear what you said. Umm, hello to whom now?
The cook!
Quite right.

Hey, Phoebe.
Hey.
How are you?
Good. Oh, oh! Roger is having dinner and wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
Nothing, um, it's just, um ... It's Roger.
I do not know, there's just something on ...
Basically we feel that he is ...
We hate that guy.
Yes. I hate it.
Sorry, Phoebe, we're sorry.
Uh Huh.
All right.
Okay, do not you think, maybe, is it just that it's so perspicacious that it scares you?
... No, we hate it.
We are sorry.

Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
I'm postponing all these things that Chandler bought from guilt.
Yes, this was mine.
Because I thought you'd connect with a girl and she left him there.
Yes, it would have made more sense.
You know, I-I do not even know you're more man!
All right, look, I only ask you this time.
And whatever you say, I will believe you.
Were you or were you not on a gay cruise?
!

Oh hey! There are children playing in the street, do you want to go there and give them a project, ruining their day?
Hey, if they have a ball, maybe you can put razor blades and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
He said what?
He said: "If I'm not happy to get married somewhere we find in one day, well, then we should just postpone".
Bring back?
Emily, do you think Monica understands how much our parents spent on this wedding?
The brain of a young child of my sister understands that people have lost time from their lives to fly thousands of miles from here, eh?
This is not right.
I realize that people will be disappointed. But I'm sure they will come back when we can do it well.
Can not I ask people to do it? Would you ask people to do it?
Do not point your pants against me!
We have no choice!
Wherever it's decent, it would have been booked months ago, Ross, do not you understand?
This is our marriage that I'm talking about.
The only thing I understand is; postponing is not an option. This is when we will get married.
So what are you saying? Is it now or never?
No. I'm saying it's time.
OR?
There is no "o" in mind. What's wrong with these pants? !!
They are not pants.
You're the one behind you.
And if, and if you do not understand how important it is to me, well then, maybe we should not marry at all!
Do not wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please

Hi sweetie.
See you later.
What? I bought groceries, I was going to make you have dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Hi, I'm Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to let you know that there has been a cancellation and if you are still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
Oh please, he did not hear it! He did not hear it !!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
NOOOO !!!!!!!!

But! What are you doing here?
I came to give you this and this.
Oww! Great ring!
Yes, always. I want the child to know my voice.
Are you talking about me?
Yes, yes, always.
Really?
But um, we refer only to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.

Would you look at this landfill? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much bullshit?
In fact, I think this apartment cheats on the good name of shit
Check it. Can I have it?
What?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
Suddenly, Leon, the manager, calls me in his office.
It turns out that they fired the head chef of lunch, and guess who got the job.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Fortunately it's me.
And, they made me the head of the purchase, thank you very much.
Anyway, I just met Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
You know, a nice place.
Yes, a nice place.
Yes!
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?

So, what do you think?
I think it's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
So, how does it work, are you going to balance the dishes with the heads of these guys?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Let's play!
Look on Ross! Point! You are disgusting!

What is this?
Thank you. Get comfortable.
Gotcha.
This place is really my grandmother.
I got her from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I would never have been able to afford a place like this.
So, if the landlord asks, I am an 87-year-old woman who is afraid of her video recorder.
So are you thirsty?
Oh, you can bet on it!
Ok, here's your penis!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
How was your first day?
Oh ok.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Thanks, it's from my mother. So this is the kitchen.

Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Great! How about going to the Italian place on Bleaker Street, right?
Ooh, I love that place! Then no.
How about Mama Lisettie?
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long that milk has left.
Oh, no-no, this place is completely healthy!
That ... this milk is mine.
I bought it today because I was thirsty for milk, you know.
OK let's go!
Hello Friend! He knows Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all waste materials to come out
But then I should go around the laundry.
Oh, so you're saying that you'd choose convenience for health ?!
Ok, stop!
Larry, okay, can not you just be Larry and not Larry, the health inspector?
You know, well, at the beginning it was really exciting, but now it's like, okay, so where are we going to eat?
Well, I suppose I could give you a warning.
Thank you.
OK Go!
Leave!
Leave!
Now, if after dinner you still need to make someone fail, I know a hot dog seller who takes his nose.

No! No! Phoebe, let's go! I do not want to pass! Please come! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No, but from Monica you can eat cookies on the sink!
I know. I'm sorry.
All right! It looks so funny.
Yes.
God, what a mess.

Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost.
A young girl lent her uniform to her nineteen-year-old sister, who went to the United States.
Nimitz and has sold over 2000 boxes.
Hey! How was the interview?
Oh, I blew it. He would not even hire me.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you'll go on like a thousand interviews before you find a job.
That's not how he had to go out.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
You know what Rach, maybe you should just, you know you're here at the cafe.
I can not!
It's too late!
Terry has already hired that girl over there.
Look at her, she also had a waitress experience.
Last night he was teaching everyone how to make napkin .... swans.
That word was swans.

What did we get there?
A piece of something: boxers, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-carbonized portrait. Wow, that guy is more hairy than the Boss!
You know, it's a really funny story how it happened.
Everything is alright.
Everything is alright.
You do not have to explain.
This is not the first bonfire of the boyfriend we've seen get out of control.
You're our third call tonight.
Really?
Oh sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.

I'm so sorry, guys. I did not want to take you down.
No, you were right. I do not have a plan.
Thank you God. Food.
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I do not even have a "pl".
No, no, that's not what we ordered ... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Wait! Did you say "G.Stephanopoulos?"
Wait, was it a ... a Mediterranean boy with a curiously clever intelligent appearance?
Wore a beautiful blue suit?
Is it a tie of power?
Oh God.
You are crazy?! We have George Stephanopoulos pizza!
Uh, Phoebe? Who is George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
I see the pizza!
Oh, I want to see! Let me see! Let me see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?

Hey, do you know what a good rainy day is?
What?!
I mean nude game. Strip poker, we should definitely play strip poker.
No, no!
What are you crazy ?!
Come on! When you go away, you have to play, it's like a law!
All done!
Thank you.
Ok, who's next ?!
No-o-o! There's no way!
C'mon, please?! I'm Boredddd! Let me do it once before.
Yes, well, if ah, if this is the rule this weekend ... No!

It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor ever. Whoa! Are you going in there?
What, like a number?
Hey!
Hello! Hello!
Ok, I'm finished with my choices, these are final.
Well, it's now.
Ooh, very official.
Oh yes, well, you know, Chandler printed it on his computer.
And who laminated it?
That would be me.
Okay, let me see Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer and Dorothy Hammel?
Hey, it's my list.
Okay honey, you realize that it just turns like this on ice.

Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings for Fonzie or any of the gods
Hello! And are you going in that class?
Umm, I'm actually a resident of the first year, but I understood a lot, see, I graduated early
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should have specified that I would need an adult doctor.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified for
Shh!
Doogie, shh!
Someone does not understand that soon I will have children?
Eh?
Leave!
Go small boy, go!
Oh nice! You made him cry!

Hey, there are some people out there, asking for candy.
Well, they'll just have to wait, right? I have only two hands !!
Need help?
No! You do not know the system! There will be no one to mess with the system!
Your license please.
You do not ... do not you want to hear about my dream agent?
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
Do you have a son!
I know. I know.

Uh, how could these margaritas?
Hi, Mr. Bing.
I liked your Stevie Wonder last night.
Thank you. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I need them on my desk
Sure.
No problem.
You have to give it something, you know.
Ok, now it was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with a mustache?
Petrie.
Petrie, right, right. Ok, some people will work

....right?
Right?
I mean, it's pretty incredible, I mean, they just took off, they left without even looking back.
You know, I do not, I do not need them, huh, now I have you guys as friends, you and Susan.
Ah, Susan will be so happy.
717? Where is 717? Hey, do you have more for Susan, right?
No. But fine, I'll put pickles or something.
Ross, thank God.
Phoebe? What, why are you whispering?
I ate a bug.
Hey, Rachel, the swabs here are just a penny. We stock up.
Listen Ross, we have finished the gas and we do not know where we are, so we can not take a tow truck.
Oh, now you want a favor?
Yes thanks.
Well, I'm sorry that your car broke Phoebe, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends now, but please call to let me know you've come home safe and sound?
Phoebe, wait a minute. Here, take my car, go get your friends.
No, I will not collect them.
Listen, we both know you'll do it because you're not an idiot.
All right?
So you can pout here for half an hour and then go get them, or spare us both times and pout in the car.
No, Rachel does not want me ...
Look, I_I_I'm sorry that Rachel dumped you because she's in love with that Mark, and you're the innocent victim in all this, but do not punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Yes you are right.

God, I feel so guilty for Ross.
Oh I know.
I feel like it's my fault.
Guy? If you kept this to yourself, none of this would have happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things for myself these days, something was meant to slip out!
Well, I think what you said is very courageous.
All right, I can not sit here anymore. I have to walk in places.
Phoebe, what are you doing with your coat? And the whole thing about animal rights?
Well, I read and for your information, minks are not very nice.
Ok, I admit it!
I love this coat!
Ok, I-it's the best thing I've ever had around me, including Phil Huntley!
Remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine!

So your father has passed. He is a pleasant man!
Oh no
It's better for me to go. (He goes and sits in the
Ross, I'm so sorry. It's okay. I-I promise I'll straighten him up tomorrow with him in person or by e-mail.
I do not care about your father! I'm interested in Mona! She was there and now she's totally out of her mind!
Oh ok, I'll fix it. What is your e-mail address?
Rachel!
All right, I promise. I'll fix it. I swear. I-I-I-I-I will talk to you.
All right!
All right.
Thank you!
That's all?!
Do you call it combat?
Come on!
"We were on a break!"
"No, we were not!"
What happened to you?
!

Hi, could we have two burritos to go, please?
I'm sorry.
But not so sorry, because you do not have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation under the name of Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets for the
I'm sorry. Christmas is a busy period, sir.
Is it because of the burrito thing?
You have to give him some money.
Give him some money? It was a joke!
No, to have a table! Places like this are always shaking you. Everyone wants to be repaid.
Well, calm down, O'Mally. I will give him some money.
You must be calm about it.
Hey, I can be calm.
Listen, we're in a hurry, so if you can get us a table a little faster, I'd appreciate it.
OK sir.
All right.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Ok, you're a hard worker! I will remember to put it in your evaluation.
Thing?
Well, you've been here for two months and your boss is asked to provide a performance evaluation.
But you know, there's one thing I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
No, I always wanted to do it. Can you help me clean this up?

I can dry it.
I can put the gel on it.
It does not matter, I end up with this little uncertain thing in the middle of my head.
It's so boring.
Does it bother you?
You disgust me.
Is there any chance you did not see it?

Hey, Joey, what are you doing?
Sweepin '. Why? Light yourself?
No.
Huh. What happens if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey, done
Where are you going? The vicar will not be home for hours.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Did you find my book?!
Yes i did it!
Joey, what ... what are you doing going to my bedroom ?!
Ok, look, I'm sorry, I went there to take a nap and I know I should not have, but you have porn!
Hey-hey, you know what?
I do not care!
I'm not ashamed of my book.
There's nothing wrong with a woman having fun with a bit of erotica.
It is only a healthy expression of female sexuality, which you will never understand.
You have porn!

Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want shortbreads? Eh is Scottish like you.
Oh no thanks. I do not like
What?!
Well, it's just that my whole family has been short of Scotland from the Vikings. However, many bad memories.
Oh well, it seems to me that your family is ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.
No!
No-no they are not.
I'm still very angry!
But you also know Chandler is half Swedish.
Do you know what the Swedes are famous for?
Sitting and making silence.
Well yes, yes, Scottish history is much more
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding !!
How did you know?

Hello!
Hello!
Come in.
Thanks for the return, umm, okay, there were a lot of people interested in the room, but I narrowed it down
Great!
Okay, before I make my final decision, I just want to make sure that our personalities match.
Ok, I invented a small test.
Now I will say a word and then you will say the first thing that comes to mind.
I can do it.
All right! Here we are. Pillow.
Combat.
Very good! All right. G.
String?
Excellent! Ok, um, little dog.
Kitten?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close, though, bye bye!

Dad, please do not pick your teeth here!
Well, and if you want to lift your feet, why do not you sit on the
Monica, leave it alone
Will you hurry?
Did not you hear me before when I told you that all Janine's friends are dancers ?!
And that they are going to drink a lot!
?
No, I did it, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well, you're doing so slowly! Can not you do it faster?
Joey!
Come on!
I do not want to make mistakes, okay?
This is the only sweet and if they ruin they'll all be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel ruined it?"
So why do not you just let me worry about being silly and just worry about eating it, okay?
Oh, I am!
Ross, if you do not tell him, then I'll do it!
OK well!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, can you wait a second for Joey? I have to say something to my parents. No he can not? All right.

You are so cute! How did you become so cute?
Well, my grandfather was Swedish and my grandma was actually a little bunny.
Ok, now you're even nicer !!
You know, today is a popular opinion, I must say.
What?
The strangest thing happened at the cafeteria, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting me.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you that I think Phoebe thinks I'm crazy.
It is not possible!
Ouch!
I'm sorry it's lonely, Phoebe always thought I was, you were charming in a sexless way.
Oh, you know ... I can not hear it enough.
I'm sorry, I think you just misunderstood it.
No, I did not misunderstand it, okay? She was on me! He touched my bicep to scream loudly!
This biceps?
Well, it's not inflated right now!

It's Phoebe.
Umm, well, I have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, good, umm Grandma is dead.
No, she just died today! Ok, we're doing a funeral service tomorrow.
No you did not!
Well, many people! Listen, do you come to the funeral service or not?
Beautiful. Ok, enjoy your concert.

anyway, it's called Allan and we've been out for three years.
He was my first client when I became a party organizer.
He was organizing a party for his girlfriend at the time.
Oh good.
And he was Theta Beta Pi in Syracuse.
Oh. Oh that's great!
Oh, you're one of
Really? Do you like it?
Well, you know, we would like to repeat everything the other said, or, uh, we would jump out of the closets to frighten each other, or exchange salt sugar to put salt on their cereal.
That's a good one.
Yes? You like that?
Yes, you're funny.
I'm funny?
Oh thank God!
Well, hey, I have a ton!
Umm, oh here ... Do you want a good one?
Here is a good one
Umm, you take a quarter, take a quarter, and you're curious about it.
Right?
And then you say in person, I bet you can not roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without you leaving your face.
And then when they do, they stay with a large line of black pencil right in the middle of their face.
Can I do it for you?
Yeah, me-I-I'm fun Ben, but I'm not stupid. All right?

Chloe? Hello..
Is it on me that you're taking your watch?
Did you get my watch?
I'm sorry, I do.
I keep it, listen, did you tell any of us?
Oh no, I feel it's nobody's business, you know.
Oh, another thing. Hoshi thinks that being in the front row may have influenced my concentration.
Yes. That - that was the problem.

Excuse me, Doug? Hey, passionate about sports !!
Bing! Do you have those numbers for me?
So are you still in touch with someone from high school?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, um, I think it's like that. How are you?
Oh yes, I'm still with Simmons and Zana, you know.
I see a lot of Spindler.
Devane, Kelly and I come across Goldie from time to time.
Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
That's all?
Ehh, you know after high school, you lost a little bit of tact. Oh yeah! I met Richard Dorfman.
Ohh, how are you?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Is not he an architect now?
Yes, they still wear underwear.

So the guy Porsche took his car back.
But did you find the keys to your clothes?
No. No, I'm just uh, I loved the way it feels when everyone thinks they own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you wear clothes?
Really?!
Oh yeah! Yes, so you came across Richard! You grabbed a bite! It is nothing serious.
Great!
Ok, London 1

Hey, Monday, I was just doing the dishes!
Hey!
Oh! It is you. Hello.
What about me?! You - you just said I could!
I'm not even marrying! Ok, this is a question for science fiction writers!
I can not believe you're not kidding me.
Hey, how can you?
Neither am I not even either
Well, you know what, it's all. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my witness.
Yup! Too bad for you man.

Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading the man is here! We go to work.
Umm, slight change of program. We have closed.
C-What?! Why?!
It's a question of money, we do not have any.
You're joking, right?
No.
What?!
It is probably only temporary. We hope to get some money soon, so if you could ... uh, go out.
Uh, go out ?! How long?
I do not know.
A week?
Maybe two?
The money will come!
People will always want to invest in movies!
Hey, you're not rich, are you?
No!
Eh, it's worth shooting. Look at Joey, let me know where you are, okay?
Hey buddy, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yes.
These went away for you.
Thank you. Congratulations on your big chance.

Rachel, did you leave some muffins?
Yes, I forgot which ones.
Oh, you're busy, all right, I understand that. Does anyone else want one?
Hey.
Hey!
So, how was Joan?
I broke up with her.
Do not tell me, because of the great thing about the nostrils?
They were huge. When he sneezed, the bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not so huge.
I'm telling you, leaned back; I could see his brain.
How many perfectly perfect women will you reject the most superficial and insignificant things?
Keep it, keep it.
I must align myself with Chandler on this.
When I moved into town for the first time, I went out a couple of times with this really lovely girl, a big kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
It drove me crazy.
You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women do not have Adam's apples.
Guys, you're joking with me, are not you?
Yes.
It was nice. For a second, I was like "whoa".

Oh my God, he lost it. He totally lost it.
What?
OR! Or we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them at the source.
You are a genius!
Aww, man, now we will not be bank mates!
Now, there are two reasons.
Hey.
Hey!
Ohh, guys, remember that nice customer I told you about? I bit him.
Where is it?!
On touchy.
IS
I do not know!
I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch it, I just want to throw away my old oath and get a new, dirty one.
Well, the next time you massage him, you should try to distract yourself.
Yes! Yes! Yes! I like it when I'm doing something exciting and I do not want to
Thanks, Joey.
No no thanks.

Hey, Estelle, listen
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back eh? They
What are you talking about? I've never left you! You've always been my agent!
Really?!
Yes!
Oh well, not bad, nothing wrong.
Okay, you guys are free tonight?
Yes!!
Tonight? You, you did not say it would be at night.

Yup? Yup?! How can I help you?
Yes, we were just looking around.
Oh-oh, you're a fellow scholar.
What were you looking for exactly, hmm?
Perhaps, perhaps the reflections of Dr. Chester Stock on Smiledon's Californicus?
Uhh.
Ah Ah get out of here! Uh, meet someone? Or ... or are you here just to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Uh, I actually find Marion's views too overly progressive.
I find the views of Marion too overly progressive.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm a professor here, Ross Geller.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-wait! Did you write this?
Yup! Are you the person who checked my book ?!
You know, you do not look anything like what I thought. You're so young.
Well, I skipped the vote.

You did not have the right to tell me that you ever had feelings for me.
What?
I was doing great with Julie before I discovered you.
Hey, I was doing great before you discovered yourself. Do you think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
The point is that I ...
I do not need this now, OK.
It's too late, I'm with someone else, I'm happy.
This ship has sailed.
All right, fine, go ahead and do it, all right Ross.
Beautiful.
Because I do not need your stupid ship.
Good.
Good.

Oh, it's so romantic to send honeymooners.
You know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
All in due time my love.
All in good time.
Oh, shoot!
I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later.
I do not have a key, they took mine to give you.
What?! They took mine to give you!
Why should they take off our keys?
Wow! It seems like we have a lot of good things.
Oh, we did it, but my mother gave us the greatest gift of all.
A
No. He will come with us for eight weeks.
Uh, what?
Yup! It will help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
What ... you're not serious.
I mean she's a very nice woman, but there's no way to take eight weeks.
It will drive us crazy.
Hi Ross!
Hi roomie!

Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I do not know!
It's not like it's porn!
This is a serious and legitimate film.
You know?
And nudity is really important for the story.
This is what you say about porn.
You are right. Maybe I should not even go to the call.
No! No you should! Many main actors make nude scenes! I mean, the possibility of acting in a movie? Come on!
Well, it's true
And I'm naked in one scene only.
It also seems really fantastic.
My character is Catholic and falls in love with this Jewish girl.
Those who escape together and are captured in this great storm.
So we go to this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
It is really sweet and tender.

Hi how are you?
Nothing, Monica and I argued stupidly.
But you're still moving together, right? Because my announcement came out today.
"Wanted, female roommate, non-smoker, not ugly." Beautiful!
Yes?
I just imagined that, after living with you, it would be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, you know?
Someone from whom I can learn, someone, someone different from me.
And what's more different than me? a boy who is

So where are we going next?
This witness will not return my calls, so we'll see if we can surprise him back home.
Sur-surprise? We're not, we're not going to make anyone angry, are we?
Come on man! Listen, uh, are you going to squeeze the perps shoes a bit before lawyers?
He is a witness, not a killer. And nobody talks like that!
Yes, nobody talks like that!
Oh what? Like your mister policeman!
Hey, I'm more a policeman than you two!
How do you understand it?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
I think so.
Here it is. Thank you!
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Oh what, you, do you want them both?
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring ?!
Ok, ok, ok, look, do not be scared, but I lost it.
I know it's in the apartment, but me
Well, what will I say to Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her earrings.
These
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings ?! I'm not allowed to borrow his things!
Why not?
Because I lose his things!

Well, you're sweating.
These are these beads of joy.
Oh, it's sweet. Do not touch me
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Yes!
What is going on?
Chandler's gone again!
My God! Why should you play hide and seek with someone you know is a risk of escape?

All right. Are you ready to push again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Ok, ok, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Yes!!
Little Leslie is here!
We have another one!
Oh my God, I can not believe I have two or two children.
How scary is it?
Come little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come little Chandler! Come on!
All right, it's coming. He's coming!
Hey, where's your thing?
Chandler is a girl!
Oh God, the flashback of the kindergarten.
They have to read the wrong ultrasound.
Because they thought they were a boy, but Chandler is a girl!
Chandler is a girl!
Ok, keep saying!
I'm late ?!
No-no ah, everything's fine. All are healthy, there are 30 fingers and 30 toes.
Do we have our children?
Yes.
Oh, we have our children.

Hey, Toby!
Hey Bobby.
In reality it is Bob. Hey, you work here, you can tell me where Chandler is
Uhh yes Yes, it's true, right there. Right there, yes. Can I ask you why?
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Ok, listen to Bob, I'm the reason you did not get the job here.
Toby no.
Bob!
Toby! I will not let you cover it for him. Whatever you say now will make me madder even more with Chandler!
Ohh!
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! He's so cute!
I know! I found it on the street.
Are you serious, really ?! It is in good condition.
Yes.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
I do not know.
It's moving.
Ew.
It's still - It has a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here !!
Ooh! Ah! All right!

Well, I went to Kyle the other night to collect some things and we got to remember
we talked for most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry with each other was because there were still feelings there. So
Oh, just say Kyle!
We'll do another try.
What about his lament and his constant need for attention ?!
I will work on it.
Oh, right, because you're so capable of changing.
You know, he hums when he pisses!
I know it.
It makes him lose the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
It's all right, we ... we do not need you. In fact, hey, I'm already thinking about it.
Yes, and you know what? I do not give a fuck.
Yes, we will go.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Phoebe, you were, you were right about her. You know, her
Oh. You know, he hums while he does other things.
Yes, we're better without them.
And you know, even if they broke up again, you'd better not leave it in your sad men's club!
Club for divorced men.
Potato, Potaato.

Why did not you come back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you have the keys?
Porsche.
This is totally your fault!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you ripped the paper from the court reporter's car !!
We can, we can only forget that it has never happened?
Yes sure, absolutely! You are right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Yup.
Well, I guess I'm, I'm going to pack.
All right. Oh wait! One more thing, do-do we still need to solve the question of "us?"

Phoebe!
Yes?
Did you see Chandler ?!
No! Why?
The woman in the museum called and said there was a cancellation and we could go to our wedding and Chandler heard!
I know!
How serious is this?
!
Well, for the normal boy, it's ugly, but Chandler, oh my God!
I know! I know! And he is completely out of his mind and I can not find him anywhere!
What will you do?
Well, I'll never listen to you again, that's for sure!
"You know, can you hurt if you go and put down your name?"
Rachel said this!
Well, Rachel is not here!

Come on come on.
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.
This should be, like, the most beautiful day of my life, you know?
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of being locked in a closet with you.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I waited for this as much as you.
No no no, believe me.
Nobody has waited as long as I have, ok?
And you know what's funny?
When this day is over, you can go home with the baby, ok?
Where do you leave me?
You must become the father of the child.
Everyone knows who you are.
Who I am?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's not ... the day of lesbian amateurs.
Every day is the day of lesbian loves.
Is fantastic
Do you want to explain it?
I mean, well, because when I was growing up, you know my father is gone, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole.
And here is this little child who has like three whole parents who worry so much that they are fighting over who will love him more.
And he's not even born yet.
He's alone, he's just the luckiest child in the world.
I'm sorry, you were fighting.

Ok, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just coming out.
Hi, how are you Kelly?
I'm doing well! God, Tiffany, you smell so beautiful!
It's my new perfume. Why do not you approach where you can
Oh, you know, Joey, you're sick!
This is disgusting!
I'm not reading this!
What?! Wait wait wait! The handsome man was about to enter !!

All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
I mean he has a monocle, he has a hat ...
Do you know he's gay?
I just want to clarify this: are you dating Mr. Peanut?
Danielle! Hello! Everyone, it's Danielle, Danielle, everyone.
Hello. Hello.
What are you doing here?
So what?
What?
What is that?
What did he leave you?
What do women like?
What did you leave for another woman who likes women?
Slightly stronger, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma who has not really heard you ...
So what?
My first time with Carol was ...
What?
It was Min e
With Carol? Oh.
So in all your life, you've been alone with one - oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a lot of stuff we could have done tonight!

Hello. Where is everybody?
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to block me: what's wrong?
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, it's a bit 'expired.
Oh no! Why?
Because Carol is a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
My God! I do not believe it! Oh, poor bunny.
I'm an idiot.
I mean, I should have seen it, I mean Carol and I would be outside and she would see a beautiful woman, and, and she would be Ross, look at her, and I would think, God, my wife is strong!
Aw! Hey, do you think Susan's person is her lover?
Well, now I do it !!
I'm sorry.
Seven years.
I mean, we've been together for seven years, she's the only woman I've ever loved and the only woman I've ever ...
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
I will do it.
No you will not.
Look, he knows he did something terrible and I believe him, he's sorry.
But you still have an excuse to do, all right, you have to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Ok, absolutely!
All right.
You got it
Cookie, now you can punch him!
What?!

All right, that's it, I stopped.
What? I did not say anything.
Yes, but this is not the face of a person who trusts a person.
Okay, this is the face of a person who, you know, does not trust a person.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Do you relax? I know what I'm doing. That's how he wears it.
Julie.
What?!
Jody!
Were you with Julie?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were ... doing shopping.
Oh. My God.
Honey, wait. We did it only once. It meant nothing to me.
Yeah, for sure. Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you all the time.
Look, I'm sorry, it's okay.
I never wanted you to find out!
Oh, please, you wanted to be discovered.
That's not true!
Oh, so you just happened to leave it here?
Did it ever occur to you that I could be just so stupid?
Ok, Monica. I just have to know something. You went with her to

Hey!
Yes!
I can not say
Why?!
Why not?
I can not say why it is famous.
Oh my God, who is it ?!
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Ok ok. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my child.
Like Barbara Streisand's husband, James Brolin?
What?! Well, he never told me!

In
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler is worse.
Friend, it must be so nice to remember things like that! I have no memories of past lives.
Of course you do not love him. You're brand new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, we do not tell this story.
Oh come on!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey framed Monica's turkey in the head!
What?! Does Joey have a turkey stuck on his head?
Hey, it's not like it seems.
His

Wendy, we had an agreement! Yes, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was that?
Wendy has been saved. I have no maids.
Oh ... it's too bad. Bye Bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I made plans to go around.
You know, Rachel, when you finished your marriage, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you ... twenty dollars an hour.
Done.

The reactor will burst in three seconds, we'll never make it!
You have to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I will not leave you!
Do not worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a car !!
No you are not! Not to me!
My God.
What?
I'm
Yes, you are fantastic! Ok, let's take it from
No, I mean I was really acting out my ass.
Yes, I thought I was also pretty good.
Oh yes, you're solid. Yes, you're not really me.
You know what? I think it's enough for now. Yes. I do not want to be tried above.
Well!
I will do it without you!
I do not need you or anyone else!
I will do it alone!
You will see!!
you

I can not believe Ross left. It's so sad.
I did not know Ross and you were so close.
We were not, but we had a lesson together. He was an exceptional boy and spoke passionately about science. I always remembered it.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear against it and listening carefully.
I've thought so many times to call him and ask him out. I guess I really lost my chance.
But you did not do it!
I am still alive!!
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.
It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day!
I mean, the fact that you're here means more to me than if this room was full of people!
You're a sick monster, who does it? I can not believe I have a crush on you!
Did you hear it? Kori Weston had a crush on me !!

We will do a quick check.
All right.
So, eight days late eh?
Yes.
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Eh, just a little bit.
You're 80 percent canceled, so you're on your way.
It could still last a bit longer.
If you are anxious, there are some ways to help things together.
Fouls !!
In reality, these are things you can do. Only some home remedies, but in my experience I have found that some of them are quite effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Ok, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
All right.
What's wrong with Emma?
Oh she misunderstood, she thought he was moving to Tulsa.

Whenever you're ready.
Ok, ok, here we are.
Ok, where am I talking, here?
I mean, uh, well, there's a way that seems to offer some acoustic advantage, but ...
Just aim for the collision.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here it is.
You know, I, you know, I can not do it.
Uh, this is too weird
I feel stupid.
So do not do it, all right. You do not have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hi baby. Bye Bye.

Hello!
Oh hello. It's Mark.
Oh.
What? Is it my breath?
Ouch!
Rachel?
Ouch! Ouch!
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. All right?
All right, I know.
All right.
I really do it
Ok, I'll take your coat and then I'll put you in a taxi.
All right. Oh wait, wait ... wait, will not you come with me?
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
All right.
All right?
Thank you. Oww !!!! God!
What?! I know, what's wrong?
I'm sorry, I can not go to the hospital with this aspect.

Pete Becker is going around the ring now. It seems, it's just trying to hear it. Oh, Bruiser is just ...
To run! Drive crazy, rich fanatic!
Oh, I can not watch this.
Take a look, it's winning! Pete is winning!
Really?!
No-o-o !!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going to his favorite area.
Oh! Oh!
Wait, if this is your favorite area, why is it so bad with this?
Well, this is ironic.
Of your last two boyfriends, Richard did not want to have children, and from his appearance, now Pete can not.
Friend, you do not have to brag! We have nothing here !!

Should we tell Rachel that there's an empty private room right next to her?
We could, or we can have sex in it.
Well let me think about this while I take off my pants!
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you were going out with him.
Oh! Oh, I think I'll throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.
What?!
What? I've just imagined that since you're pregnant you will not see people.
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Secondly, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I did not tell him. I did not know if you were telling people. This came back when I thought Kash was still people.
Well, well, do not tell him. Do not tell him. Just let me call ok?
Look at Rachel, I really do not think it's so great
Ok, go and do it! I'll be back on that set! I will meet more actors! I will meet them all!

Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
All right.
She is still there to enjoy her fake party and, ah, it's too late to do the things I had planned, so
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, wait, wait, wait
Tell him to wait!
All right. Wait! Wait!
Emily.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!

Hey. Call me when you arrive. All right?
All right.
I know. You're the type that would not want to make the chip for the handyman.
It does not matter!
No, I_I thought the way everyone was reacting was unfair. I mean you just moved.
I
Jen.
Jen, I know this might sound like a bit. But uh, you'd probably take a cup of coffee sometimes, or
Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?
Oh! My number is there. Call me.
I'll give you a call.
See you later.
All right!
I forgot my card.

Here we are. Ok, get ready.
What?
All right.
Ouch!
Are not you going?
No thanks.
No, Rachel never pisses in public toilets.
Well, they never wrote anything there, you know. So my rule is "no fabric, no crushing". Well, if everyone is going.
No, you know what does not close it because the ... keys ... are in there.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no !!
What is going on?
My lighter is in there!
I promise.
Even if you do not seem to be unable to visit.
Hey, is it, is Chandler here?
No, no it is not.
Guys, Joey just saw Janice kiss her ex-husband.
What? So, what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I was thinking about this and me, I think the best way would be, do not do it.
Joey, you can not keep it for yourself, if you know, you have to tell him.
He will kill him. I mean, he will kill him.
Well, you could wait as long as I go to the dentist, maybe

Hello!
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, oh, just, I was wondering, when you and I broke up, you got the tape that was half of the last episode of
Ah, yes, but now it's me and Susan in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Where is Ben?
He's sleeping.
Ahh. Ooh, it's a ah, is it a bad time?
Umm, yes, actually, Susan will be home any minute, it's a bit of an anniversary.
Oh! I thought you were married, January?
It's not that kind of anniversary.
Ah! Oh.
It was so !! Anyway...
Where will we find a small hat?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll have "The Rain Bear" !!
Why will you know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed though.
From. From.
All right.
Oh!!
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath here today.

Please. It's your fault.
How, how is my fault?
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you arrived.
Yes? Well, there are a lot of things Carol has never done before I arrived.
Are you trying to be smart? A funny woman?
Do you know what your problem is? You are threatened by me.
Oh, am I threatened by you?
Yup.
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's all!
Enter here.
Come on.
My god, you guys, I do not believe you.
There are children who come into the world in this same building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should hear.
So just stop all the screams, just stop it!
Yes, Susan.
Do not let me do it again, I do not like my voice like this.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?

Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I did not! Who would have done it?
Son of a bitch!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Oh, did not I talk? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
You know sometimes good ideas are right in front of you, right?
Ok, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it could work. You know? The only problem is that Carl's acting is
The
Yes, that's the reason why I did not grow so big
Hey, can I have a piece of that cake?
Pizza!! We like pizza !! Go out!!!

Hey Monica, is there a customer who wants to complete the chef, should I let him in?
Of course, I love this part!
Come inside.
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment, yes.
But only right now. So you want to kiss again?
Of course, the New Year is only two weeks. It can wait?
No.
Me neither.
3, 2,
Joey, you do not have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yes, okay I just thought I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.

Wow ... Wow!
Yes.
Alright. Phoebe?
Ok ok.
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would like, um, peace in the world, no more hunger, good things for the rainforest ... And the biggest tits!
Yes, see ... you took mine. Chandler, and you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I would be omnipotent forever.
See, there's always a boy. "If I had a wish, I would like three more wishes".
Hey, Joey. Hello. Hello Friend.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
I probably kill myself!
..I'm sorry?
Hey, if Little Joey is dead, then I have no reason to live!
Joey, uh-
you

I'm sorry.
Joey, on stage!
Well, can you at least stay until the end of the game?
I mean, I'll go to the airport with you, I'll say goodbye.
Where are you Vic?
The flight lasts one hour. I have to go.
Vic! Vic!
In a minute !!
So this is it? Winner?
Yes, I guess it is.
Listen, I, ah, I have to say hello, and ... and I have to say it quickly because it's killing me.
One thing you need to know is that I will never forget you.
But you have things you have to do now, and me too.
So I'll go on this spaceship, and I'll go on Blargon 7 looking for alternative fuels.
But when I come back, in 200 years, you'll be gone for a long time.
But I will not have aged at all.
So you tell your great-grandmother to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I want to meet her.
So long, Vic!

I have to say
Via Nooo! The most romantic song that has ever been
See, I_I think what Elton John wrote, um, that guy
What song was that, Phoebe?
Hi Monica!
Hey Mon!
Hey Mon!
Oh my God, did you sleep?
No.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Yes, he finally stopped crying yesterday, but then he found one of Richard's cigar stubs on the terrace, then.
Oh, okay, that explains.
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this loud, creaky sound, so I thought it was okay like a mouse or an opossum.
But then I understood where a mouse or an opossum would get the money to make the phone call.

So, buddy, are you going to play with me tonight?
You know what, I do not know how much I'll feel comfortable to see how hot the sex is between a boy and your girlfriend.
Yes, I know but
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
Hey!
Hey Mon! Do you want some pancakes?
Did you make pancakes?
Yup! Take a plate.
All right.
No-no, stay there. Approach.
Ok, ok, but do not worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,
Listen, we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come here.
Oh yeah!

Yes, if the hole was sandwiched.
Yes, the hero's sandwiches.
Well, you all know I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in the war in any way.
But you know what?
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.
Not you Joey.

Oh my good God
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite dishes. Tonight, n. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut hot dogs.
Look, you've done enough! All right? You have to stop it now.
I will do it! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you gave me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
The way you look like tonight
You're just the sweetest.
No! You're the sweetest!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
What?
I'm checking the restaurant with Pete.
Oh, Monica, I'm so excited for you.
Wait wait wait! Wait!!

So honey, this threesome, umm, I mean how-how will you start to find
Ooh, I actually made a list of all the women I know who could do this!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone did their homework.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is there twice, but it's true
Oh I know. You know, just ... just talking about it is making me a little sick
Oh me too.

and then, we could have gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Ross, it would not have been possible.
But having a dove to place the ring on the finger would not have been a problem?
It was really fun to be married to you tonight.
Yes! IS! And it was the easiest $ 400 I've ever done.
Okay Ross, I can, uh, can I ask you something?
Yes.
That proposal, to the planetarium
I know, I know it was stupid.
Are you kidding?!
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!
It was really wonderful!
Did you just make it up?
No, I actually thought about it when, when we were going out.
That's how I imagined I'd ask you to marry me.
Well, it would have been very hard to say no.
It's a good thing I did not do it, because it looks like it would have been a very expensive wedding. OK Goodnight
Good night
Even if the sidecar had a windshield so the hair did not get messed up?
I'll think about it.
That's all I'm asking for

You guys! They were bananas, cream and beef! I - I can not believe you ate it so you do not feel bad!
In fact, I-I did not eat mine. It is still in the bathroom.
No, it's not, I ate it.
Well, we left ours in Monica's room.
No, I understand and I have yours too.

Okay, we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mother and father, and I really do not know what happened with that.
And I'm so happy there are no problems.
All right, I'm actually in the hiring committee, so there will be at least one friendly face.
Ohh! Is fantastic!
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the
Really?!
No-ho-ho!
Yes.
I mean, no-no-no-no-no, do not worry, I'm sure that with your qualifications you will not need to sleep with a guy to get that job.
Although, I may need some conviction.
Good, me, umm
Making fun of! God, I feel wild today!

My God! Chandler just left!
Yes, but maybe that's not what we think. Maybe it's telling Monica that I'm sorry I drank the last milk.
Or maybe he - he was writing to tell him - that he changed his name, you know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I think it means that he went out of his mind and left!
Do not be so negative! Good God! Is not it possible that Sorry is sitting in there now?
All right. Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What we will do?
Look, okay, I will, I'll have to go look for him and bring him back!
All right?
You - make sure that Monica does not find out, ok?
All right.
All right
I will do it, I will find it.

Hey!
Hello! Hey!
Guys, do you know any cute guys?
Well, of course I do it! My good friend Joey here.
Oh sorry. Thanks Chandler.
However, there is this great charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren has bought a table, so I have to go
What is the charity?
I do not know, something that is tree or disease ... Ralph mumbles a lot.
Ralph mumbles when you're not paying attention?
Yes! It's strange. But the thing is need to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Hey!
What are you guys doing next?
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get my hair cut.
We do?
I want to see what he wants first.
All right.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! Are not you Elizabeth's dad ?!
Come on guys, I ... I really want this guy to like me.
It would really help if you guys were here to make me look good.
Obviously we will help you! Yes! We will be here!
Thank you!
We know how difficult those parent / teacher conferences can be.

Oh hello! How are you doing?
I'm fine. I have to go to the police station and look at the mug shots.
Oh.
Thanks for finishing me, guys.
Label?
Y-Are you going?
We did not, and we did not have the chance to talk.
Uh, so, where did you say you come again?
Colorado.
Ah, what's the use?
Listen, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
All right.
Ah, I-I should never have said what I said.
Hey, you know what?
It does not matter how I feel.
I mean we work together, so nothing could ever happen between us, and what I'd like to do is go to work on Monday and ... and never talk about it again, okay?
Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I knew it, I scared you.
No you did not. The only thing that scared me was that you said nothing would ever happen between us.
Really?
Yes, so please do not dismiss me for doing so.
Ok, well, this is one less thing we have to do on Monday.

Take it! GET! Take it! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, you're a friend!
See friend, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!
It's open!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!

I'm so glad I held this chair for me!
Yes me too.
Hey, how's the miracle chair?
Beautiful.
Yes? Wow! You know, this thing has speakers in the headrest!
No, really?
Yes! You can connect it to your TV
My chair is taken care of.

Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study last night?
Yup! Yes i did it.
So do Iceberg!
G-sharp.
sol
What?! I did not touch a guitar!
No, but you're questioning my method!
No, I'm not questioning, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
Thank you.
You know, none of my other students thought I was stupid.
Your other student, it was you!
Yeah, well, you know, maybe you just need to try a little more!
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Right here!
Here!
Andy Cooper, teaches guitar and looks at ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little boy and
Well! Go to learn from your qualified instructor! But do not come crying to me when everyone is tired and tired of hearing you play
"The worst man in the whole damn city."
Oh good! Take his part!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey has to work. Now let's go!
Hey!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have it back when the five pages are finished! Ahh!

Hello!
Hello.
Hello. Umm, I think there's something we really need to talk about.
I think we do it. Why do not we enter? Look uh, I know why you're here.
You do?
Yes, and to save you from any embarrassment, I think maybe I should talk first.
All right.
All right. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. This was a devil of a swing is not it?
What?
I mean, look, that ... that night we had fun and definitely passionate, but do not you think it's better if we're friends?
Seriously. What?!
All right.
All right.
You know what?
If you wish, we can do it again.
I mean, I'd agree with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.
Ok, you know what? Can I, can I speak now?
Oh sure.
I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Ok, when you're ready. And you're the father, by the way ... but you understood it

We should play football provocatively more often. Maybe there's a similar league we could join or something like.
I know!
Yup! Wow, well, that was easy. Okay, you-go.
All right.
All right.
Okay, you know, you know when you're in bed with a woman.
Mah.
And, ah, you know, you're joking with her.
And you have all these mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl in Xerox's place.
With the navel ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, and then suddenly your mom comes to mind.
And you like 'Mom, get out of here!'
You know, but of course, later, you can not think of anything else, and you can not, you know, stop doing what you're doing.
So it's a bit like, you are, you know it.
You know ... you do not know!
Your mum, what are you telling me, are you telling me about your mother, what's wrong with you?
You said...
I said '

Oh!
Look at Emma!
I can not decide who looks more like you or Rachel?
Oh, what are you kidding? It's beautiful, it's all Rachel.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why are not you two together yet?
I do not know.
I know, because you're not in that place.
Which would be good, except you are totally.
It's complicated okay?
Yes, it's true. Yes, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no correct answer.
Look, we were together.
All right?
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.
It's only if, if we get together again and it does not work, I could never do it to Emma.
I mean she-she thinks everything- Oh, that's me.
What do they put something in the water in this place?
Since Rachel and I are really doing it, we're doing really good now.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you could ruin it.
Yes exactly.
Right. Or you could get everything you wanted when you were fifteen.

God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have
You do not have a
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just have to relax, okay? I just need to relax, okay? I just need to relax
What-what are you doing ?! You're fine, it's not funny! Stop riding!
I'm not kidding, okay? I'm walking around.
Uh Oh.
Ok, stay calm. Nothing will happen to you, you're not in trouble.
Really? Do you think so?
I was talking to myself! You're going down!

Hey honey! I missed you today!
Oh yeah?
Yes. What do you want to do tonight?
Oh, well ... Maybe we could ...
Ok, trying to light me up by messing up?
Know your audience!
Also, tomorrow we are doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep the tadpoles in the tank.
Do we really need to take those tests?
Honey, we're trying to have a baby for over a year.
I think it's a good idea to find out if it's all right. Just some routine tests.
But I do not want to do it in a cup!
Oh, bye Max! Hey, do you know everyone?
No. Did you see David?
No, no, it was not around.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack up. Let's go to Minsk.
Minsk?
Minsk. It is in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
So when, when are you leaving?
First of January.

Did you want to see Professor Geller?
Yes, yes! Please come in.
Oo-oo!
Pretty awesome! Except I had a little attitude on the part of the robot.
Damn those robots, they should be ours
In any case, it was not the robot, it was the boy who controlled it.
Yes, he does not like me.
He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
turn down the sandwich just when I reached one!
Ohh!
Well, why do not you fire him?
Maybe I'll have to, I hate doing it, but I'm the star!
You know?
There is a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat from the floor.
I'm sorry.
Joey Tribbiani.
Joe! I'm glad to have found you, I had an audition for you!
Wow!
The fact is that it is a little bit about Q.T.
The actor who plays the part does not know he could be fired.
He is the protagonist of a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I'm the main character in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!
Uh Oh!

Oh good God! If you want a child so bad, just steal it!
What's happening to you? Since when are you so crazy for children?
I'm not crazy for children. I'm crazy about us.
What?
Listen, we've always talked about having children one day.
I'm not saying it should be right now, but I'm starting to think we can handle it.
They were good.
We are really good.

Oh, did you get it ?!
Uh Huh.
WH-What did he say?
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda." Well, of course I could not give him my real name?
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw how it ended up here!
What do you think?
He will stop and talk with his daughter who has left!
What did you tell him?
Well, I said, I told him I was the executor of Francis's will and that I needed to talk to him, so I'll meet him at the cafe later.

Oh yes, of course.
Ok, in about ten seconds you'll see him kiss me.
And in about five seconds you'll see why.
Did Ross ever tell you about when I went backpacks around Western Europe?
Ok, get ready to see a little bit of beggin!
Oh, you came to Ross!
What?!
Now I'm so happy.
What are you talking about?!
You used the history of Europe!
This is the magical story you use when you want to have sex!
How do you know about that story?
How can I do
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from a guy!
Someone!!
No. No, he told me that his name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams !!

How are we, guys ready?
Mum has already called this morning to remind me not to put on my hair. Did you know that my ears are not my best feature?
Some days is all I can think of.
Hello, sorry I'm late, I could not find the orientation.
Oh ... ok, fine.
But ... um ...
I have only one question for you, um ...
When we go out, walk, run, say hello or walk ...
Stop it, stop it! Speak slow but could pee quickly! OK let's go!!

I can not believe! How far has it gone?
Well, Alexandra was
Oh, has a name?
Phoebe, do not be angry!
Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on, Chandler, let's go!
Well, Phoebe I thought I would ... Yes, what the hell.

Well!
Oh that's good. Maybe he will hear you and he will pull the cord.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Are you sure you did not break it because it really hurts?
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry!
Hey!
Hey!
I took my s!
That we can celebrate later.
To celebrate.

Ok, Paulo, why do not you go get dressed, and then go your way, ok, bye bye.
Rachel, how did it happen?
I do not know, I just ran into him last night.
Where is it?
In his apartment. Is this juice?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you downloaded him because he hit Phoebe?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
I licked my arm, what?
It is breast milk.
So?
Phoebe, this is the juice, squeezed by a person.
what's the problem?
What have you just done?
Ok, people would stop drinking breast milk?
You will not even taste it?
No!
Even if you only pretend it's milk?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child.

Aww!
It is funny.
Hey Phoebe, could you please do not put my feet on my new old sheet?
Oh sure! Noo!
Ohh !!
My pharmacy table !!!
What?!
Noooooo !!
Ross, where did you get it ?!
I understood
Oh my God, Phoebe,
Wow! Oh my God, well if they have torn our table our must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Oh yes.
Well, this does not even smell like opium.
Of course not, it smells like wine, you've overthrown! And thank you for destroying my paper by the way.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.

Like her?
It's too early to say. It's resting, which is a good sign.
How are your hair?
I will not lie to you, Ross, it does not look good.
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped curling.
Can we see it?
Your hair looks too beautiful, I think it would upset her. Ross, why do not you come inside.
Yes.
How are you?
Obviously the package appeals to adults and children.
Ross, you're stupid. I tried it, it's not a big deal. Tasting it
That would be no.
Come on. It does not have a bad taste.
Yes, it's a bit sweet, like ... uh ...
Melon juice.
Exactly.
Did you taste it? You tasted it.
Uh Huh.
Oh, you tasted it.
You can go on saying it, but it will not stop being true.
Give me the bottle. Give me the towel.

I still do not understand why Greg and Jenny give us a false number.
You know, if they knew what they were doing, they probably did not even give you real names.
Ok, maybe people give false numbers, but they do not give false names.
Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Queen Philange.
I still do not understand, we did not do anything wrong.
I know! Even if you've told a lot of jokes.
I thought you said those jokes were fun. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
Well, maybe they were all your questions.
And my questions?
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot that itches like crazy.
Oh, I understand that.
Wow! I can usually get to know a girl a little better before you leave me a spoon.
Relax, it's not like we're bifurcating.

Look at him! Ohhh! The wallpaper is a little faded, all right. The carpet is a bit slow. Solid wood floors !!
Hey!
Hello.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
I know!!!
So, I'm here, ready to play.
All right.
I've brought some stuff for the house, so take a look. Ha-ha.
What is this?
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Not one who can pee on the roof.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
And this is in case the house sneezes?
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
I do not want a ghost.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you have it, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian cemetery.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste and an ancient Indian cemetery? It would never happen.
Ok, obviously you do not know much about the US government.
Hey!
Hello.
I need to talk to you!
Of course, what's up?

All right, I just changed in thirty seconds so I could be alone with him. You'd better look for it.
Please, I'm not going to anything.
Well, if you do not, I will.
Please, do you want to go?
I would like to!
Hey, guys, guys, have you seen my new china cabinet ?!
Uh Huh.
Look look.
Ooohhhh !!
And e!
Ahhhh !!
Hey, my father's house does it!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Well, the film was great, the dinner was great and there's nothing better than a cold and buzzing evening in New York.
Hmm.
Of course, I did not like anything about it, because Joanna is like that

All right. It's Emma.
Emma! To see? I do not want it
Take it.
What?
It is clearly an emma.
Oh honey, but you love that name.
Yes, but I love you more.
Besides, you know, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.
I mean Oh, bye Emma.
Yes its you.
You're our little Em.
Oh what is that honey?
What?
Oh, do you want a little cousin?
Do you want a cousin right now?
!

Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, charlatan!" I'm happy all the time!
Good try.
Wait wait wait!
Look, Monica
Look!
This will not work.
I bet it will work!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
Anything! I said, I said "You're so beautiful" and then I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can not believe!
No I did not!
Yes, you did it!
No I did not!
You love Me!
No I do not! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that!

Hi Greg?
Hi, is this Monica from the plane?
Listen, the number you gave me 853-5 This is their old number!
Jenny has given us since they moved!
Jenny! It's so Jenny!
Hey, listen, how would you like to be together?
Say next Saturday?
Ok, what about Sunday?
All right, the week after?
The week after?
Do you know what Greg?
You know what?
We are good, interesting, fun people with

Hey, Chandler! Do you know what a girl you went to college with who-who became a director?
Oh yes, Dana Keystone. He was in my movement class.
What is a movement class?
It's Chandler's way of pretending not to take mimicry.
Oh well listen, anyway he's directing the new film by Al Pacino. You have to audition me!
Oh, I do not know the man. I did not talk to her in ten years.
I'm.
Joey, what are you talking about? You are an exceptional actor.
Do you really think that?
Uh, how can you even ask that question ?!

Ross! Give it a try. (He's carrying a problem of
Oh, ok, I'm doing another one!
This also does not hurt ... Ooh, yes, it does!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ooh!
Oh, I was hoping it would be like that.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel?
All right. Hey, but better to make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the camera? Beautiful!!

Yes I love you. OK Bye! Hello!
Hello!
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. It should be here by now!
Oh, honey, do not worry. He will do it in time.
Yes.
I guess I set up the camera to try and seduce Joey.
But unfortunately I could not be enticed.
Unbelievable! I mean, did you really take Joey's underwear ?! Why? Why should you do it ?!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I chase guys and keep their underwear.
Well, I think we all learned something about who is disgusting and who is not.
Eh?
All right, now, I'm going back to my bucket.
I eat only the skin, so the chicken is up for grabs.

I did not find anything from Joey - Hey-hey, oh hey!
Oh, okay, they gave you the old times prices.
Yes.
Well, what period does it come from?
Uh, it's a long time ago. Like the times of a time. You know?
Yes yes I do it.
God, oh it's just perfect!
Wow!
I bet he also has a great story behind him.
Did they say anything to you?
As you know where it came from
Yup! As far as I know, this is from White Plains.
White plains. Oh, it seems such a magical place.

So, do not you still think I'm the boyfriend's material?
Eh?
I saw you watching me during the game last night.
I, umm, shut up!
"Hello, Phoebe and Ursula." I'll miss you. "Post scriptum Your mother lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Well, it's practically the essence. Good, except for the poem. Read the poem, right?
Noooo !!
All right, wait!

Rachel, it will happen. Chandler will move here.
But I
No-no, wait!
Just let me finish, ok?
This is not something we just have, we just impulsively decided in Vegas, this is something we both really want.
And it
IS? Really?
Yes sweetie.
I mean we're not, will not we live together anymore?
No.
What? My God! I will miss you a lot!
I'll miss you!
I mean, it's the end of an era!
I know!

Why are all the cups of coffee you have on the bottom?
Oh. That's how Monica can keep track. This way if one of them is missing, she can be like, 'Where is the number 27?!'
You know what?
It was not so.
Ok, so what you had with Rachel is what I have with Alice.
Now, wh-what, how is it?
It's so beautiful, it's like that, it's just because being with her is much better than not being with her.
Yes, yes.
Why can not I find it?
Do not ask me, I had it and I blew it up!
Well, I want it!
You can have it!
I do not know, maybe I can not. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Oh, no! No!
Man is out there! I saw it! I got it!!
So keep it tight !!
All right, man!
All right, congratulations, lucky bastard!

Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
To push!
Push them out, push them out, stronger, stronger.
Push them out, push them out, go!
We take that ball and we really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
Come on- I was alone ... yes, right.
To push!
To push!

All right.
Ross, did not you say there was an elevator here?
Uhh, yes, I did it, but it's not there. Ok, here we are.
All right, go left. Left! Left!
Ok, you know what? There is no left, left!
Oh ok, lift it straight over your head!
Straight over your head!
You can do it!
You can do it!
All right.
You got it right?
Oh, ok, I understand.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just that I never even do it
Howard is the
Yes, but I'm alone too, my friend.
Ok, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ugh, can you believe it?
Yes. I really like your glasses.

Ohh!
What?
He kicked! I think the kid kicked!
My God!
Oh no wait, oh no, the rubber band on my underwear broke.
My God! I overslept! I had to be on set half an hour ago! I have to get out of here!
Oh wait, Joey, you can not go that way! You stink!
Look, I know I'm asleep before I can take a shower and now I have no time!
I'm only ten blocks away, if I run, I can do it.
You're coming across the room! I'm Chandler.
Hello.
Hello.
You're sorry if I do
No Please.
So, what are you working on?
I speak in my sleep
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
So why do not you give me your number?

Previously on Friends.
I do not know exactly. It's ... it's like fighting.
Oh?!
Yes, but without the costumes.
Oh.
And it's not false, it's totally brutal.
Yes, they're two guys in a ring, and the rules are: "They are
So you can love, bite and pull people's hair and things?
Yes, anything goes, except ah, eye creaking and catching fish.
What is fish hooking?
Huh, what's hooking fish ... Thanks friend, it would have been really hard to describe. What is this taste?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just had a duck bath.

Oh, Bob, it was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to not scream your name.
Well, this makes me feel so good.
It was just so embarrassing and bumpy.
Bumpy?
Well, maybe he had a kind of new, beautiful style that is not familiar to you.
And maybe you have to get used to it.
Well, there was not really much time to get used to, you know what I mean?

Crossing! Oh! Crossing! Oh! Hello! Hello! No! Right! Crossing!
Oh well, it's not that bad.
Yes, most of the damage is quite contained in the bedrooms.
Oh!
My God!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
I'm sorry?
Joey! Is working! You would look
Oh, how bad is it?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that is not burned is a donkey. What do I do
How's your room, Rach?
Everything is ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
It's not mine?
Well! Sorry for your loss!
So, you will not be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Wow! Oh, ok, look, man, I am
Yes, they can stay with us.
Did you understand what started Mr. Mr. Fireman?
There is so much pressure.
I do not mean offense, but what you guys do is very different.
I do not know if you would understand.
Yes, none of us has to deal with the pressure on our work.

Well, Phoebe, we have to do something!
Well you know.
I mean, there's no way Joey can make it in time.
So I will go through the hotel and see if there are any other marriages going on.
All right. Oh, but do not tell them that Monica is pregnant because they curl up on that.
All right.
All right.

What's all this for you guys who fight ?! Is it really over a room ?! I mean, it's so silly!
Ross, we can handle it.
Well, apparently not, and I can not just stand and watch two people who I feel very bad about something that's so silly.
I mean, enough of stupidity!
Well, why do not you tell her to stop being silly!
Ok ok!
Two good points, look, I've known you for a long time, and I've never seen any of you two million people as happy as you've been since you were together.
Do you really want to throw everything away on a room?
It's so silly.
Now, what is more important, love or nonsense?
Well, we like nonsense, but we also have a soft spot for love.
Love is the best medicine.
This is a laugh.
Why are you doing it?
I do not know.
All right! All right! Now, Chandler, you want to live with Monica, right?
Yes I do it.
And Mon, you want to live with Chandler, right?
Yup.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!

Oh.
But not me. Me, Phoebe.
Well, I'm not at all surprised that they feel that way.
You're not? See, that's why you're so exceptional!
In reality it is, it is enough, you know, a typical behavior when you have this type of dysfunctional group dynamics.
You know, this kind of co-dependent, emotionally tired, sitting in your stupid cafeteria with your stupid cups that, I'm sorry, might even have nipples on them, and you're like everything 'Oh, define me!
Definiscimi!
Love me, I need love!
'.

Have you done it before?
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Take only a big, big swing.
Now do not hold back.
and Phoebe takes a wooden baseball bat and starts swinging as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Hey!
Hey Hey Hey!
What are you doing?
We're just celebrating that Joey has returned her health insurance.
Oh alright.
Yes! Sure! Yup! Oh, you know what? If I heard a shot now, I would throw my body on you.
Oh yeah? Well, maybe you and I should take a walk in a bad neighborhood.
All right!
All right.
Hello!
Hello!
Cut out Ross! I hate having to save your life and kick your ass the same day!

Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yes.
Listen, I'd prefer it if you did not call me Joey.
Since I do not know anyone here, I thought it would be nice to try a nickname of cool work.
Hey, dragon! Here are your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There is as if there were 300 dollars in this!
Yes, people become quite generous during the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight pants.
All right.
Waiters could gather around to hear tonight's specials?
Ok, first there is a Chilean sea bass prepared with a mango flavor on an envelope: why is not anyone writing them?
Because we can remember them.
Why will everything end up making fake specials and getting me to cook like you did last night?

Hey. When you guys are kids and you played
I've always been Joanne.
Question. It was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighborhood?
Ewww! Oh! He is the king of mattresses!
Booo !!
Do not look at honey. Change channel! Change channel!
Wait! Wait! I want to see it. After I have divorced him, half of that kingdom will be mine.
What a saw!
Oh, I can not believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I know!
And four ninety-nine for a pillow top set, who cares about the divorce, those kids will sell themselves.
And I'm upset about you by the way.

You had to do it, right? You can not leave it alone.
Four percent It's fine. I recommend more than that when there is an insect in my food.
Ross, it was two of you who got along tonight. Oh, you would only see my chiropractor, yes.
Yes, I go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Phoebe, what are you doing?
I'm, I'm going crazy!
Monica believed me with something and she should not have!
All right, I have not lived here for a while, so I have to ask you something.
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Um. Yes.
I'm
Okay, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is solvable, if we act quickly, okay.
So, I will invite him to do a brunch tomorrow and you can enjoy it.
Look, honey, I tried to make it nice, it does not work.
Ok, look, Ross, I realize my father is hard, but that's why you have to be the biggest man here.
You feel sweetness, I could be the biggest man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge giant man, and it would not make any difference, except I could take your father and say 'I like me!
Like me, little doctor!
Ok, well, can not you try Ross again? For me? For me?
Rachel, a brunch will not solve anything. You have to face it, okay, we'll never get along.
Ok, well, you'll do it too, okay.
Because I already have a mother and a father who can not be together in the same room, ok, I do not want to have a separate room for you too!
!
Ok, ok, ok I'll take the bagels.

Okay, Joey, you know that since you're returning all this stuff right after the audition, will you have to wear underwear?
Okay, so you'd better show me a little bit then too.
Ok, something is missing. Ooh, I know! Umm, ok
Really? A bag?
It is not a bag! It is a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's purse.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all men wear them in the spring catalog. Look. Look,
Look,
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.
No! No Joey! Unisex.
Well, I will not say no to this.

So, did you tell your parents?
No, but everything will be fine, they are very nice, my brother is so sincere. . .
Here it is.
You know one thing, I only have one more question, er, if you had understood it before, er, I'd been around, you think I'd be the one.
.
.
no, um, I'm sorry, do not tell me, I do not think any of the two answers would make me feel better.
I love you Phoebe.
So your brother is right? Seriously.

Hey!
Hello.
I just came to not release anything. So that weekend made me sick, eh?
Yes, he did it.
So, I guess it's over.
What?
Well, you know, you and I, we had to finish sooner or later.
Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Chandler who is crazy!
If you give up every time you argue with someone you'll never be with longer than-Ohhh!
So, this is not over?
You are so cute!
No.
No, it was a fight.
You're dealing with it and move on!
It's nothing strange.
Really? All right. Great!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
Are we in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.
All right.

Hello!
So you like short hair better.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Can I tell you a little secret?
Yes!
I want to keep one.
Ohh, I'll be on the news!

Oh please.
What? Honey.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I know.
Ow !!
Oh God!
Hey guys! Guess what?
Do you have a job on a boat on the river?
You know what I did not wear this suit for a year because I hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so ...
Oh I understand, so this dress is making a point.
Right.
Now that you are your property, you are free to look stupid as you like.
Do you like it, do not you?
Oh absolutely. I like even more about you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Yes, come here!
What ... what did you want to tell us?
Yes. Oh! Did you invent the cotton gin ?!
Ok, goodbye!

Hey, I got one! I got one!
Hello!
Hello.
Oh uh, up or down?
Oh down, please. I-I hate being a ball player can I do it?
Could you please press also?
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg too.
Oh yeah? How did yours happen?
Well, it's a long story.
It's a bit embarrassing.
Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
And you?
Car crash.
Oh.
Oh, let me guess that an idiot on the phone was not paying attention?
Yeah. Me. Oh hey, it's me. Hey, I'll take it, you're just visiting someone.
Uh-huh, yes.
Well, if you sometimes know and maybe you might want to visit someone else
Oh yeah! I would like ... I'd like to.
I'm in the middle
Wait! What?! No!! Lift!! No!
Uh, you have to press the button.

Oh, we did it, and you still have all your lamps.
Oh, I did not calculate the room tax.
Oh man, do not worry, I found a waitress's car unattended. We are far ahead of the game.
My God.
What?
There is something new in the bowl.
Look, we have enough, just go away.
No, but I want ... I want the pine cones!
There is a forest right outside.
It's not the same.
Ok, go fast!
Thanks for a lovely stay.
Oh, my maple candies!

Oh my God, what happened?
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He ... pulled me ... the ... bed!
Wow! Turning looks like fun.
Oh, I'd like to. No, you know he was just trying out the Ross Hug & Roll thing.
Ross's what?
You know what, where he hugs you and makes you roll away and ... Oh ... my ... God.

Ops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Yup!! Yup! Yup! Yup!! That's my dad, that's Frank! Yes! I'm sorry that I enjoy everything.
Go easy - if you want, there are cookies on the counter or, or - sangria! I can make sangria!
No-no, I'm sorry. The cookies are good, thanks.
Oh.
Well, umm, anyway, I was, I looked for my father, um, did you hear something from him or did you see him?
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I think we lost everyone's knowledge after high school.
Oh ok. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Ohh, good. We knew we were always together, in fact we had a nickname for the three of us.
Oh what? What was that?
The three losers.
Oh, poor Lily.
Oh, you know, I ... I heard about what happened, it must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother like that.
Yes, no, it was great.

Well, we've already tried to feed it, to change it, to burp it, oh try this!
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Well, here's something, say try to hold the baby close to your body and then swing it quickly from side to side.
Ok.
It worked!
Oh oh no, I just stopped for a little puke.
Oh come on, what will I do, hours have passed and will not stop crying.
Umm, she Rach, it's not true, her.
Yes, I'm not so sure.
Oh my God, I'm losing my mind.
Yes, I'm not kidding, this shows that it's not good to have sex with Ross!

Well, you're not.
Oh, it's so easy for you, I mean, you're not married, you can have sex with whoever you want!
Yes I can! And do not think that I do not do it, because I do it! I mean all the time, do you know?
Monica. You did it, did you do well?
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm a 30 year old virgin?
My God! You are a virgin of 30 years!
Say it louder, I do not think the boy has heard you all the way!
It's not like, I have no chance.
I mean, you know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
I'm seeing this guy, Roger, all right?
It's not perfect, but I think maybe I should do it.
You know, give it my flower.
My God!! Just do it!! Honey, you waited
You know what? You are right?!
Yup!!
I mean that sex does not have to be a big deal!
There should not be all these rules and restrictions!
You know, people should be able to sleep with whoever they want, every time
Rachel! I'll never think it's right for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!

Push pushing!
They were here!
Where have you been?
Long story, honey.
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need ... Excuse me, could I have this?
Come on then.
Behind the shoulders of my brother? ... it's exactly the kind of crazy thing you will not hear from me.

So, I heard, you hate me!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about this.
A little bird told me something about you that would rip your arm and throw it at me.
And do you have a 'hate' from that ?! You're making a big jump there ...
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, we have to do something for our little situation here, Joey.
So, this is my idea: you and I spend some time together.
But what will you do ...
For Chandler!
Guess, I auditioned!
Awww, one of my students auditioned. I'm so proud.
I was wondering if you would have thought to instruct me for this?
You bet! What is the part?
Oh, it's great, it's a role

Hello! Hello! Hello. He umm, has anyone seen Chandler?
I thought it was with you.
He ... he was with me, um, we're playing a little game, you know? Hide and seek.
You can not ask, son, it's a cheat.
You're right, thank you for keeping me honest father.
Well, it's better if you do not come here. He can not see the bride with the wedding dress.
As I remember when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
But that was after the wedding, it is not bad luck.
Honey, it's not good luck.
My God! Monica!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler?
Great. It's going great. Do not worry about Chandler.
Are you OK?
Uh Huh.
Yeah baby!
I'm really glad you guys are okay, but I keep thinking about what would happen if ... if you two really got hooked.

So, we did well at the strip club, right?
Oh yes, it was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress is sacking to teach the third grade!
I can not believe! He has not called yet.
Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
What, he does not like Josh?
No I do not know.
All right, I'm about to put my sweats back on.
Oh no!
Wait!
Wait!
Okay, you know what, you were right, you were right.
We were not really good at being boys, but do you know why?
Because we are girls.
Phoebe, his music could not
Thank you thank you.
Yes, I lost it.
You know, I will not play anymore, do you want, can you finish my set?
After that? Yes! No, I mean if I can help.
Yes, how could I
What?
I played bad guys on purpose.
Ok, so you were trying to play bad all this time.
Yes, no, just that last song.

Oh, I was thinking of having people for the game.
Oh yes, who is playing?
The players.
Someone seems to miss being the landlady.
Please, it is a relief what it is, it is what it is.
All right, take your plate out!
Oh.

Nothing?
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he did not hear from him again. I-I-I talked again with Chandler's parents!
Did you tell them that he was missing?
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Sure enough, they both think I'm interested in them.
Whose is it?
I do not want to say
Oh come on! I do not care! Come on! Whose is it?
Diane Keaton.

Phoebe! Come on! Here we go! Come on! Why are not you still dressed?
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check it.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you something, if you get ready now I'll let you play at the wedding.
Really?!
Oh, it's so exciting!
Thank you!
Thanks Mon!
Oh, but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to fight you a bit.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
All right.
I will take all the others, finally we can start to celebrate my- I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past.

My best shoes, so good with me.
I wear them every day.
Down at the heel, holes in the toes.
It does not matter what people say.
The best friends of my feet, friends until the end.
With them I'm a hot girl.
Although late at night, little light, I ....
I got into something icky.
The sticky shoes, the sticky shoes always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I will .... I avoid the ..... pillleeeee.

God, it will be so strange when I come home and you're not here.
You know?
Not anymore Joey and Chan.
No more J and C.
"Do you want to go to Joey and Chandler?"
"I can not, it's not there."
Look, I'll be on the other side of the corridor, we can still do all the same things.
Yes, but we will not be able to get up in the middle of the night and make those long chats about our feelings and the future.
We did not do it once.
Hello.
Hey!
Hello.
So, I told Rachel we'll be just the two of us.
Oh yeah? Well, how did you get it?
Very well. Yes. Surprisingly well. Yes, he did not cry. She was not angry or sad.
Uh Huh.
I'm not going to do it.

Ok, if you need the suction, it's in my closet on the left side. Ah, the trash bags are next to the refrigerator
Ok, okay, but Rachel will be here too, can not I ask you these things?
Yes, okay, try it!
All right! Let's do it!
Woo-hoo !!
Yes, cheerie-o!
Little London!
Hello!
Hello!
Monica? What time is it?
Uhh, 9.
But it's dark.
Well, it's because you're always sleeping at noon, silly! Here's how it looks like 9.
I guess I'll be washed up then. Look at that dawn.
I'm
I also know.
Hey!
Do you know what happens if we left for a whole weekend?
You know, we would not have interruptions and we could stay naked all the time.
All weekend? It's all naked.
Yes, I can say that I have a conference and you can say that you have a chef thing.
Oh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair they have in Jersey!
Okay, you know that even if you're not. Here we go.
Wait! What about Joey?

Oh, um, there's even a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
It seems that two people really appreciate the Dewey decimal system.
I'm so sorry!
Sorry!
You have not brought

Hey!
Hello!
Oh, you know, Kash, I loved it the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
Okay, I just have to stop first from my house.
To register the game? You do it every time Ross, you are
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment has become available.
Oh, are you changing apartment?
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Yes, but when the baby arrives, he will want to move.
She is?
Yes, you did not expect him to live there with a baby, right?
I do not think I really thought about it.
Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
Damn!

See what I got! See what I got! See what I got! Can you believe that they do it for small people?
Small people from the village
Ok, look at this. This is my favorite
Oh, it's so sweet!
I know! Phoebe will like to dress them in these!
Huh. Except that Phoebe will not be the one who will dress them.
Because he will not be able to keep the children.
My God! We are launching the most depressing baby shower ever!
Wait a minute!
Unless we give her all the presents she can use after she's finished pregnant.
Umm similar, normal coffee, tequila.
Oh, and someone can take those leather pants he's always wanted!
Oh, he will worship it!

Okay, you two are asking the Court for a cancellation?
Yes, your honor, and here they are, are forms, all compiled.
So, based on your petition, you're looking for a cancellation based on the fact that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Well, I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is an intravenous addict.
What?!
Oh yes, heroin and crack.
The crack is not even an intravenous drug!
Well, you would know.
Now he also says that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh come on!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
No!
Phoebe just because I'm alone does not mean I want to go naked.
I mean, you live alone, do not go around naked.
Uh Huh! Why do you think it takes so long to answer the door?

I know, I lied! I did not want him to think I was a terrible mother! I can not even see my baby!
Oh sure, come here! Of course you can! Uh, look, look here, it's-is-is, it's right there.
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. Now I see it.
Really?
No, I do not see it!
Come on! Come on! Here, okay, do you understand that? This little thing looks like a peanut?
Yes.
Honey, that's it.
That's all? Well, I saw it! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
You are welcome.
Wow! I can not believe it's our baby.
Yes, this is our baby.

Gin.
We were playing Gin? You know, if we were a couple, we could play this naked game.
You will stop!
All right. All right.
Ok, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you.
But you'll always be the guy who pee on me.

Hey!
Hey!
Let me tell you about this girl I scored last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Hey, look at me, I'm a whore!
So, do you want to do something tonight?
Oh, I can not Dr. Roger is coming back.
Oh.
Oh right!
Right!
Because you're still seeing him, and he's a good boy.
I mean, I remember a time when
Are you OK?
Yes! Totally! Totally, and you?
Great! It is so incredible! I mean, the last time Dr. Roger arrived, I was
I bet he can.
You know, I do not have an appointment, but I certainly could use a physicist. Are you sure you're comfortable?
Oh yeah! Yes! Do not worry about me, I'll be fine!

You cleaned your clothes. This is the important part.
Oh, I guess. Except now everything seems a little bit
Whoa, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We had this cart.
Yes, but what if it is not? What happens if there is a reason why we can not have a baby?
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are planning to have children. I'm sure everything will be fine.
oh, oh, yes, okay, thank you.
I can not believe I did not even think about that.
I guess I'm so worried about having to ... come here and do ... 'that' ...
What, you can do it in a Taco Bell car park, but can not you do it in a doctor's office?
It was a "Wendy's !!"

... and then Zana, leave only a tear !!
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people I went to school with, because I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?
Like you, I do not even know where you work?
Yes.
Yes. Well, I think our second meeting will be a

Hey.
Hey!
So you stole my joke and stole my money.
Well, I was about to paste it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I'm a published writer.
Well, she will know that you stole the joke.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me over there?
Yes!
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway.
All right .
Here it is.
Ah, Gunther, I can not pay for it now because I'm not working, so I had to reduce some luxuries like, uh, to pay for things.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I do not know.
See, it's just, you see I was a regular on a soap opera, you know?
And to move from this to this, I only have Plus, I should wait on all my friends.
Ok, but the money is good, plus you can fix Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?

I have no name
Okay, so, what should we call you?
Okay, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
In no way are you cool enough to pull off Clint.
Okay, so which name is nice enough to pull out?
Umm, Gene.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
See you later, Gene.
Hi, Gene.
It's Clint!
What happens to Gene?

Welcome to Las Vegas.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Yes i did it. Thank you so much, it was excellent.
I hope you had a nice flight.
Oh, it was the best!

Oh, Larry.
Umm, do the health inspectors work on commission?
No, bribes.
It's okay to laugh, right?
Come on, Joey !!!
Rachel, I told you everything I knew last night!
Look, it's not a big deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I can not believe you would say it!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
No! I mean, let's go! This is a
I do not know.
Is she romantic with her?
I do not know.
They are in love?
I do not know.
You do not know anything.
Oh, I know one thing!
What?
They did it right there on the couch.

Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour and a lot of people who are less sick than my friend's.
I mean, that guy with his toe?
Who is sleeping with?
Oh, come on, Dora, do not be angry ...
I know we both said some things we did not mean, but that does not mean we do not love each other yet.
You know, I feel like I've lost it .. Ba-!

So you see, Molly, what people do not understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
So where did you study?
Oh, I did not go to college.
No, where did you study acting?
Molly ... people do not study acting ...
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us a minute?
Of course, I'm going to check on Emma.
Thank you.
The stable boy will never get the princess ??
What do you plan to do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
No ... the skin sticks to my ass.
You know, this is not right.
What makes you think that I'm going to sleep with her and then blow her away?
Eh?
Guys, can not you open your mind to the possibility that I really like her, and could I want something real?
Look, the truth is, I have not felt this way about anyone since Rachel, okay?
I did not think I could ever love again.
Come on! Joe!
Ok
Hi, is Molly here?
Yes, come inside. Molly?
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha. See you tomorrow.
Ok ... Well, Joey, I guess we have no problems.
It's as if my favorite fairy tale came true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!

And the beauty is that the character is from Naples, right?
Yes.
All my family comes from Naples!
Oh that's great! Ok, I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to, Leslie
Joey, this is the embarrassing part.
Oh!
Hey, right!
It's not a problem.
I understand well.
You must make sure you do not have horrible scars or tattoos.
Do not worry; I have nothing to hide.
So here you are, it's me.
One hundred percent natural!
I tell you, it never happened before.

This room is available.
All right!
OK wait!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Since I waited four women, this is four, one taller than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, I went and I went with their children!
I'm next!
It's my turn!
It's just right!
And if you bring a woman inside and she has her baby before me, I'll sue you!
Not this hospital, I denounce you!
And my husband is a lawyer!
Uh Rach
Back on that treasure case!
I do not think the next patient is very far.
Ok, well then bring it in
OMG!!!

Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy and that guy. And that guy! They are all huge!
They do not look bigger than me!
Well, maybe it's because you're closer to you. So you seem bigger from where you are.
I'm just about to say hello to the boys. All right?
All right.
All right.
Hello.
Whoa! I liked it
Ok, I know what I have to do. I have to go to Ross Ross. You know, Red Ross!
I absolutely do not know what you're talking about.
Come on! The moment when we were all waiting in line
You know, you guys were much more available when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Phoebe, listen, if you decide to do it, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Yes.
We just want you to think about it.
Yes, honey, maybe you can talk to someone who has had a baby. Like your mother?
My mother never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.

Umm, thanks for meeting me.
Thank you. All right.
Come and sit down.
Sit.
Sit!
Umm, omnipotent, before I start, I just need you to declare for the official record that you're actually Frank Buffay.

You're lucky ....
Everyone, this is Paul. Paul, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Hello!
And Joey ....
Hello!
And Ross.
Hello!
He does not speak much English.
Look that!
So, um ... where does Paul come from?
Oh ... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. In our lives
Well, the cat ... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
This is fun ... .... and Rachel keeps touching it.
Alright. I looked all over the building and did not find the cat anywhere.
Oh, I found it. It was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! Here it is! Last to know it again! And I'm guessing ... since nobody told me ... this is Paul.
Ah, Paul, this is Phoebe.
I bet!

Ok, where the hell did you get it ?!
When mom and dad took you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam in the lake and fished out.
That cup is mine!
No it is not! You want it, you have to win it!
All right, so we're not having dinner at all?
Why?
Because I do not work at the Szechwan Dragon.
All right.
You really need to sleep a little, honey.
I know I do it.
Hello.
Hello.
Guess what?
What?
They published my article.
Oh, really, show me, show me.
Rach, look! Oh hello! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker who comes to save me. There he is.

My God.
You know what it is, this is that we are getting ready for the dance.
Oh.
What?! You got us evicted !!
I told you not to go over there!
Well, he made Rachel cry!
Rachel always cries!
It's not true!
Now Joey, go over there and suck it alone. I mean you suck like you've never done before!
All right! I'll try! But if I can not, you can stay with Chandler and I until you settle down.
Leave!!
All right, all right, all right.
I mean, I'll have to check it first, but I'll think it will agree.

So, he's just a good guy. Do you really think that this Mark wants nothing in return for helping him?
Well, I suppose I'll have to take a shower with him, but you know, it's true for any job.
How do you feel?
Well, my apartment is gone, because I drank it.
Where did you get too? We lost you after opening all the presents.
Yes.
Yes, I ended up in the warehouse and not alone.
Woooo hoooo !!!
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Why, what happened?
Ah, I was fooled with Joey's sister. Well, this is not the worst part.
What's the worst part?
I can not remember which sister.
See what men do! Do not tell me men are not cute! This is a man !!

What's wrong with you?
Anything!
Well, I had this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights first, then I fainted and since then I have not been able to stand up.
But um, I do not think it's serious.
It looks like a hernia. Devi-tu-tu-Go to the doctor!
There's no way!
'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it will be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Why do I have to start working again?
Damn you 15s!
And a little '
It has all these levels.
First there is a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then a custard, which I made from scratch.
[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, other ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something wrong]
then a little more custard, and then the bananas, and then I just added some whipped cream!
It tastes like feet!
I like it.
Are you kidding?

Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks you're a fox.
Welcome everyone, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
Guys, we can please do not look all right.
Shhhh!
People, it's never happened to you.
Go to the fridge to get a nice glass of milk, and these damn boxes are so floating that you can not open them.
Oh, you said Mike. Aw! There must be a better way!
And there's Kevin.
Can we please disable it?
Noo, Kevin.
There's a revolutionary new product that guarantees you'll never have to open the milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Are you curious?
You're flingin'-flangin 'true I'm!
Keep in mind that you've never used this product before, you'll see how easy it is to do it.
Go ahead.
It works with any milk carton.
Wow, it's easy. Now I can have milk every day.

Well, you could tell him that his wife seems to be gay.
She's not she's gay. My God. She is
Good day for married people eh?
I'm sorry your husband betrayed you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women are not great too.
Try telling my wife.

Hey, Ross, will you hand me that knife?
I can not wait to be with you!
I'll be secretly as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
I'll just tell Rachel that I'll do the laundry for a couple of hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is this my new nickname?
Awww, you know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
Arghh !!

I can not believe I'm losing this job!
Oh I'm so sorry! Is there anything I can do?
Yes! Help me get this mini-fridge over the security guard.
Hey, Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yes?
Well, I do not want to talk to you Wayne!
I hate you!
You ruined my life!
Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
Wayne, Chandler.
Hello how are you?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I will take you back to your job if you help me.
Why should I help you?
The reason he just said.
What do you need?
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, do you know Sarah?
What?
And I'm just a love machine too.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.

Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. It's just the sweetest little man!
See you, Phoebe! Oh, hey, thank you for sneaking in!
Did you splinter inside ?!
Yes, uh-huh, 100 dollars.
Phoebe! I can not believe you gave them money! I thought I agreed that it was absolutely unreasonable to ask me for that money!
Yes, but they did not ask me!
You know?
In this way it is only you, the exotic and generous foreigner.
It's always fun to be.
Yes, but you're making me look bad!
No I'm not.
No!
If ever I'm making you look better!
They will see you talking to me and this is ... I am a success!
Oh hey, Phoebe!
Hey!
Oh hey, Ross.
Umm, you see, I was thinking that maybe you two could change apartments because Phoebe is more our kind of people.
Something to think about.
Yes, okay, my bad.

All right, all right, all right ...
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?
Whaddya thinks? Today is the big day!
My God. Ok, go to the bathroom, use whatever you want, but never tell me what you did there.
Thank you!
Where's Joey? His mother is on the phone.
He is in the bathroom. I do not think you want to go in there!
Come on, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...
Who is noisy?
Oh, that would be Monica.
Hey, listen, I want to borrow a couple of things, Aurora has spent the night, I really want to have breakfast.
Oh, you've got all night, eh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes to Ethan, so, you know ...
Ooh, do I feel a little resentful?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.
'Kay?
You know, in a relationship, do you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
Well, every single second is like that with Aurora ... and I just lost about thirty-five of them talking to you, so ... Monica, can you help me with the door?
Sure.
Oh, um, Chandler?
You know, the ... old Monica would ... would remind you to rub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush ... But I will not.

Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Hey, Joey! Aww, you remembered even if you're a big star!
Aw, let's go! It will take years before you forget!
Joey, how's it on a movie set, eh?
Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, well yes, yes, I have all this going on.
Yes, listen, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he could not have been more wrong!
Uh Oh!
I have to go Monica, eh, my sushi is here!
I'm sorry for that Thanks for waiting.
Everyone is smiling! OK thank you very much! Enjoy your stay in

Wow, it's great, guys. The whole city is dark!
Mum says it's all over Manhattan, part of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it will come back.
Wow, guys, this is great.
Pants and a sweater?
Why, mom?
Who will I meet in a blackout?
Guys from the electric company?
Suitable Looters?
Could we talk about it later?
OK.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check my grandma. What is my number?
Well, I'll never call

What are you doing?
Take a swim
What about the girl?
The chicks do not swim.
Are you sure?
I do not know. Should we try it?
Sure.
See, I told you they do not swim.
Wait. Give it a minute.
Noo! Oh, everything's fine, everything's fine, baby, baby, baby.

I'm taking care of you, eh?
You guys feel safe.
Right?
Ok, I'll take that bubble spit like, "Yes, I do!"
Ok, after getting rid of this dirty Leslie diaper, I'll fix you with a clean one.
Ok I'm sorry.
I did not mean to scare you.
I just have to clean it up.
All right?
Because let's face it, we're from Monica.
I broke it.
All right.
Well, this is just the way it goes.
Good ok.
Why are there only two of you?
Where is Leslie?
Well, you can not answer.
Leslie?
Where are you Leslie?
Leslie, now it would be a

Hey!
Hey.
Hey, why are you washing your ceiling?
Oh, there's banana on it.
You said it was bald.
Yes, it was bald, it is not now.
How could you not tell me that he has hair?
I do not know, I almost never say it about people.
Ohh, well, this is simply perfect!
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you said it was fine.
Yes, I said what was good when I thought it was a strange bald girl. I mean, you know, that girl has hair
Well, maybe it will not work. Maybe Ross will not like his personality.
Why, does he have a bad personality?
Oh no, Bonnie is the best!

Hey!
Hey.
Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I am, I'm really uncomfortable talking.
Sure. What? About you, are you taking a shower with your mother?
Actually I had an argument in mind! I am, I am going through a period of drought, wise sex.
Whoa, for how many months?
Excellent! Excellent! And finally, you're in some strange stuff, you know, sexually?
No!
Oooh, wrong answer.

Ouch! My ass is fine. All right. Oh, shhh!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I did not want to make any noise!
So do not break up !!
Oh yes, Smokey Joe here came halfway to the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old child.
So why are you smoking?
Well, it's very upsetting.

Honey, I was wondering ....
Hmm?
Do you still have that one, um, Navy uniform?
Nooo, I had to return it instead of the costume.
Hmm.
I think I have an old high school band uniform.
Remember you did not have sex in high school, right?
Yes.
Well honey, and you?
What?
I mean, you're having fun, you know, things like fantasy?
No.
Come on, you must have one!
Ugh!
I do not know Monica.
It's fun to be here.
I mean, if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, it's like cheating on Chandler.
Not at these prices.
Hello. You know, in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Court!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You must hear this bad boy.
Eh, Monica, it seems so strange, you know, Chandler is your friend ... Oh!
My God!
Oh, all right, take this bed, you can make other friends.

You know, ever since I was a child, I've been able to gain fourths with my toes.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my photos. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
All right.
Oh, are you sure?
Really?
Because you know, you could make small puppets and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
We can not do it.
What? What can not you do?
Did he really say that?
Well, I added the "exactly like me" part ...
But she said she's looking for someone, and someone will be there tonight.
'Tonight tonight?
Well, I think it's perfect
You know, it's just the two of us, he spent the whole day taking care of my monkey ...
I can not remember the last time I had a girl taking care of my monkey.
In any case, I thought that after work I would go and get a bottle of wine, go over there and try to court her.
Hey, you know what you should do? You should bring it back in 1890, when that phrase was used for the last time.

The car is waiting downstairs, I just wanted to leave these copies of my book for your friends. Something you want from Lisbon?
No, just knowing that you'll be there will be enough.
Well, well, be good, I love you.
You kissed my best Ross! ... Or something like that.
All right. Look, it was stupid.
Truly stupid.
Truly stupid.
And I do not even know how it happened.
I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
Are we okay now?
Yes. No. No ...
Ah, forbidden love of a man and his door.
Shh. He did it. He told her no, not just about the kiss, about everything.
Are you kidding.
No, no. He said, "When will you grow up and start being a mom?"

Oh here it is.
They're not your normal dry cleaners.
I know, but that creep I went to on that date goes there, so I have to find a new one.
I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
What?!
A new grocery store.
The universe said I would meet a good guy and that's what they gave me?
When I'm up there, I'll kick my ass.
Do not worry, Phoebe, you'll meet someone. If I can meet a good boy, you can do it too.
Yes, we can both. And we will do both.
Oh, you did not have to come with me.
Are you kidding? This is where spots come out! All right? This is how
All right.
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped Wow!
What?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
Oh yes, I'm sorry for that too, but what are you going to do?
I hope you do not think I'm crazy, but I feel like I want to pick it up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
A bit. Now you're talking.
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
I-I-I would like it. Just let me tell my friend.
Ooh, an inkblot! Hey, can I see how you get it?
She must have left.

Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We are in the same team!
Four hours? Did you guys do it for four hours?
It's right, honey.
All right, let me in
Ninth! Do not do it! Do not do it!
What?
It's a dropper!
Oh yes, it's true!
I'm not a dropper!
It's really a three-person game, you know?
He is launching and taking!
All right.
Oh! Oh! It's so difficult.
Whoa-whoa guys, it's not a cat!
Oh my God, oh my God!
I give up guys, I do not know what I will do with this thing!
Cooking it did not help, eh?
All right, well, the place was closed. I will copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why do not you move to me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no It's okay, I mean I-look at Rach, I know I've scared you with the whole naked Thursday thing, but we do not have to do it!
Well, it would be easier to move right across the corridor. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
Thursday is clearly not good for you, choose one day!

So they are two boxes of Macaron Holiday. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Admit it, Chandler, you do not have the reverse.
Excuse me small, I have a very solid backhand.
Shield your face and scream like a girl ... it's not a backhand.
I was screaming ... like a marine.
All right here. Look at me while I play the three Ps of the championship game. Power. Precision. and penache.

It is not very a phone person.
So, uh, so, what's the problem with this father, I mean, if someone had been my son somewhere, I wanted to know, you know?
Hey, Knick fan, are you interested in your opinions about fatherhood? Uh, no.
Okay, look, maybe I should go.
Maybe you should.
Good luck, and uh, be careful, eh?
Do you know what the Celtics problem is? Let the players manage the team.
Oh, it's not true.
Oh, it is.
It is not.
IS.
It is not!

Okay sir, this ends today's lesson, and let's remember, we're safe out there.
It's a great class.
Thank you.
Yes, yes, I was watching.
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
Umm, about that last move where the woman tripped you and then nailed you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Well, she took her keys and tries to block them
No. No-no. No. What it would be
Who? Me the attacker?
I'm sorry Chandler, you know you're so sweet and I do not want to hurt you.
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
No-no-Really ?!
Obviously!
Well, it hurts so much. I
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Well, maybe there's something you can do.
What?! Nothing! Nothing!
Well, I umm, I mean it's just at the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but would it be possible for him to audition for your movie to say Thursday?
Absolutely! But you, would you really feel better with me than I refuse if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. See you later.

OK! I got it. I will flee over there. I will come back here. OK let's go
Hey guys. Listen, I'm sorry to have played the game before - Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
They are all Chandler.
Chandler sucks! He could not get this good!
I did it. But it came at a price.
But Ben arrives tonight and he can not see him.
Oh come on, at the age of seven children have already seen orgies. Was it just me?

Sure!
Ok, I was thinking we should have a nice guest room, right?
With a mahogany boat bed and bedside tables with flowers all the time!
And we could have a desk with comment papers on them so people could say how much they loved staying here !!
Ok, anyway, I did not think about it a lot.
Well, I like the idea.
Obviously!
I was thinking that maybe-maybe-it could be a game room, you know?
I mean, you can buy old arcade games like ...
No.
Ok, so you do not mean as in "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea, let's discuss it before you completely reject it".
Oh sorry. Of course I say it. An interesting idea, umm, we'll talk about it, but no.
So, is it so?
I do not think the arcade games go to the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room will be full of antiques.
And that is why
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I have nothing against the beautiful guest room, especially since everyone we know lives about 30 seconds away!
You are making a fool of me?
No, I'm not kidding you, or you're a nice guest room.

You know, I love doing crosswords with you, honey!
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
All right! There is only one word left, three letters, not dog but
Cat.
Yup! You're so smart! I love you.
I love you too.

I never sucked, I did not really want you to know how good I was!
Why?
I do not know.
Is fantastic! Now we can enter the doubles tournaments!
That is

Hey!
Hey. Ok, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
But
No! Ninth! It is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended it to me. He said: "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
All right. Ok, but you can not fire him today.
Why not?!
Because I'm downloading it today.
What?! You said it was sweet!
he
Just do not take your phone.
Then it arrives! "I'm so worried about you." UCK! Be a man!
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
You can not fire it and download it the same day, it will kill you.
Okay then, I'll dismiss him today and you go out with him for another week.
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I will kill
Ok, so we'll do both today and he'll just have to deal with it!
All right. But the question is who will go first. Because who goes second is the bitch.
Really? This is the thing I'm worse off! You will see.

This is the last boarding for the 664 flight to Yemen.
Well, I think I have to go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I will wait for you. Do you know at least how long you've left?
Well, only until we find a source of energy to replace the fuel.
Oh. Well, I'll fix you every day. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Ok, goodbye. Goodbye.
Chandler?
No!
Chandler!
Janice!
Here you are!
Here you are!
I had to take a last kiss and you said that you would leave immediately after getting on the plane!
No! No! I want to see you take off.
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we arrive in Yemen, can I stay with you?

Hello!
Hey.
Hey, how's Hilda? Is working?
Ohh, my new assistant is working, yes.
Was he happy that I had given her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy to have hired my new assistant.
Hello?
Oh hey!
Can you, can you wait a second?
They are the producers of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
can you excuse me for a minute?
Hey, funny you should call.
I was just looking at the script for next week.
Canceled?!
As if they were removing it from the air?
Ohh.
All right, I'll see you on Monday.
We do not even shoot them anymore? !!
All right bye!
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Joey.
Why should they do it? It was a good show, right?

It is so isolated here.
I know. I like it here.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Ops. Sorry.
What's up, honey? Have you seen a mouse?
Ninth! Big bear! Big Bear out! I think I-I-you ... actually, do you want to check?
Honey, we have no bears here.
Then OK. Would you like ... take me?
All right. I will be right back.
All right. What?! What are you doing here?!
What are
I came with Paul!
Yes, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!
Here go honey!
Ahh. Thank you!
Diet Coke
What the hell was that ?!
A lesson on the importance of unagi.
Ohh,
Maybe. Now I'm curious, at what point, during those screaming girls, would you have started?
All right, so we were not
I'm sorry I took such drastic measures to express my opinion, but I ... look, I just want you guys to be safe.

What are you doing?
I'm leaning. This is the point where I support myself.
All right. (Go up and swell the pillows on the sofa.
Brenda bee!
What?
Yup! It flew into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons for fear that they sting you!
I think I know what's going on here.
You do?
Look, I know it must be hard for your wife to be a lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
I understand well. I can

All right, let's do it!
No, no, no. What was that?
I know, it was the best I could get from them.
Well, people!
People, people, people.
Let's try again, and this time let's all look at Joey.
Show how it works.
Contact them.

So what did you decide? Your uncle Nathan receives an invitation or not?
Oh, God, nobody likes it, and it's so cheap, it would never fly to London in a million years.
Yes, I invite you?
Hey, did I do it well enough?
Yes, they're fine.
Yes?
If someone asks you, we'll just say that Ben has sent them. Oh! So you invited Rachel back then?
Sure. Why not?
Really?
Yes?
I do not think I would feel comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Wait-wait-wait, believe, maybe we should not invite her?
Oh, no-no, you know I absolutely love Rachel, it's just that, well, it could be an embarrassment for you.
But it is absolutely your decision.
More tea?
Yes sure.
Gray count?
Eh? Yes, well, invite anyone you want.

Hello.
Hey!
Hey! So, how was the doctor?
Oh, everything went great
Good.
Oh hey, show them the image of your womb.
Oh.
I do not see the child. Where is it?
Oh no, I know I did not see it at first, but it's right, Ross, I lost it again.
Oh. (Takes the photo and hugs her.

I'm sorry?
Can you help me with something?
The patient I am looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
Er, it's like the early 30s, very attractive.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Oh yay! Great! Ok, in what room number is it?
I'm sorry, this information is limited to hospital staff
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Dr. Drake who?
Remoray. He is Portuguese. We need that information; I am a doctor.
A doctor in this hospital?
Damn it, we're wasting precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
Hands.
Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me in which room my assistant was staying.
He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
It is in room 816.
816, thank you!
Thank you.
And what's his name?
No!

Hello!
Hello!
Rachel was just helping me. My head was burned by the sun.
Awww.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Ok, see you in our room.
Yes.
My God.
I know.
Ok, i have to go.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Well, I have to go break up with Bonnie.
Here?! Now?!
Good yes.
I can not ... I can not stay here all night, and if I go, she ... would like to ... do things.
What happened?
He will not make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Oh, friend! Chicago, it's so lucky!
Stupid, useless Canadian money!

Rachel, one of your clients seems to have left his wallet. A Joshua Bergen.
Really?
Will you call him?
Yup!
I will do it!
Absolutely!
(He takes his driver's license and license and keeps them standing face-to-face.
Then proceed to act as Dark Helmut in

My God! It's so beautiful!
I'm full, and yet I know if I'll stop eating it, I'll regret it.
Hey!
Hey!
What do you have there?
Oh, umm, it's a tofu cake. Do you want some?
What are you doing tonight?
Eh? uh
Guy! Guy!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I have these plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had an appointment at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
This is what Monica said.
After he gave me that important speech ?!
Do you go and make an appointment with a guy the same night he's scheduled with me?
I think he's trying to make it fast on Big Daddy!

OK, is this lamp in the same place?
Who cares? I reject women.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no !!! You can not come here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
What?!
It's yours!
Yeah, well, I'm a whore.
Me too.
Hi Jill!
Hey!
Hello .
Rachele.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not home, you're six-you're right here.
Yes, I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it is not!
All right. So well, umm, I'll have her come home by midnight.

That part was perfect for me! I can not believe I did not understand it!
I'm sorry, buddy.
Hey, you know what you should do?
You should make something happen for you.
You know, how to write a drama.
Write a movie!
Eh?
I mean, what about those
Come on Ross, be realistic, you know? If I had written something, what are the chances I could have for those guys?
Wait a second, I could stay in it!
Or that.
I can not write!
You know, I mean, I_I_I'm an actor, I do not have the discipline that you take, you know?
I can not do that
I will help you.
Yes, I will prepare a program and make sure you commit yourself.
Plus, it will give me something to do.

Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do you do?
Oh, above all fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope it's beautiful.
Yes, it's beautiful. Because I have models here, you know ...... never.
Oh yes, during the summer, I spend most of the weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use.
Although, I should probably tell you, it's a porn star.
Well, listen, I still have one more person to meet, but unless you reveal your sister, I think you have a good chance.
All right.

As bad as it was, I really enjoyed it. I think I will apologize for all the stupid things I do.
Why do not you stop doing stupid things? So you should not apologize.
I would really like it if I could do both.
All right, I have to ask.
What?
Will you break me if you get fat again?
What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could he earn?
One hundred forty-five pounds.
Yes yes it is. It's uh every time on the lips! Why?! Why on the lips?
Here is Frannie. Hmm, will not you be happy to see me?
Now wait a minute, be nice! All right? I did not bring you here so you can take an ambush.
Frannie was the one who found yours
That bitch!
Monica! What
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like it?!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Invite my brother, invite all my family, and not me?
Why?!
What, why would not you want me at your wedding?
What could I possibly do?
Stuart!
I believe you know my husband.
So it's really a question of

Hey sir! What are you here for?
Hey, Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yes?
It's a crime that you and I do not spend more time together.
What happens?
Well, I heard you were thinking of asking Phoebe to move you and I thought maybe we should talk.
Friend, me.
Sure. All right.
Uh, are you crazy? You are crazy? If you live with Phoebe, you two will know, live-live together!
Yes, I ... I considered it. I only know that it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.
Hey! Oh listen, I was just freeing up space for your stuff.
Oh thank you, but listen, I was from Monica and she and Chandler had a fight and they are not moving.
What do you mean, are not they moving? Are they still moving in the right?
No-no, they just had a big bang on what to do with my room.
What?! Beyond a stupid room!
Yes, I feel a bit 'bad for them, but I'm also very sensual because I do not have to move here!
Oh no, yes no, that part is great!

Yup
Shut-out !!
Where are you guys going? Come on, still a game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yes, leave!
You guys are always around in my apartment!
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, eh?
Come on, wussies!
All right, ok, I have to go.
I go, and I leave.
Another match?
Oh yeah!

I'm sorry.
Ohhh. Do not go
No, I_I_I have to go.
No. No! No! No!
Honey, honey, people are watching.
I do not care! I do not care !!
Yes, um, I am, I'm leaving now.
You can not leave! I have your shoe!
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those in plain clothes.

Oh, ew!
What?
Yes, I know what I wanted to ask you.
Um, can you roll your tongue?
Because I can, and my mother could not, and I thought you knew, I thought it was something I received from our father.
What, wait, you mean like this?
Yes, yes. You can do it a.
You're not doing it.
Oh, ok, yes, my mother could, and I can not. We do not have this ....
Where there is no fear of engaging.
We have ... Do we have any ideas here?
Well, I never went through the tunnel alone, because, as I understand it, you're not allowed to bring more than one girl into the car, right.
But, it seems to me that it's practically like anything else, you know, face your fear.
He's afraid of heights, go to the top of the building!
If you're scared of bugs ... take a bug.
Right.
In this case, you're afraid of committing yourself, so I'll tell you that you go there and be the busiest guy who ever existed.
Surprisingly, this makes sense.
You think?
Oh yeah. Go get it, skip the high dive, fix the gun barrel, pee in the wind!
Yes, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring at the barrel of a gun, I'm practically peeing anyway.

Hey! Hey!
Hello!
Hello! Look! I got our photos developed by the Rockefeller Center.
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to see pictures of me and Mona's ice skating?
Oh, I usually love it too, but I'm just submerged now.
Hey, where are the pictures that the creepy pretzel salesman got us together?
Oh yes, probably at the end. My God! He just took pictures of my breasts!
I miss the photo?!
You know he has a face Ross!
All right. Ok, here's one of us.
Wow!
This is good!
Wow, it looks like a business card, you know, with the tree in the middle, the skaters and the snow.
You know, every year I say I'll send greeting cards and I never do.
Do you want to send it together?
Together? Similar to people?
Yes, you know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It will be nice, ok?
All right.
Oh, I have to go to work. So call me later?
Uh sure, of course.
Hi guys.

I mean, I do not even feel like having a girlfriend anymore.
Do you want me to leave my job to feel like you have a girlfriend?
Is it about Mark?
My God.
Ok, it's not, it's not.
My God. I can not keep having the same fight with you, Ross! Listen, maybe we should take a break.
Well, you're right.
Let's take a break, let's take a break, okay, let's get some frozen yogurt, or something like that ..
No. A break from us.

Bing! We are ready for tonight, at 8 o'clock.
Oh uh, apparently, we can not do it. Monica must work.
Oh, my ex-wife did not work unless you call yourself into her mother's work. Beautiful. Tomorrow evening, then.
Oh, well, tomorrow's not good for her either.
Oh? Why not?
They are the semi-finals of his ball tournament rejected.
What's happening to Bing? Um, does your wife have a problem with me or something?
Well, now you're just talking crazy.
So why can not we all go out together?
Because we-we have left each other. Monica and I broke up. Hold me.
Good Lord Bing, I can not say I'm completely surprised, I saw the way he looked at you and there was no love there.
And the way he looked at me, pure lust.
You know, what would really help me in this difficult moment is suffocating something. Can I suffocate you?
Bing, my boy, we will get you through this.
Now here's the plan, get your coat, let's go to a strip club.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would drive you crazy. But to hell with that bitch.

Look at you, sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel ... with Emma's little chubby hands wrapped around you.
It's all right, Emma, ​​you're sleeping.
: Move away from the cradle, I have a weapon!
It's all right, everything's fine, Rach, it's me. Put the piercing down.
What are you doing?
Well, I heard Emma waving, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Oh, thank you. Well, now that I'm awake, I'm going to the bathroom.
Here's sweet ... It's not over.

Called?
No sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he would call. Why did not he call?
Perhaps it is intimated by women who are really intelligent, strong and successful.
Sophie, please get out of my ass. Why did not he call, Rachel? Why?
Ok ok. Umm, well, maybe he, maybe he feels embarrassed because you're my boss.
Awkward? Why should you feel uncomfortable?
Well...
The only person who should feel uncomfortable is you, and you did not tell him not to call me, right?
No me ...
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend who attends someone you work for, there are always ways to solve ... that.

And are you angry because you did not make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I ask is just a little emotion!
Is it too much to ask after six years ?!
I mean what?
I'm-am-am Rachel and I'm not as close as you guys are!
I mean, do not we have a lot of fun ?!
Do not I deserve some tears? !!
I mean, we-we told Joey, he cried out loud!
Hey!
I did not cry!
Come on!
It's like the end of an era!
No more J-man and Channie's!
!
Ok, I have to ask, who's calling us ?!

Do I know why we are running?
Yes, do you know the ah, the girl I told you about last night?
Well, it turns out that ah, he wants to get back together with me.
Oh, I found it!
!
It's great for you guys!
Yes!
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Oh thanks. Hey, hey. Rachel !!!!
Hello. Ohhh, you received my message.
Yes, oh hey, you're right in time.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, you can, a lot.
Ahhhh !!

Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that I may have lost the table!
Do
ah,
Do
ah,
DO?
You know, I do not understand why they did not cry. It was a nice speech.
Oh come on.
Hey!
Everything you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we learned a lot from mom and dad!
And that picture of Chi-Chi with his mischievous grin.
And what you said about Nana.
Ohh, yes, she really wanted to be there.
And you know what?
I think it was.
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?

You forgot how many great songs Heart had.
Yes.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So, you heard, you repeated it, so this must mean you wrote it.
Oh, guys, with this joke. I have to say that I know I broke, but I'm not even sure I understood it.
What, did not you understand? The doctor is a monkey.
And the monkeys can not write the prescriptions.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think "the Hef" would not agree, which is why he sent me a check for a hundred dollars a-ha.

I can not find the trash bags!
Oh, I think I saw a little here.
What is that?!
I do not know! But maybe if we keep that drawer closed, it will die.
I can not believe we are living here!

Have you still told Rachel that you were not really proposing?
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she pulled her breasts out.
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And how was it ?!
I did not watch it. The head of a stupid child was blocking most of it.
Go and tell Rachel now, before Ross finds out.
Look, it's not that easy. He said he wanted to marry me. I do not want to hurt her.
Ok, look, do it gently.
You are right.
You are right.
I - I'm going to tell him now, before Ross finds out and I'll be nice.
I can do it.
I'm a kind person.
Oh, by the way.
Two people who get in there if you want to check it out.

Hi, Phoebe?
Ok, so I just talked to the nurse and why your doctor is late and why, he will not come.
What?!
Okay, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on these really creepy mores in England.
Which
How would you describe the theme of this book, see here, Rachel Green?
Umm, well, I should say it's one, it's a tragic love story.
Well, it's a fact, but yes. Anybody else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, uh, the wildness of the costumes, which
Excellent! What Rachel astutely observed here
You completely stole my answer!
Well, honey, it was pretty obvious.
Well, how would you know ?! You have not even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
I think yours is a question with many answers.
Would you like to venture?
wanted
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Are you just repeating what?
All right, let's move on.
Alright then.

All right, all right, this is great, Chandler, you put yourself behind the desk.
And ... and when she arrives hopefully, she will not recognize you because, well, why should she?
Uh, okay, and then you make the buzz Ross and me
You are Mr. Gonzalez, and I will be, Mr. Wong.
Different.
Someone asked for security?
You are beautiful.
Okay, which one of you is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Where's my ring? My grandmother's faith dead? Where is it? Where is it?
Way to be cool, friend.
What are you talking about?
There was a ring, in a box, on my bedside table, after you left, it was gone!
Wait, do you think he stole a ring?
We know you got it like that, just to save time and confess!
Ok, who are you?
The Hardy guys?
Look, I do not need to steal a stupid ring, okay?
I earn $ 1,600 a week doing what I do; does any of you guys do it?
Marry me.

My God! Joey!
Hell yeah! I will marry you!
You can not marry him!
Hey, madam, your day is over! It's my turn!
Phoebe!
Why?! Why can not you marry me ?!
I can and I will!
She is not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel is that pregnant.
My God.
Hey!
Phoebe, I think he would notice if you did not have a baby in nine months!
It's Joey!
Now I can not believe it! What? Is Rachel pregnant? Who is the father?
We do not know
Ohh I wonder if that guy.
Is there a guy?
Yes.
Who? Who is it?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I did not see who he was but
The story was over?
The boy left this.
My God! I know who the father is
People have to finish their stories!

Oh my God, you're back!
Ohh, show me! Show me your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I want to see what's in your hand. I want to see the trash.
Yes.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw it away.
No!
Me too!
Hey, when the music starts again, I was thinking of getting into the robot, you know?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we do not want to look stupid!
Well, we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Three two one!
Cut!
No! Year! Happy New Year!
Ok, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice job to everyone that's a conclusion!

So Lizzie, are there-are you going to stay the night?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Good. Good. It's not that we do not want you to stay, of course you're welcome. How many tasks do you still have?
I see. You know, Phoebe makes bunny socks.
No!
No, she is not.
Uh Phoebe, what he does ... those are the rabbits with the socks.
They are completely different - OK!
All right!
All right!
I did not do it!
I'm sorry!
I completely forgot about tonight and the fact that we should
Oh alright. I do not
No-no, it's not good!
It is not!
I mean, you were just so amazing!
You spent all this time and this effort to make this tape for me!
You know, I'll do it ... I'll see you!
I will do it!
I-I go
Well, I thought a lot about the tape.

No. And then I called him, and he was not there.
Well, then he is, probably alone, out.
Oh, thank you very much, I'm glad you came.
Hello.
Hello! It's me.
Hello! Oh, I'm so happy you called.
Really? I thought, this is crazy, I mean do not do it, do not you think we can work on this?
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Who is that?
Nobody.
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Is it Mark?
Umm, honey, look, it's just arrived ...
Yes! Done!
Hey, dinosaur boy, look at you, so sad. Come Dance.
Ah, all right, thanks.
Hey, you do not have to smile. You just have to dance.
Look, I do not feel like dancing, I want to drink something. All right?
Oh ok. Hey, two beers.

Do you want to go to the bedroom? It's a bit more comfortable.
Sure.
All right. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of ​​talking sexy?
Seriously, do you know the contracts I gave you, did you notice them at night?
Which contracts?
Okay, please tell me this is just one of your jokes that you do that I do not understand.
What kind of thing?
You know, like when you put your phone in your pants?
Label!
I'm serious!
This is not fun!
Those contracts absolutely had to come out today!
Rachel, I'm sorry, but you did not give me any contracts!
Yes i did it! And I put a little
I'm telling you, you never gave it to me.
You know what Tag, if we went to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I would see you embarrassed because I am
Or maybe you would see me embarrassed because you're talking on the phone with your horse!
Do you want to go to the office right now?
No! Come on late, we will not go to the office.
Ok I understand. I would not even be denied.
Ok, take your coat! Oh! When did you do this? Good job!

Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
Nice to meet you.
Oh and I need to talk to you.
About what?
To see if you know what these guys are talking about.

Phoebe, how are you?
I'm fine. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking fast?
No, it seems like me. Phoebe, it's going great. Look at Chandler with the little girl Chandler.
Little Chandler girl, where did I hear it before?
Oh right, coach Ruben.
Do you know what Phoebe is?
When you're over there, we have a situation here too.
Na-uh, no, we're all responsible for our children.
See that's where I think you're wrong. We have played these children, man by man; we really should play a zone defense.
What do you mean?
Forgive me? You did not keep my calls in a week!
Well, I'm completely over Chandler. Friends forever! Do not come here!
Uh, what was it?
uh,

... I am, I'm fine.
Sounds good. I'll call you - or call me, whatever ...
All right.
Hello.
Whoo-hoo!
Yes, here you are!
Second appointment!
...I do not know.
you
Well, it looks very pretty and all, but all that story of her coming up here, just to see if I was okay?
I mean ... how much is needy?

Do you remember when you where a child and your mom release you to the cinema with a jar of jam and a teaspoon?
You are so cute.
Hello!
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, oh, do you know that guy who followed me? I spoke with him today.
Did you talk to him. You are crazy?

Thank you, happy holidays.
Now that's trash. Miss, you can not Hey! Stop that young woman, donated the trash!
Hey !!
The charity is on fire!
Help!
Oh good!
Thanks, I need it.
Whoa!
What is that?!
It's nine o'clock in the morning!

Can I help you?
Uh yes, where ... where is the guy who decides what are the pictures on the wall?
He is not here now.
Oh, you're kidding me!
All right, make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani has stopped leaving all these clothes.
All right?
I am an actor; I'm taking my picture up there on the wall.
You know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for a drink? Are you the other one right?

Yes, and it really scared me! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and this just pushed you.
What?! You are crazy! There is nothing sexual in the noises I make!
Really?
Is there nothing sexual about this?
Oooh.
Hate!
Ohh.
Ohhhh.
Ohh.
What are you looking at?!
I mean bye
Oh my-this is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I will never be massaged again!
No, you can not allow this to stop you from getting massages!
No, I have, I have a lot of customers who make the same noises you do!
Really?!
Well, not the customers, the lovers. But let's just know, try again. Go back and we'll work on it.
Are you sure?
Yup.
I presume.
Great! OK, if you just want to excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?

Noo !!!
Yup!
Noo !!
Yup!!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! Let them know.
Ok, here's the thing. We'll have a coffee and they'll never know you're drunk.
Really?! You promised?
Yes, I'll take care of it.
All right. I love you so much.
All right, we have to do something for your breath.
What to say
It's still yours. Ok, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you enter, act surprised.
All right. I can do it.
All right.
Surprise!!!

Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
Yes, we're done.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go and see Imax's new movie on the tide pools?
Really?!
No. But I got tickets for Knicks for you, me and Chandler.
Sweet!
All right, finish your coffee well; Here we go.
Ah, no-no-no, only Ross. Ross and Joey are quite embarrassing.
Uh, really, I'm sorry, I can not do it either. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
I understand: who would cancel an effective date to go to a false bachelor party?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel baby tonight

So it's up to these two, Nancy, I know you like this and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Well, that's nice but uh, me alone, I love this fabric Sorry.
Oh do not be sorry, it's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I'll take credit for them - I'm joking.
He's joking, but he's never in disagreement with her. Ok, I'm joking!
Oh, what a fun office.
I do not know which one, but I know I need a cigarette.
So, what do you say we take a break, let's go outside and find out when we'll be back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my father is a doctor and he always told me horrible stories about ghosts and goblins that totally supported the princess's smoking right.

What?
Fishing pit
Yes, Bunny?
Fishing pit That night we have, uh- we-
-Peaches?
In reality, nectarines, but basically ...
It could have been a fishing.
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I ... I accompanied her to ... the bus stop ... I'm fine.
Hey, that woman has an ass like that of Carol! What? I thought we were trying to find things.

All right!
Westminster Abbey!
Hands down, the best abbey I have ever seen.
Hey!
All right.
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
I think it's great. It's great. You know, they are thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? At what?
Put the car away !!!
Man,
You know, I can not believe I get my nails done! IS
Chandler, there's a guy right there.
That's a postman! That is
Chandler, do not worry! This does not make you less than a guy!
Hey, you know who had nails like that?
Hmm.

Eh ..., I do not, I do not know.
What?
Well, as old as it is in the dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Rachel?
Yes.
Do you remember when you first came here, how did you spend two weeks training another waitress?
Oh sure! Do you need me to train someone new?
Well. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to resume training every time.
Eh, do you believe it?
Yes?

Hey baby, you're the guy with the baby, you said we'd do the kind with the baby.
No, you said the baby is insinuating.
No, the child creeps me.
You said the baby.
Why does the child insinuate me?
Why does the child insinuate you?
Guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Is this happening in your book?
Yes, it's about relationships. You know? The pitfalls, pitfalls, what not to do, continue to move forward. This stuff is fantastic!
What?! I'm sorry!
And how it does not matter when people really love each other.
And how people will believe everything you say to them as long as it's a compliment.

Yes!!!!
Yes, I did it!
I'm on time!
Okay, because we do not open all our books on page 23.
Where you will see a lot of red spots.
Ok, umm, why not, why do not you start reading everyone while I-

Yes, all right. All right! Keep walking! All right?
Ross! What are you, I'm sorry, sir. Only, I think he really likes it.
Hey! Do you know that teacher who had a child with his student?
Thing? What
Hello!
To lose? Can I help you?
Okay, do not ... do not be angry, okay?
But after unpacking the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you, so I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything and then I forgot where, where he came back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
All right. Chandler, are you scared of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Obviously not.
I mean, Chandler, what you did, is, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
I know I have this strange thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I would never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
Obviously!
Oh well you are the best You come here to me.
All right, do you hold on? Starting from the beginning. Ok, now he's sitting at Ross

All right, that's all. I can not make this decision! IS
A Magic Eight ball?! You can not be serious, you can not make this decision with a toy!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I do not know what else to do.
I mean, or I keep my wife and I lose one of my-my best friends or I hold my friend and divorce the second time before I'm 30!
So, if someone has it, have a better suggestion, listen to it!
Because I ... I have nothing!
All right, do not be shy, any suggestion will.
Alright then.
Here we are.
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
Ask again later.
Later it is not good enough.
Ask again later.
What the hell!
This is broken!
It's-it's broken!
OK let me see. Chandler will have sex tonight? Do not count on it. It seems that it works for me.

I'm sorry.
Yes?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Yes.
I can get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.

I think he took it pretty well. You know that Paul is over there now, so ...
Ah ... ooh! Well, it seems, we kicked your butts.
No-no, he kicked our ass. You could be in the standing Olympic team.
Let's go, two against one.
What are you still doing here? He just broke up with the boy, it's time for you to fall in!
And now?
Yes, now it's when you fall!
You have to make sure that when Paul comes out of there, the first one that sees Rachel is you, he must know that you are all that he is not!
You're like, like the anti-Paul!
My Catholic friend is right.
She is upset.
You're there for her.
Collect the pieces and then introduce Ross's age!

Well, I just called Joshua
Oh, how did it go?
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not a crazy girl who's dying to marry - I'm having a hard time.
What he said?
Well, his answering machine was
Ohh, honey! Hey, I bet you anything will call you again.
Yes, maybe, but I do not even think that interests me.
I do not think he's the one I'm sad about.
You know, I know I said I totally agree with Ross getting married, but apparently, I do not think I'll handle it so well.
Yes, maybe.
And I - I'm just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
Well, yes, you know how we were playing again, again, again, again?
I guess I just realized that somewhere along the way, we would be up again.
Yet. You know what? I think we all did it.
Hey!
I do not understand!
He was in my room all night!
And if she did not take it, and I did not get it; and you did not get it, so who was it?
Shh!
We are trying to think!

This is unity for you, my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some large enough to fit an adult man.
What?!
Oh yeah!
I entered them once.
My roommate bet me five dollars I could not, and then stuck a blackboard between the handles that held me back.
Yes.
It was fun as long as I felt like I was in a coffin.
No, you can not adapt to that thing. It is not deep enough.
Oh yeah? If I can not, I will beat five dollars from the price of the unit.
All right, you made a deal.
All right. To see?! I told you!
Sometimes I get here just to leave! Hey, a nickel !!

Hey! What happens?
Hey!
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey !!
Hey, Joey!
Erin! Still here!
Yes, we ended up spending the day together and we had a great time!
Why should not you? Erin is great! So ... there are guys.
Ohh, listen. I have to go. Today was fantastic, thank you!

I think I reported half a beach in my hair. It was much easier when I shaved my head.
You know, I have to tell you, just
Really?!
Ohh!
Because I think I shave everything right sometimes.
Really?!
Yes!
I mean you should definitely do it.
You know what, I should do it.
Yes!
Yes, thank you, Rachel, you're so strong.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
All right.

Oh, Monica. You're not even going over that thing yet.
This woman is living my life.
What?
She is living my life, and she is doing it better than me!
Look at this, look.
Buy tickets for plays that I want to see.
She, she buys clothes from stores that are intimidated by salespeople.
He spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You are not an artist.
Yes, well I could be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all these things. Only not me.
I can not believe you would really say it. I would rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
There's no way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, it must be, like, the driest snack there is.
I do not know, you do not want to joke with corn nuts. They are crazy.
My God. You guys! You must come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I can not believe! He's looking at us!
Oh, he's so sick.
I feel violated and not in a positive sense.
How can people do it? ... Oh, guys, look! The ugly naked boy has gravity boots!

The man was fantastic! Eh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Yes, it's incredible that it lasted so long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper here.
You know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? All right? I'm

Hey, Rachel, you can pass me on
Yup!
Leave!!
What?!! Stop that! Stop that! My God!
All right! All right! All right! See you between 3 and 4 hours.
Oh!

Hey!
Hey! You've been really great! You've been really, really fantastic!
Oh, thank you, thank you.
So Monica tells me that you do not want to play anymore because I am my talent.
It's true?
Well, a little bit. Yes, yes.
Phoebe
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh all right.
What. Oh no, you just rolled on the juice box.

Hey.
I just saw a woman nursing both her twins at the same time; it's like a weird show here.
What's up?
Anything.
What is that? Hey!
It really is nothing. I am alone
How's it going, what?
I just thought about how my son and I will be all alone.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Oh please, you'll be with her real family, the twins and the new little tits.
Ok, how long have I looked at that woman?
I'm just saying that one day, Ross will meet someone and have a life of his own. Right?
Yes, I think so.
I never thought I would raise this child alone. Pretty stupid eh?
Bob. Bob! Bob !!! What the hell are you doing ?!
I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on, give me a hand!

Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffee at six.
We said seven!
We said you are!
The only way I said you would be if the seven, meet at seven, not six.
Yes, and if I had seven, I might have said something like this, "Wow, my boyfriend is such a wise seven-seven!"
Hello!
Oh my good God
Ugh!
I know what time you said.
What?!
Well, actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
You, get out of my shop!
Well, what did you do?
He came out with my wife!
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did it
That's my wife!!! Go out!
Well, we should go.
Yes.

You know, you really did not have to take me to the airport.
Oh please.
Every moment is precious
You know?
Besides, someone had to ride that other taxi with the rest of the baggage, and your friends do not really seem to care that you're leaving too much.
Well, we're not really that close. Ok, so I guess this is, bye then.
On no! No! It's not goodbye, I will not leave until you get on that plane.
No, I'm afraid I will not be able to make love like him.
Yes, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the true words.
So big, so Joey has a lot of girls, does not mean he's good at bed.
We share a wall! So either she's fantastic in bed, or she just likes to agree with him.
Honey, with you it will be different. Sex will be fantastic, because you - you guys are in love.
Yes?
Yes!
Just go Chandler.
Yes, you should.
Yes, you should, really.
Go ahead.
All right, all right, I'll go to sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm doing it just for you guys.

: I'm sure as a dancer, Marge will never use me.
Come on Treeger, do not say that.
You alone ahh, you only need more practice.
Here, let's go, let's go, let's try again.
Come on.
Besides, it was, probably it was mainly my fault, anyway.
I mean, you know, I'm not so comfortable dancing with a ... We-He !!
Hey!
: Yes!

Oh, me
Are you sure? I bet there is another flight to Minsk
July. Umm,
It's very nice. What does it mean?
Please, clean my glasses. I do not go out much from the lab.
That's good. I have to admit, I thought it was something else.
Yes, I Well, actually I really wanted to say that, but, um, I thought I probably should not because, you know, I have to leave.
You are right! You are right. Do not say that
I-I do though.
I do it too.
Hi Phoebe.
Ok, it's not the moment Joey. All right? You can yell me against tomorrow.
I know.
Oh-oh, wait, did you hear that?
Listen, I'm getting something from your grandmother, you said that since you have to keep the one bedroom apartment, should you give Rachel the purple chair?
No, I do not hear it.

Yes I've heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh, well, it's great!
Yes! Yes!
I can not believe you marry!
Yes.
Monica and Rachel understood.

Ohhh!
Why are we in bed together?
I do not know. Do you have any clothes?
Yes.
Really?!
No!
But we ... we did not have sex ... did it?
I mean, I do not remember much of last night, it was such a blur.
Oh! I remember having laughed! I laughed a lot.
And we did not have sex.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm glad I did not do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.

What we will do?
I say that we go with
Chandler?
Have you already seen us? Did you see us?
Janice, what are you doing here?
What's that smell?
I know!

Hello, remember us?
Um, ok You just called a few minutes ago to need a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need one
I'm. I'm
Yes, and and, I will pay for this with a check.
Yes, I know ... I too am not so bright.

Hey, Monday, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one would you wear?
You know what? it
Sorry.
I'm so excited!
I've been waiting for this for months!
I have colored hair!
I have new sheets!
I'm doing it to
Um-hmm.
By the way, what am I doing?
Well, you're making a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild walnuts, wild rice, roasted asparagus and salmon on the back.
I thought I'd give him a filet mignon?
Yes, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you left it in the restaurant.
And then you realized that if I cursed you, you'd stop cooking and you'd have to prepare your famous baked potato and the Diet Coke.
Wow, I really laugh when I cook.

Chandler! It happens to many guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, do not worry!
I'm not worried, I'm ... I'm fascinated
You know, it's like ... Biology!
Which is funny because in high school I, I ... I failed biology and tonight the biology disappointed me.
Check it out. Ok, I can play when the guests arrive. Okay.
Phoebe!
If you let me finish, he would still say that he's probably not gay.

You are falling deeply asleep.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Now you are completely asleep.
It is not necessary to smoke.
Cigarettes do not control you.
You are a strong and sure woman, who does not need to smoke.
A strong and confident woman.
Thanks for your patience, you're the next caller.
Yup!! Yup!! I'm the next caller! You would have me hanging up.
Hey! Can you bring a duck and a girl to the theater?
Obviously not.
No.
All right. I just wanted them to hear from someone else.

So, how are things going with Paul?
Good.
Even if you know, he's a private boy.
You know, I wish I could open it up a bit, share some feelings.
This is easy! You just have to think of it as a jar of pickles that does not open.
So what are you saying? Should I let him run under warm water and bang his head against a table?
No, this is what you do when you want to get the truth from someone.
Hi sweetie.
Hello!

Okay, Ben, I will not tell your father that you ate an ice cream for dinner, if you did not mention our little incident.
Monica, number one, I do not think Ben understands the concept of corruption, and the number two, I ... What ?!
You said the number two.
I also said the number one.
Remind me to check with you which jar is decaffeinated and which is regular.
Can not I just look at the handles on them?
You'd think.
OK well.
Gunther, you know what, I'm a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible maid?
Because, I do not care.
I do not care
I do not care which dish is regular and which dish is decaffeinated, I do not care where the tray is, I do not care, this is not what I want to do.
So I do not think I should do it anymore.
I'll give you the notice of my weeks.
What?!
Gunther, I stopped.
Does this mean we have to start paying for coffee?

Ohh, I mean, it's so realistic!
I know. Yes, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I see!!
Are you ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably should not ... so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it rains!
Very cute, eh?
But if you're thinking that you can put a fish in there and it would not get sucked into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's right here.
All right. God, you know, if someone had told me a week ago that I'd pee in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
Yes, life is pretty, right?
Yes sure!

You know, I think I'm sixteen.
Please, just a little bit behind.
I'm still in "no".
Uh, morning. Guys, do you think you can close your eyes just for a second?
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not thinking about it yet.
What is happening?
Well, I did a stupid thing last night.
What stupid did you do?
Ewww!

I know.
See, yes.
It's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different girl.
I love you both.
But in very different ways.
Hey!
Hey!
(sees that he is watching
I did it! But the store would not take her back! So I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
If they can not find a home for her, they kill her! And I will not let that happen to little Yasmine!
Ok, well, well, well, because, well, because I had a change of mind too.
All right. And they're not just chicks, you know? They are all kinds of other animals!
It's horrible! Well, you did the right thing, man.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!

So, Chandler, did you hear about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Uhh, yes. She, she, she, she could have mentioned it.
So, Monday, when will we meet this new secret waiter?
Ohh, it's really shy. I-I do not think she's still able to meet everyone.
Yes, I do not think he's still able to meet everyone.
I do not care! I want to meet this guy who is the best sex I've ever had!
Really?! This is what you heard? You said that?
I could have said it. Why is it so funny?
Because I'm very happy for him! IS
Hello!
All right, well, I can not think of it right now. I just want to say goodbye to my grandma.
All right.
All right, let's say goodbye.

Hey!
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and get me out of the apartment?
Honey, if I wanted to do it, I might as well give it a fish, you know how the fish scared me!
Fish!
It would not matter, Phoebe, you and me, we'll live together, we're roommates; this is the deal.
Yes, but I wanted you to live with me, but ok, if you're having so much fun here
Oh, it's a lot more fun with you.
We had fun, right?
We did!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see him tonight.
Oh, I'd like to!
Okay okay!
Good, good, good, good, good.
All right, all right, and Monica asks me to stop the drum.
Um ... Done!

Sei, hey, you're not paying for pizza!
Oh come on, it's right, you paid the flight. Now is it, is it enough Lira?
Ah, I'd throw another thousand on this.
Why, how much is it?
It's about 60 cents.
Ok, it's a coffee.
Cold coffee? Tell me it's a frozen coffee!
It's-it's hot
Hot coffee !!!
Idiot!!
You would have poured some hot coffee over me, eh? !!
What are you just a big idiot, stupid, stupid, idiot, with a stupid idiot hairstyle, eh ?!
Eh?
!
What's your favorite thing about summer?
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light very late.
Yes
Hey!
Tommyyyy! Tell me, what's your favorite thing about summer?
Ooh, I do not know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Oh, that's good.

OK, try this salmon mousse.
Mmmm. Good.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It is more creamy.
Yes, well, that's it
I do not know. We're talking about fried fish, Monica. I'm just glad I kept it hidden, you know?
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests ... and what do I learn?
"You are perfectly suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational company."
Is fantastic! Because you already know how to do it!
You can believe? I mean, it does not seem to me that someone should actually do something
Oh Chandler, I know, I know ... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here, maybe this will cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better share it with you.

I thought it would be a closed casket.
Well, that does not mean it can not look nice!
Honey, do you think you can get in there?
I do not see why not.
Here is my catch!

Someone in there?
No. This is just a part of a devil devil that game called "wait until the last moment before bursting and dying".
Heck, buddy, you fell .. Hello! So, ah, did you really do it?
Someone was in the lady's room, I could not wait. I left the cover for you though.
You know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm talking to ah ,. This is the part where you say your name.
Ginger.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so ....
Do not you have to use the bathroom?
No, no, I'd just like to ah, I'd rather talk to you.
Sure.
Yes, I have to go to the bathroom.
Someone in here

I will continue to go out with my mother, and there is nothing you can do about it!
Oh yes, there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? How did you do with Charles ?!
It was an accident! And so it was you.
Well, at least I'm not a killer!
Oh, my baby!
It was a great scene! E-e-and that slap seems so real! How do you do it?
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I have ice here?
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say that I think you're wonderful.
You're not the dying fan are you?
What?
I should meet and hug a dying fan, but it should not be before!
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I - I'm the guy in a coma!
Oh was that a real person ?!
An-an-any-I-I just wanted to say that since I'm taking your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there were any advice you can give me
I-I-I will leave the show?
I do not know. Why? Did you hear something?
Who told you that?
Oh, one of the writers.
Which? Was he bald or was he tall?
Umm

Feeling better?
Yes!
Much!
Listen, not that I'm insecure about my manhood or anything you know, but I think I need to be with a woman like now.
Yes, I see.
Yes! All right! Hey! Hello!
Hello!
You know, you look familiar. Did we see each other somewhere?
I do not think so
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on
Wow!
Yes.
Really?!
HM-mmm.
$ 4.50 please.
Oh, let me understand this. These are for you.

All right, all right, all right.
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you have not said a word yet.
Oh God, do something.
Just contact, smile!
Here it is!
You're definitely scaring here.
Would you like to call someone?
Yes, around 300 guys went to school with.

All right! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you that those contracts are not on this desk.
Oh
And my sister.
Ok, very nice braces. Anyway, you know what, the
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a

Phoebe, you do not know that you wake up every night, do not know that you find yourself every morning and do not know that you lived with your grandmother for a week.
Ok, well maybe not on those levels.
Hey.
Hey.
I will never find a roommate, ever.
Why, nobody's okay?
Well, let's see, there was the guy with ferrets, it's plural.
The spitter.
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy who loved my name so much felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
So how many do you still have tomorrow?
Two.
This photographer, who looked really boring.
And this actor, of which I'm not sure, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing', he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message'.
Ross, foot on the floor or do not come anymore!
Sure, your dresser is missing, but you notice it.
What?
I have to go. Yes, Carol should be home now, so ...
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Oh, better, actually. You know, I_I_I think I finally understood why we were having so many problems lately.
Oh really?
Yes, you know how I have you guys, well, he does not really have close friends that are just his, but last week he met this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really understood, and III think they will make a difference

Hey!
Hello!
What-what are-what are these?
Oh, just some pictures I did and hung up. I thought they would cheer up the place. They do not believe?
No-no-no, no!
Well, why?
It's just that.
This is crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and jackets, but you're not in a perfect world, you're in a museum now.
See that scientist in the classes, he and I always played together with the elementary, but now Peter!
Hey, Peter!
It's me Rhonda!
From PS-129!
I shared my puddin 'which you man!
I gave you mine
I think everyone pretends not to hear you.
Anyway, look, I do not know about you, your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a place, I tell you, he
All right, I'm right here. I'll join you later, Joey.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.

How come coffee comes, 'dear?
Yes, immediately Mr. Kaplan.
I should not drink coffee, it drives me crazy.
I know!
I bet your thinking, 'What's a smart girl who wants to be in fashion, make coffee?' Eh?
Operation.
Eh.
Oh, you got me
Well, do not think you did not notice your potential.
Well, I have a project for you that is much more tied to fashion.
How do you think?
Oh, it sounds fantastic.
Come here sweetheart.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you very much.
Well, I knew, I was alone, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, er, maybe you'd like to go back together?
No. But thanks.
Aw how on Phoebe do you think about it?
All right. No. But thanks.
Okay, see you Phoebe.
Wow, it was a bit brutal.
Well, let this be a lesson for all of you, all right.
Once you, once you betray me, I become like an ice woman, you know.
Very cold, hard, inflexible, you know nothing,
Yes sure.

Wow.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry too. But, I have to tell you, I'm a little relieved.
Lifted up?
Yeah, well, I had a lot of fun with you ... I can not stand your friends.

She wants
My God! If you say it again,
Well!
Well!
But this break was not all my fault, and she says here, "If you accept full responsibility ..." Full responsibility!
'... I can start trusting you again.
It seems you can do something.
It does ?!
! '
No?
Listen, Ross, you got what you want, you came back with Rachel.
If you bring it here, you would destroy the best thing that happened to you.
Yes I know.
I mean, no, you're right.
Yes, I think I'll let go.
But you, you understand how difficult it is to forget this.
Of course, it's hard to forget!
But this does not mean you have to talk about it!
On that journey, many things happened that we should never talk about.
What the hell happened on that beach ?!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!

I did not think you were gay. I know.
See my friend, my friend, Rachel, wants to be settled.
Ahh, I just came out of a great relationship, I'm not looking for anything serious.
Oh, you know what, it could be fine even if it was just some kind of adventure, it could be okay with Rachel.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, Rachel, what did you bring to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, this is his full name.
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Oh, wait a second! I did not say I was not free!
Hey, Chandler, why do not we talk about this to tomorrow's Ranger?
Wait, you know
Oh well, um, a little later than me, generally I'm interested in being, but of course!
Perhaps, before the game, we could enjoy a small group of eight years, Basel Hadens.
Well, I do not really know what it is, but

Monica, let's go. Now let's go people, woman in labor.
Hey, Ross, look what I'm going here.
Yes, save it for the taxi, okay.
What are you doing? Let's go to a hospital.
What, so I can not speak well? There may be doctors there.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
All is well all right.
What is that?
For the trip
Yes, like in a taxi ...
Save it.
Ok, hating this.
Monica, let's go now. Come on, baby coming.
I can not believe it, I'll be an aunt. I will have like a nephew.
Beautiful. Come out, let's go.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Here we go, here we are.
Rossy, Rossy.

WHAT IS THAT?!
All right, I - I know, you - you - you have a quality.
Yes, absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, well, because I was worried that you guys would be vague about this.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it is Paul who calls from Rome.
My God! Calling from Rome!
So he's calling from Rome. I could do it. I just have to go to Rome.
Monica, your father just played, but can you do it quickly? Talk with Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Hey dad, how are you? Oh God. Ross, I'm Nana.

So, then, how are you, you came to see me yesterday.
Oh yes, um, all right, I need a divorce.
Oh yes, yes, of course. We live in the building near the sidewalk.
You know?
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and everyone, what do you say we get together for a drink?
Oh, sure, they love us there.
Well! Well! Well!

Dateglieli!
No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!
You stole them from me !!
Give them to me!
Do you just want to get one?
Yes, it seems right. We never use them.
Listen, I really need help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak with a British accent? What I do?
Well
Why do not you delete it?
Yes, the accent will fade and people will think you are, you know, that you are adapting to life in America.
Yes, I mean, come Ross, no one will even notice. I mean, they probably are not even listening!
Are not they listening to me?
Of course they are listening to you! Everyone hears you.
Monica, do you really think I should try this thing out of phase?
I think you're fine.

How about Joey ... Pepponi?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a more neutral name.
Joey ... Switzerland?
Besides, you know, I think it should be Joe.
You know, Joey makes me look like me, I do not know, so big.
That I am not
Joe ... Joe ... Joe ... Stalin?
Stalin ... Stalin ... do I know that name? It seems familiar.
Well, do not ring a bell with me ...
Joe Stalin. You know, it's pretty good.
You could try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin. I think you would remember it!
Oh yes! Bye bye Birdie, played by Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the violinist on the roof.

Are you kidding?
Ok, look.
I-I studied evolution.
Remember, evolution?
Monkey in the man?
Besides, I'm a doctor and I've had a monkey.
I'm Doctor Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
You are both idiots.
The joke is not fun, and it's offensive to women, doctors and monkeys!
You should not discuss who gets credit, you should discuss who is blamed for inflicting this horrible joke into the world!
Now let it go!
The joke sucks!
It's your joke.
It is not.

Hi everyone, Rachel was so good today. She did not gossip at all.
I did not!
Even when I discovered umm, all right, let's just say that I discovered something about someone and say that she will keep it.
Hey, Phoebe! Check-check this.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yes, listen so, I thought I was getting better, so, while I was coming home, I stopped by this guitar shop and
You did it?
No.
Give me your hands. Strings. Give me the courage! Choose. Do you want to learn how to play the guitar?
Yup!
So do not touch one !!
Really? Would you have done it for me?
Yes!
Thank you!
Well, we'll start slowly. The only thing you need to do tonight is find the name of your main character.
Done!
And it can not be Joey.
It is not.
Or Joseph.
Oh.

Hello!
Hello! Hey, Pete, you're back! Hey, take a look.
Wow! Skates!
Wow! You're much sturdier than Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how were you traveling?
Well...
Oh, what did you bring me ?!
Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
Oh, these will go to my permanent collection.
do you want a coffee?
Yes, of course, it would be great.
Regular or decaffeinated?
Ah, which is always the closest.
All right.
So ask me what I did today.
So, what did you do today, Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to become the chef.
What?! Oh.

Hello.
Hey.
Where have you been?
To the vet
It will not make you wear one of those big plastic cones, right?
He says that Marcel's stuff is not a phase. Apparently he has reached sexual maturity.
Hey! He beat you.
He says that over time, he will begin to become aggressive and violent.
What does this mean?
I have to let it go.

Aww man! I can not believe I closed myself out again!
Wait for a friend!
My God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
I certainly did it.
But we have not seen each other since. Well, I'm coming to China, guess who's responsible for the excavation.
Julie! Julie, is not it fantastic? I mean, is not it just a kick in the ass, spit on the neck fantastic?

Can I come in?
Uh, yes, if you want it too.
Do
Yes sure?
Me too.
Okay, Rach, before something happens, I just want to establish a couple of basic rules.
This is only for tonight.
I will not do it if it raises the question of "We".
All right?
I just want it to be for what it is!
Um, what ... what is that Ross?
The physical act of love.
What?! You are crazy?
Oh, so you were not trying to lure me now with your nakedness?
Oh God, did you see me ?! Oh!
You were not trying to lure me with your nudity.
Noo !! No! You thought, did you really think I wanted to have sex with you ?!
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Ohh wow! Excuse me, but Ross you took your shoes off!
Well, are you just going out with Ross?
Everything is alright! OK Bye Bye! She ... will kill me.
Yes, the phone was facing the other side. And that goes up there.

Ah Joey.
Joey Tribbiani.
Listen, Joey, I have a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and he can not get out of Long Island.
So, does this mean that the hearing is deactivated?
Listen to Joey, since you have the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
What?!
Aw like on Joey, it's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand, head, head, on, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big break here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz!
They are the hands ah, step-it, step and jazz.
Have a good time.
Hello.

Wow! Fortunately she has a
Oh, I can not believe it! Is my uterus an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Oh, I can not believe my sperm has a low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they seemed to be in a hurry to get seats!
!
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm sorry there were no better news from your test last week, but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Ok.
Above all, even if your chances of conceiving by natural means are not great, you never know!
So, keep on having sex regularly.
Oh, DAMAGE IT!
Do not worry, after a while it will tune.
Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chance of success would be surrogacy or insemination with a sperm donor.
Ok.
Well, you know, monogamy can be a ... a complicated concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Beautiful. Well, all right, now you'll never know.
We are joking. Come on, say it!
Yes! Come on, come on!
Alright. There is a theory, put forward by Richard Leakey-

Hi, is Carol here?
No, it's at a faculty meeting.
Oh, I just came to get my skull. Well, not mine, but ...
Come in.
Thank you. Yes, Carol borrowed it for a lesson, and I have to bring it back to the museum.
Such as?
A bit like a big, skinless face.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can only look for it.
Ok. Wow, you guys definitely have a lot of books on how to do a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they will not let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the child.
The child, who is not yet born? Does not that mean you're ... crazy?
What, do not you think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really ... do you really talk to us?
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up, man?
I'm trppd ... in an ATM vstbl ... wth
My God! He is trapped in an ATM atrium with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yes, as if that thought had never entered my mind.

and this was all before 10 o'clock.
The catering service rang and said it would be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
And then the florist called to say that there are no tulips.
Oh, and the little one has the carpel-tunel syndrome.
We will not be
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Well, yours too!

Where's Chandler?
Ah, he can not do it, he said he had his ... Whoa-oh!
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey, do I see you well? You're hiding behind the coats.
Ok, listen, just give me what I can do two of.
Well, if you have nothing to copy, why are you going over there?
Yeah, are you just going over there staring at that sexy girl with the navel ring again?
Yes! You want to come?
Yes!

Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
All right. We will go. It is not for another six hours. We will go then.

Hey.
What's up?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! I licked my neck !!
Oh Willie is still alive!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, my mother called, they'll make our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, I'm afraid it does not exist.
It's not true, there are some nice pictures of us!
No, there are great photos of you standing next to a guy who's going like that
My God! That's the creep you're with
I do not know what it is, I can not make a good figure.
Oh, here's a big one.
Yes, I'm not here.
I know, but look at me: all tan.
Hey, why do not you go for portraits made by a professional photographer.
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! you know
It is fantastic! Beside that, Chandler will not look so stupid.
Chandler, what are you talking about?
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.

I was also the reference person on the transition of my company from the KL-5 system to the GR-6 system.
You must have had your hands full.
What I did. What I did.
Let's talk a little about your duties.
My duties? All right.
Now you will be in charge of an entire division, so you will have many duties.
I see.
But there will be maybe 30 people under you so you can download a certain amount on them.
Good to know.
We can go into the details
No, please do not!
All right, we'll have a definitive answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence that you'll be fine here.
Really?!
Absolutely. You can relax; you did well.
But then who? The waitress came out with last month?
You know? Forget about it!
No-no-no-no, no! Whose person were you talking about?
No, I_I_I_I do not, actually I do not know
Ok!
All right, good ...
I'll see if I can find a room for the night and I ...
See you later!
Yes sure!

Hey, Monday
Hey Hey Hey. You want to hear something that sucks.
I never do it.
Chris says they're closing the bar.
There's no way!
Yes, apparently they are turning it into a type of coffee.
Only coffee! Where will we go out now?
You got me
Can I have a beer
Hey, did you choose a roommate?
I bet!
Is he the Italian boy?
Um-mm, yes right!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What what what ?!
What?!
He was with her when he wrote this poem.
Look, 'My ship is so empty with nothing in it.
Now that I have touched you, you seem even more empty. "
Think that Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Do you really think that's what he meant?
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Done.

Hey!
Hello!
What are you doing here?
Ah, you know, this building is on my paper path so ...
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
How did it go?
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but thank God, Mark trained me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she became happy and did not want to be quiet.
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry for being so crazy and jealous and it's just that I like you a lot, so ...
I know.
Yes.
Yes.
American.
Ameri-Ccan.
American. You know, it's a
All!!

Good job Joe! Very well! First quality!
Did you like it? Did you really like it?
Oh-ho-ho, yes!
Which part exactly?
The whole thing! We can go?
Oh no-no-no, give me some details.
I love the specifications, the specifications were the best part!
Hey, and the scene with the kangaroo? Did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in an epic from the First World War.
You fell asleep!!
There was no kangaroo!
They did not take any of my suggestions!
This is for the next friend.
See you later.
Do not go!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!
Look!
This boy fell asleep!
He too fell asleep!
Be angry with him!
Or call an ambulance.

Ok, look, I think we have to tell Rachel that she messed up her dessert.
What?! What is with everyone? It's Thanksgiving, not ... The day of truth!
Yes, and it is my desire to die of having that ring.
See, if I am not buried with that ring, then my spirit will wander the lower world for all eternity
Ok, it's enough for me!
I do not know. Show me the ring.
Great! Ok, here.
All right.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! IS

What have you done?
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying too much.
Oh, and in case you're wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you wait a moment? I have another call. I love her.
I know.
I'm back.
So, will we meet or what?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how's it going tomorrow afternoon? You know, Central Perk in the Village, for example, five-ish?
Well, see you then.
Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid.
Even if you make a good impression on Bob, I think when he sees you tomorrow, he'll probably realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
I hope that when Bob does not show up, he will seek comfort in the open arms of the ironic stranger at the next table.
My God. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I did it

Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You would not believe what people put here!
Look!
Ok, this looks like a trash can?
No.
This is my marriage
All right, you know what? We are really late! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!!
Beautiful. You'll see it on video when we come back.
Here go Phoebe! Here go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
OK let's go! Hi, Phoebe!
Hi, Phoebe!
Little London !!
Oh, do you need a hug? You do not have to bring me anything!

Hey!
Hey! So Estelle has organized a couple of hearings for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance in no time.
It's great, but should not you be in the bathroom right now?
What?!
What's wrong with you?
Anything!
Well, I had this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights first, then I fainted and since then I have not been able to stand up.
But um, I do not think it's serious.
It looks like a hernia. You must-you-go to the doctor!
There's no way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it will be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
It is a hernia.
Why do I have to start working again? Damn you 15s!

I love your place! Where is this guy coming from?
This is an 18th century Indian artifact of Calcutta.
Oh wow! So you are more than just a dinosaur.
Much more.
Well, to sum up, we're having fun, you're young.
All right
But it's not enough. So, here is a key to my apartment.
Really?!
Really.
Do not you think it's too fast.

Go out!
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes thanks! So, what's going on?
Uh, well ... Joey and I broke up.
Oh my God, what happened?
Joey is a good guy, but we're just ... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
I knew it was him!
Anyway, I think it's the best.
Hey, are you okay?
I presume.
There was a buzz ... there was another reason why I thought it was time to close it with Joey.
I started to realize that I was feeling for someone else.
Ok Geller. On the last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Oh, professor, we're in the middle of a conversation here.
Yes, can you guys throw it in the pool later?
Or we could throw you both inside
OK, gentlemen!
Please!
Are not we old for this?
I mean, we're scientists, right?
We are academics.
And, more importantly, I ... you must first catch it.
.
STREET! STREET! STREET!

Street! Street! Street!
Oh yes, now everyone wants to be under this hat!
Oy !!
What's all this sand?
Oh yes, Bob said there could be flood damage.
Yes, or that, or have a really big cat.

Ok, see that blind right there? I will chase his head later.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming. Great scene coming soon.
If you said: "Big bean of a file, that boils". Will you understand the difference?
Rachel? What are you doing?
Oh boy, I can not watch. It's too scary!
It's a diaper advertisement.
Oh yes, well, you know me, children, responsibility, ahhh !!!
Pizza delivery!
I'll get it! I'll take it!
Hello!
Hello!
Hey, do you want something to eat or want to see how long can we throw this ball back and forth? Eh?
Uhh, the thing about the ball.
Yes?
Hey, Ross, would not it be nice if we could go two hours without letting her fall?
uhh,
All right!
Uh Oh.
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel is in the bathroom!
Friend, I did not think we could do it!
I know! Do not change hands, ok?

Hey.
Hey!
How did you go with Erin?
Oh, incredible! We had great fun!
Yay!! Oh, you're not, are you no longer angry with us?
No!
No!
No!
You guys are completely right!
This is much better than the first time we went out.
You know?
It was so embarrassing, we were really nervous.
Did not you sleep together?
Yes, this really reassures me.
IS!
We have so much in common!
Love the sandwiches, the sport, even if you are a fan of the Met, it's not a big deal now, but if we ever have children, well this is a
My God! Listen, you talk about having children. Oh my Joey. Oh, please do not get married before me.
All right.

How do you do it?
I can not sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Oh! What what thing! ...Hello.
All right, you know, you just nodded again.
What's going on with you?
I did not sleep last night!
Why?
My grandma has this new boyfriend and they are both insecure in bed.
Oh, and deaf.
So they are constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they are having fun.
You have no idea how strong they are!
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thank you.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
It is only his water that breaks. Calm down, do you want?
Water that breaks, what do you mean? What is a water break?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

You are crazy? I mean Joey, he will kill you, he will actually kill you dead.
All right! Do not you think I thought about it?
How can you not know which one?
I mean it's incredible.
I mean, was it Gina?
What is Gina?
Dark and big hair, with airplane earrings.
No, no, no, that's Dina.
See that you can not say what it is or not, dwha !!
I do not know, you thought "see you Saturday" was fun.
Look, honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend with whom I can share this stuff.
You guys would never want to go to a class with me.
Pa-haa !! I'd like to come with you.
Really!?
Yes, hey I-I have clothes, I pick them too.
I mean, for all you know, I could be a fashion ... more powerful.
All right. Honey, I'd like you to come with me. What?
What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.

: I know, we did it !! Hey, it was incredible, eh ?!
I know, it was great! I mean, we completely nailed it, it was beautiful.
: Thank you, listen, thank you so much Tribbiani ,. Oh my God, look at the time, I have to take the bus to the ball.
Oh, all right, good luck
: Yes.
Unless you want to practice Foxtrot again? Or or the Tango?
: Ahh, thanks but no. See, I think I'm ready to dance with the girls.
All right.
: Yes.
Go look for them, Treeger.
: Right. Hey, do you want to come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really?
: Yes, you could dance really well with her, she's the same size as me.
No, I'm fine.

Oh God, this is so unnerving! How do you do this?
Well, unfortunately, I do not have many callbacks
Is it a good sign that they asked us to stay around after the audition?
Who knows?
Okay, we narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yup!! I knew it!! Bye Bye! So long! After!
Oh, it's great! I could really play Ben's father!
Yes!
In reality, this can not happen.
Yes, because you all look so different, we are putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
So it will be either you or two of you.
Friend, it will be a little strange.
Yes it is.
No, we'll be like best friends, that's why it will be weird.

Ok, come on, I can not marry until I have something old, something new, something lent and something blue.
All right, all right, all right, all right! All right! Ok, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Please!
Are you kidding?
I ... I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a damn nose - I mean - I'm not proud of it, but I really am.
And it's all for you, wonderful, fantastic.
I think you have a concussion.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
You are welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Pain is worth it. You know what, you know what? It is not.

Wow! Mike's thing was interesting! I do not know what will happen with Phoebe and David.
I want it! Do you want a suggestion? eh? "I do" "I do".
Ok, I'm sensing that it's a kind of word game, because you're rose with barely controlled joy.
David is about to propose to Phoebe.
What? Why?
Be-Cause, we were talking about ways he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Chandler, we talked about it.
You should not give advice to people!
Now you could not have done some kind of inappropriate joke?
I
They've only been out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely stunned by Mike!
She will say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too difficult for them to recover and Phoebe will end up alone
Friend, this is a bit
Oh, that's not what you want ...

This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, it's Ross Geller.
It's nice to meet you Paul.
Usually I prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to call me Mr. Stevens.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
So Ross, what's your problem?
Eh-wh-excuse me?
Why can not you have a girl your age?
It is funny. Umm. It's not funny.
I
All right.
I can, I can see it.
Umm, but I think if you give me a chance, I can change my mind.
All right.
What?
All right. I'll give you a chance to change your mind. Do you have a minute.
Pope!
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Ok, well, I'll bring you a ribbon, eh?
So, do you have any Matt Lauer clothes here now? Could be? Only those who have not been cleaned yet?

Ooooohh!
Oh yes, I'm sure. And suddenly his hands were no longer the problem.
Was...?
Oh, the Boy Scouts could have camped there.
"Ooo", what?
Uma Thurman.
Oh!
The actress!
Thanks, Rach.
So, what are you going to do?
You must tell him!
You must tell him!
It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist question!
Guys?
Guys?
Oh yes, you have to tell him.
Feminist Problem That's where I went!
He will hate me.
Yes good...

Do you want to marry me?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you luck!
Yes, yes, do you have a ring?
Yes, right here in my pocket. Phoebe?
Oh! Oop!
Ok, now you're going out of here? I want this to be a surprise and she will know it.
Yes, yes, guys. Go out of here!
Hi guys.
You are beautiful.
Oh thanks! What is going on?
We are really very excited about this charity event we have to go to.

Ok, um, Ross?
I'm very hot, so I'll take off my sweater.
Now I'm just letting you know that this is it
Yup! It is funny!
I'm sorry. I finished. I finished.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. I mean, you saw me naked a hundred times.
Uh Huh. But it was the first time for the rest of my building.
All right. All right, it's true! But you only know that I do not easily embarrass him.
What?! You are totally embarrassed!
No I do not know! Ross, I think I'm just a safer person than you.
Is that so?
Yes.
Hey girl! I do not care how much you want it! All right?! I'm

I can not believe!
I did it!
I drove a bike!
I never thought I would be able to do it!
Thanks, Ross.
Oh hey, do not thank me, thank you. You are the one who has faced his fears and in the end has overcome them.
Well, yes, but then
Yes-No-ma-ma-ma-ma! We will go home and take a shower. Now, it's not scary, is it?
It depends on what you mean with us.

Hey, you guys both should be up there with me.
I mean, you two are ... it's me, I mean, I'm lucky to have only one good
Thanks man.
I have to go check something out here.
What a baby.
Total Wuss!

David?
Phoebe! Hello!
My God!
Wow, you look incredible.
Yes. What-what are you doing here?
Well, I came back from Minsk ... permanently.
What happened?
Well, remember how I was trying to get positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Yes?
Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can not be done.
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
Well, well, life is good ...
Good!
Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
Oh, good for you.
She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and ... well, it's actually thanks to you, really, that we're together, that is, I saw what you had with that guy from Mike, and I just said "Boy , I want it".
Mike and I broke up.
It means we can keep trying, but chances are good that this never happens for us.
My God!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Well, we'll do it ... we'll find out.
I know.

Ok, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes to try.
Wow! This looks fantastic!
Yes! Ok, this is a mushroom hat. Umm, this is made of bologna.
E-e-e-e-e toothpicks?
You kissed another woman!
Call it too?
All right!
Well, I'm going to get them in the water.
Wait you stole those from these people's marriage?
No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby.
Yes, they think they can make me pay for a dirty movie and a lot of Mashuga nuts, they have another thought coming up.
Hey!
My sweater!
I've been looking for him for a month!
My God!!
My God!

Happy?! Is that what I should be Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you should be!
Eh?
Because for sure I can not understand it!
I talk to you and nothing.
You look at me, and it's nothing.
Anything.
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel that you guys have a story, it's ... it's beautiful.
I have a question about this scene.
Yup?
Well, I do not understand why Adrienne is attracted to Victor.
Peel the onion First of all, it is good-looking.
Yes.
I think my character will need another bit of reason.
Oh, hey, how about this.
Ah, he says it in the script!
You know ah, I-I do not know why my character is nice too, I mean he says in the script you're a bitch.
He does not say it in the script.
He does it in mine!

I can not
Yes! You must tell a girl before registering. Such a beginner's mistake.
Do you know who has a big video camera?
Greg and Jenny?
Do you still want to call them? I want to call them.
Let's call them.
Yes! Ask them if they brought some souvenirs to their friends!
Hello? Eighth street food?
Hey, hang up! You have food poisoning that only talks in that place.
Uh sorry, wrong number.
Here it is.
Hello? It is again the gastronomy!
All right! I will have a sandwich!
I do not think this number is right!
Oh come on !!

I have to go. I miss you too, I love you, but now it's getting very late
Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with dr. Bazida and ... Excuse me? Did you know it's not Ma?
His name is Ronni. She is a misfit.
Sure. So how long ...
Remember when you were a kid, I took you to the navy yard and showed you the big ships?
Since?!
No, it's only been six years.
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head, so you'd know I was not always such a terrible guy.
... Joe.
Have you ever been in love?
... I know.
So you will not do it. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk.
Joe, your father is in love with the big one. And the worst part is that it's with two different women.
Oh God. Please tell me that one of them is Ma.
Of course, of course, one of them is Ma. What's the problem with you?

Everything will be fine. Ok, Dick?
Hi, I'm Guru Saj - Whoa !! It should be a duck, right? Because otherwise, this is out of my reach.
Hey, Rach, what was the job like?
Oh great. Even though I sat there where there was not a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped a box of your stuff.
Oh, well, I think I did.
I'll throw it out, it's probably just a little shampoo and ...
Something wrong?
Nothing.

And then, and then you said that, about bringing the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Yes, it is?
Yes.
Yes!!
We're teeth, Zack people!

Friend, I'm sorry for what I said!
No, no, you're right, it's a ridiculous name!
It's not that bad.
Yup! From now on, I do not have the first name.
So you're just Bing?
Because we won our apartment!
What? Ace is tall! Jack, queen, king, ace!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I do not know. Ooh! Ooh! Watch it! Ah-ha!
All right, cut, resume, resume.
All right.
Come to the apartment! Come to the apartment! Oh! I know the queen is tall!
Uh-huh, not as high as it worked! King!
Yeah baby!
But let's get back! We choose again!
Why?!
I do not know!
Tickets please! This is the backyard child!
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so angry for? They bring the apartment back!
No they did not!

You know, I do not think we've brought enough things. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
It will be worth it.
It is known that women love children, all right?
Women love boys who love children.
It's all sensitive.
Soon, point it at that pack of girls there.
Perhaps one of them will break away.
No, no, wait, to get them, we have one, hard on the left.
All right, give me the baby.
No, I got it.
No, seriously.
Oh, seriously, do you want it?
Hello.
Well, do not do it, do not think immodest, but me?
Do you want to hear it?
Oh yeah. He has that great smell as a child. Get a breath of his head.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
Well, we're big boys.
Hello.

Well, not really.
I mean technically it's - it's not against the rules or anything, but it's frowned upon.
Especially from that professor we came across last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well, Ross, be careful now. You do not want to have a reputation as you know Professor McNailshststudents.
Yes. What-what should I do?
Well, Ross, it seems clear enough.
I mean, what's more important?
What do people think or how do you feel, eh?
Ross, you must follow your heart.
Joey is so sweet.
Hey.
Hey Hey Hey! So, how did you go with Dana? Any reason why I should leave an open time say Thursday?
I could not do it
Could not you do it?
Hey, relax, I just need more time. Let's go to dinner tonight.
What?! You'll go out with her again!
Go out with whom?
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah! Was not she?
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Joey! You did not even know her!
Ah, anything!

Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot friend ?!
Do not touch it!
All right!
All right.
Umm, Wayne is fine, at my level.
All right?
I keep hearing all these rumors that I could be fired.
Ok, they also have actors who come to read for my part!
Come on, buddy, you give me a second chance!
I mean, I love - I love this little guy!
Ha ha !!
Ok, that's why you did not want me to touch it, right?
Here it is!
All right?
Stupid!
I can not believe!
God!
Hey how's it going'?

Hey.
Hello. Look, about what happened before ...
No, hey, well, I-I understand perfectly. You were stressed.
I would have given you the chance to apologize to me.
For what? For allowing me to throw myself out of your office?
You did not have
Yes, well, I'm sorry for the desire to be with my girlfriend for our anniversary, boy, what the hell is me.
But I told you, I did not have the time!
Yes, well, you never have the time. I mean, I do not even feel like having a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Wh, Ross, what do you want from me?
You want me, do you want me to leave my job to make you feel like you have a girlfriend?
I know.
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
What?
But I can not tell you.
Ok, but it would not be easier if you had to tell me something you could tell me.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But no, I promised I would not say it, and I swore to love all my gods.
All right. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
No.
Does it have to do with Joey?
No.
Does it have to do with ... with Chandler and that sock he's holding next to his bed?
No, but let's go back to the next one!

Hello!
Richard!
In fact, I'm not here to complete the chef.
Ohh Oh, all right, I hate when people come back to complete the chef.
As if I had nothing better to do!
So what's up?
Well, it was nice to see you the other night.
Oh, nice to see you too. Did you come here to tell me?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you that I still love you.

A pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be well.
So forcing her to marry Bobby will make it happen?
Could be! Well! Well, so, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can not!
Joey, I'm scared to death for this.
But I really think I can do it, I just need help.
And Bobby will be here all the time.
You bet! And to answer your previous question, we are rap-rapists.
Look, Rachel told me it's so much easier than you did all of this on her. Why can not you do it for me?
Why! Because you are my little sister!
And you are my elder brother!
I mean, you're my favorite boy all over the world.
I'm not even afraid to tell Mom and Dad.
I was afraid to tell you.
Well, I'd be scared of them, but it's okay.
Joey, I can not bear the thought of having this child with you angry with me.
I want you to have your uncle.
Will my child have his uncle Joey?
Of course he will have his uncle Joey!
We'll all be fine. I mean, even if we are not married, this child will be so loved. Not just from us.
Quite right! Even from his uncle!
And you.
Okay, Bobby, why do not we come here and have a little time.
Come here!
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you ?!

I was very good tonight.
Me too. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd like to ask you to come in, but my sister is visiting and I think she sleeps on the couch.
Are you sister? Is your sister asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw
Oh hey, well, you're awake. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Hello!
Nice to meet you. I wish you had told me that we were keeping company, I would settle!
I'd like to help.
You're so bad!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You're so dead! I will get you.
Uh, it was very nice to meet you.

Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something ... something good.
Hi mom, it's Jill.
He's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. My God. I'm trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
Yes I'm fine. I'm just stuck in the bank, in an ATM atrium.
Jill says vestibule ... I'm going with the vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone ... I do not know, a boy.
Oh! Someone. Someone. "Hey, Jill, I saw you with a guy last night

I say, Drew!
Are you seeing someone right now?
Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for myself, I mean No, I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out.
I'm not ... I'm not ... I'm not gay!
Personal shopping? What is that? Do you like where you go around with haughty people and tell them what to buy?
Uh Huh.
Sounds good!
Hey!
Umm, excuse me, we changed apartments. You can not eat more food, that ... the weight train was over.
Is there any sauce?
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people who come all the time.
That fridge needs to be replenished, okay, this is your department now.
What are you doing?
I think I left a donut here.

So, in conclusion, the lines go up all the way, so I'm happy.
Great work team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.
Phil!
Good job.
Stevens!
Well done!
Joel-burg, maniac!
I love you!
Bing!
Good job, I could not have done it without you.
Thank you sir.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my file, by chance.
Of course you did it.
You forgot something else, you're a bastard!
Well what about you?
Do not you feel excluded or something are you?
No. No, absolutely not, it's ridiculous.
Everyone has one and you want one too. It's not true?
Yes Yes Yes!
Now go away from here, you!

Hey, Bob.
Hey! How's my friend Toby doing today?
If I see it, I ask.
Toby!
Hey-hey! Bing? Bob was talking about six? Were you just talking?
Yes!
Oh, then you know each other.
We are based on the name of semi-first name.
What do you think of adding it to our team?
Bob? Ooh, do you work here with us? Everyday? Yes, I do not know if he has what it takes.
Really? They love it down at six.
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard here.

Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
A bizarre date with a hanger for the head?
No. Rachel tied me up with a tuxedo! But not just any tuxedo, Batman's tuxedo!
What?
Quite right! Made specifically for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film where the Batman movie was.
You can not wear it! I'm wearing the famous tuxedo! The James Bond tuxedo!
So?
So, if you wear it, you will make my less special.
Sorry, I do not like the idea of ​​when I say "I do", he's thinking, "Yes, I would do it too!"
Well, then we still have a problem.
Yes!
With what?
Well, we're trying to find someone to celebrate our marriage and they're all boring or annoying or, you know, you can not stop staring at the ladies.
Oo! You should make one of us do it!
Phoebe, we're getting there
No! No! It's ... it's a real thing! Anyone can be ordered on the Internet and perform like weddings and other things!
Are you serious?
Yup! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
I call him!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys, thank you very much, but neither is marrying us.
Calling it no longer means anything ?!
We will have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and master of his saliva!

See, I see .... great passion for your future.
Really?
I want it.
Oh Ross, you're so exceptional. [she playfully scratches her head and gets up]
Never gonna happen.

Everybody knows!
It had to be a good thing, I forgot why.
Listen, Monica, me, you know, okay, you know, I could not sleep for a month, because I got some ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, you, you could have simply knocked over the pillow.
Yes, I would have had if I did not have a big spaghetti on the other side.
What?!?!
Ok, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can shed.
You can pour. In the sink.
Oh, honey, it's not your fault, you know, this is what you are, and I love you, and I want you to be friends, and if I keep living here I do not see that happening.
I love you too.
Aww, good. What?
What? I just said.
No, you're not, you're wondering what pillow it is.

My God! Are you serious?!
Uh Huh.
I'd like to live with you Ross; is fantastic! Thank you!
Well, I'm just glad I can help you, you know, to help you.
Wow! I'm so happy for you guys. This is so, not stupid.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what it means to me!
I mean, I wanted to be homeless.
You just saved me!
You are my hero!
Hero, I do not know ... well, all right.
Oh, I have to go and tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please! Now you will say things, right?
No.
No I will not do it.
But I should tell you, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and said he did not love her, but he did it, and he just blew himself up!
And that's how he ended up living with me!
Ok, this is a lie.

Ugh !!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross's house.
Oh, I missed the count or something.
Damn!
She is no longer there.
Oh, I - I watch, Ross is doing her piece of "Watching TV".
No Joey, I think he's just watching TV.

... Damn, take the girl! Ok, are they all ready?
Uh, listen, I just want to thank you for this great opportunity.
You lose the tunic.
Myself?
Is fantastic.
Well, I'll take another espresso. Can I get you another milk?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's all?
Yes, it was really difficult.
Oh yes, that embrace seemed rather brutal.
Ok, you were not there.

Wow! It's ah, it's cute!
Very nice?
You'll have to forgive my roommate, he wanted to marry him.
We do not have 50 dollars, but would you be willing to negotiate for this? We have a canoe.
You know, I really do not think we need a canoe.
You must take a canoe!
All right, just take the entertainment center and then when you get home, throw away the canoe!
We do not throw it away! I built that canoe!
Good for you!!

Phoebe?
Yes?
All right. So I guess it's just, wait here then. Hello. I need a fake ticket in Yemen.
A ticket for Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just need a ticket for the fake.
I'm sorry, sir, I do not understand.
What would you give to a child if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Are you traveling with a child?
No.
All right, you know what, he'll think I'm giving you a credit card, but what I really do is give you a library card.
Ah, sir, a ticket to Yemen costs $ 2,100 and we do not take the library cards.
What's up? Something wrong? Do you have to stay?

Ok, but this is the last time.
With a chick here, and a chick there.
Here a girl, a girl, a chick everywhere - chickeeeen.
Hey.
Hey.
How are you?
She?
Well, yes, do not ... do not you think it's her?
I do not know. I can not say, but never came back too soon.
Well, anyway, I have to go change, I'm ah, I meet some of the cast for drinks.
I'm sorry?
What?
Ok, fine, so here you go. Go with Vince.
Yes, but Jason is very sensitive.
Well sensitive is important, choose him.
Yes.
Oh sure, go with the girl.
Jason is not a girl!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.

Hello.
So, apparently people are familiar with the history of Europe?
Yes.
Listen to it, the whole, which has come to those who really do not care.
I mean, I think it would have happened either way.
I mean if I had not started it-I-I know I would have.
It was a fantastic night.
Was. It was a fantastic night.
Do you think it was fantastic?
Do we still have a name?
No not yet.
All right, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Hello Baby.

Ah-ah, nowhere to run!
I do not like sitting here! I'm about to finish
No Rachel! They arrived here first!
Why is Ross doing it?
DANGER
My God! Because he's jumping on those women!
No, it's okay. Do not worry about this
Oh, look! It will leave a stain!
Rachel! Hey! All right! You're from Joey!
Really?
Yes! Look!
I've never lived like this before.
I know.
All right, do not waste it, I mean its still food.

Hi Joey, is this the bed Olivia has lost her virginity?
I do not know, but one of the extras certainly did! Hey, listen to Rach. Thanks again for coming to see my scenes!
Oh, please, honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I am ... OH MY GOD! Is it Christian Sanders?
Even so
Oh, in my head he did some nice "non-gay" stuff!
Well, at Christmas he and Santa have done things that are definitely gay!
OK, you have to promise that you will never tell Ross what I told you.
About what?
He's organizing your birthday party.
My God! I love!
You'd better behave surprised.
About what?
My surprise party!
What a surprise party?
Oh finish it. Joey already told me.
Well, he did not tell me.
Hey, do not look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical I'm always the last to know everything.
No you are not. We tell you stuff.
Yuh-huh!
I was the last to know when Chandler was bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
I was the last to know when you had a crush on Joey when he moved.
It seems to be the penultimate.

Chandler, we have not yet got an RSVP from your father.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe because I did not send him an invitation.
Chandler! He is your father; it should be at the wedding.
I do not even know the man. All right? We are not so close. I have not seen it for years.
Well, what will you do when you find out that you have not even been asked ?!
Well, you do not have to know!
It is not that we run in the same environments.
I'm going with you guys, and he's the star of a drag show in Las Vegas.
Ooh, I think I want to exchange circles.
Trust me, you do not want it there either.
All right?
Nobody will be staring at the bride when the groom's father wears a strapless dress.
So! I do not care as long as you do not wear a white dress and a veil.
Ok, I think I need to do some shopping.

Hello! Who's inside?
How are you'?
Who the hell are you?
I guess you would not believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, eh?
No-no, Rachel, I do not understand! He can not see us!
No Yes! The groom can not see the bride!
I will not marry Chandler!
Not after this!
Ok, guys, relax. I doooo.
I have to go.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yes, well, you should do it.

Sorry, I'm late, but I left late.
All right.
So Phoebe, what is the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well, yes, but then I remembered I started it and there was this rally and I was, I was at the top of the pyramid but anyway ... um, what is this book about?
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
You know what, actually Ok, okay, what's so funny here?
I thought you did not smoke.
Oh, I thought you meant marijuana cigarettes, you know?
You know what I mean, like the dubbies?
And actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
But no, I actually smoke all the normal ones, all the time.
We stand up.
Oh me too.
I'm kidding.
Oh me too.

Oh, are you sure you're okay?
Yes.
Still it hurts?
Yes.
What a nice idea. All your clothes match. I will do it.
Hello.
Hey how you doing?
Excellent.
We shared that couple and we kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine anyway.
You know what? You are right. I
Good for you Phoebe!
Ok.
Okay, if you have microphones too, I did not mean it

This sucks! I did not know I had to stay up all night before going to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
It's 6:00 am.
Yes good
Hello!
Hey, I heard you and Joshua are going out for dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think it is, I think it's really strong.
Yes, Rachel, I think you're handling it really well.
It run?
What do you mean to manage it?
There is nothing to manage.
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it were not for me and Joshua.
You know, they will not marry anyway!
What?
Come on!
They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous!
I mean, will they be engaged for what?
One year?
And somewhere along the way, one of them will realize what they have done and will call it all.
I'm telling you that you'll dance at my wedding before you dance.
What the hell is this ?!
What, did you really think it would make me feel better to give me things that I can not use for another two months?
This sucks!
All right, what's my next gift?
!

All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
I have boxes.
Hey guys! Watch this! Check this baby, dig it!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole !!
Ow !! Ow !!!
What?! What?!! What is that?!
I'm drinking?
Oh, I must have said that after you left.
Said what? Exactly.
Whether you like the occasional binge of drinks.
My God!! Ohh, that's it! I'm leaving! You're just a horrible person!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait !!
If you become sensitive about it!
I do not want to lose you.
What happens if I create a position for you?
I will make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.
You can have your office and an increase! Effective tomorrow.
I need an expense account.
Done!
And an assistant.
Sophie, come in here!

Monica? You will be very proud of me. I just made an appointment with two incredibly cute nurses.
Oh my!
I am a male nurse.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I do not think so
What?
What are you talking about?!
You, you're the one telling me to get past Ross and move on.
I'm moving forward and you go forward with me.
Come on, give me a good reason why you do not want to go.
Umm, why do not you?
What?
More difficult than it seems. It's not true?
Okay, come with me, and I've also told them that if we're still here when they come down, we'll go to the cafeteria and see
Yup! There is always space for
Joey, how are you?
Oh, it's easy. Yes, I - I can do it with anything. Watch grandma's chicken salad

Hi, this is Monica ...
Yes???
Oh...
Ok, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right at the bottom.
Thank you.

All right. Let's bring it inside
Wait no, honey, honey, give it to me, throw it to me.
Here it is.
He almost hit me in the face.
A stripper at a bachelor party, is so cliche. Why do not you take a magician ?!
Well, if the wizard can open my beer with his cheeks, then fine.

Hey!
Hey!
You know, I'm really glad I decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy, me too!
You know, I was thinking if we had a big fight and we broke up for a few hours
Yes?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, overbearing and overbearing ?!
The marriage is off, sloppy and immature!
It's me! Come on!
All right. But wait, we can not. My cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we should have lunch.
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Stride ?! The wedding is back!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hello! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you.
So, are you ready to go?
Yes.
Chandler!
I'll be fine with you.

Th-th-this is all that is, a third nipple.
You know?
Only the third nipple run-of-the-mill.
You know?
You can take it off.
Just cut that baby right away!
Take off your shirt and see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
I'm just showing you my third nipple run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off.
Well, this is not a third nipple.
No?
First of all, it's in your ass.
Well, then what is it ?!
Wait a minute, keep it. Johnson! Will you come here a moment?
I'm with Hamilton!
He's good at things on the back, he's wearing it too.

Umm, this is a great wine.
It comes from France in Western Europe of Europe. You know, a few years ago I was really backpacking all over Western Europe.
Really?
Uh-hmm-Wait! Improve Uhm, yes, I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
Anyway, um, I was um, I was hiking
I love hiking!
Oh that's great! I was walking along the slopes of Mount Tibidaybo
I see!
So? Congratulations, you two, I did not even know you were married.
Oh, we ... we did not.
No, no. We
What?!
Um, we're ... we're just doing this kid together, but that's all.
Why?!!
Uh well, we're not alone in that place, you know? But we are very enthusiastic about this.
Oh. Well, then you shush me.
Just tell me how
Uh-oh, I hear another coming.
Sid, you're a lucky dull bastard.

Forget it, Ross.
Yeah, well, you did not know Chi Chi.
Promise everyone?
Yes! We promise! We will be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can enter, but your little friend with the tip of the filter must stay out!
Hey, Phoebe.
"Dear Madam, Buffay.
Thank you for calling attention to our mistake.
We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
We apologize for the inconvenience and I hope you accept this -
Bye Bye.
Yup?
What are you doing'?
Ooh.

Oh my God, honey, we're so destined to be together. We both have copies of the
Honey, both of you.
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Yes? The problem of work?
Oh, it was perfect! I mean, it really felt like I was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him you had?
Oh it's not important. The point is that, really, I think everything will be fine.

Ok, I have some, do you want to put them in her panties?
No thanks, mom!
Oh, no umm, hi, that ... you have to put it out because I'm pregnant.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Very good, so good.
I really liked it. Very exotic
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua did not call.
I mean, you'd think he'd be worried about me not coming to his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Come on! Look where you are !!
When you get a second, another round of daiquiri.
Remember, virgin for me, please.
Oh! And do not let me go without having the name of that kind of carpet.
Ahh, let's go! You know what, you know what, I think I'll come home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help you.
No!
It was a test!
In a couple of hours I'll be really drunk and I want to call Kathy and you guys will have to stop me!
And then later, I'll be so drunk, I want to call Janice
You should! Like her?
Ohhh !!
I think someone needs another lap dance.

All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
You do?
You do not do it? Well, this is the difference between a professional and a lay person.
That and arrogance.
Hey.
Hey! How was the navigation?
Wow thanks!
Joe?
Yes!
You had a lot of sex, right?
When? Today? Some, not much.
Well, that's just why I'm asking, because in a sense, eh, I was not able to ... I mean I really wanted, but I could not.
There, huh-hmm, there was an accident.
Do not worry about that man, it happens.
Did it happen to you?
Yes! One time.
Well, what did you do?
I did the same.

'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Take what you want, just please do not hurt me.
So you're playing a little
Yes, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 is the most stupid that a person can watch, you're definitely 19 years old.
Come on man, how old are you?
Young! Are you a man-child ok ?! Now go and get changed because everyone is ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
And did they know?
Ok, well, Ross, what is it really about?
Look, this is my house and I want to be able to come and go when I want!
Ok, I'll find another place to do the rest of my dates. I do not know what the big problem is!
The big problem is that I do not want naked and greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to throw myself back with a beer puzzle! Cold beer.

Okay, look, it will not hurt him, will you?
Do you always have to bring it here?
I did not want to leave it alone.
Alright?
We had our first meeting this morning.
I think it has to do with my work until late.
I said some things I did not mean, and he ... threw some feces ...
You know, if you'll work late, I could take a look at you for you.
Oh, it would be great!
Ok, but if you do, make sure you're there to see it, okay, and you're not like it for me.
Ok, but if you ask me, I'm not going to lie.

All right, take a look.
Check it.
Here it says that there is a place where you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
"It's almost as good as being there."
It's better! You can not go to a museum in your underwear!
Oh-oh! I bet the English version is gooooood!

Uh, can I help you?
Yes, I spoke to you on the phone, I'm the lady who got stuck with the racing bed.
Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed up for this, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester, look, we want to see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Hey! You can not go back there!
My God.

So, this must be nice enough for you, eh?
I mean, your father tells me you have a couple of days at school, and you, you, do not have to sell those cookies anymore.
Well, I wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp and sits in a
Wow, you ah, you really like all this stuff, huh?
Yes.
My father says that if I spend so much time helping him clean apartments, while daydreaming outside space, he could afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think you should clean a lot of apartments to go to India.
No. The one from Atlantic City, dad, loves slots. He says he will double the college money my grandmother left me.
Oh, um, I do not know if it's a good idea.
Oh. Look, just friends, I will not afflict you. I promise.
No, I just think it's too early.
No, it's not too early, I had lunch at eleven.

I invented the game of Cups as a way to give money to Joey.
And now you want that money back.
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me?
It is not a real game! I invented it!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
I do not know.
But I can see through your sheet.
Yes, yes, it's her.
But you know what?
It does not matter, I will never be able to meet her anyway.
Why?
Because it is impossible to find his apartment! He lives in a parallel universe similar to a sexy girl, or something like that.
What are you talking about? Obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. He lives on
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby.
And you know the other over there, that's the ladder.
You were wrong.
I did it

Monica, I bet the apartment, I do not know.
Rachel, I have not lost a question for the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Do you have the answers written there?
No! Stable like a rock! Now, you're with me.
All right, let's do it.
Come on!
All right.
All right, gentlemen, you're the first.
All right.
All right.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning starts - stop it - now. What was Monica's nickname when he was a field hockey goalie?
Great fat goalkeeper.
Correct. It supports Rachel
dangerous relationships
Correct. His favorite movie is ...
Weekend at Bernie's
Well, look, because not really, because you're not part of our phase two strip club with us.
Yes, come on, we can be boys!
No you can not.
Come on! We try to be guys! Maybe we want to be boys!
You do not want to be boys, you'd be all hairy and I will not live longer.
You know, you just stopped being so good and you let it go and you come with us to watch the naked girls dancing around !!
All right.
I'm sorry.

And you know what, I just realized, in the last year I only came out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
You have to help me here, you have to settle down, you have to get back into the game.
Well, that should not be a problem. I mean, I work in fashion and all those I meet are suitable heterosexual men.
Pete, can I bring you something else?
Yes, a slice of cheesecake and ... and a date if you gave them away.
Did not we discuss this topic with you and you?
Hmm, come on, you just told her that you.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blonde wig and big tits and the fact that I need you to eat.
Well, if it's true, I'll go out with my aunt Ruth.
And the two times we left were simply embarrassing.
Come on, you think he should go out with me, right?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
I mean it's not a nice picture in the morning, you know what I mean.
That wig all in disarray, and the tits thrown on the bedside table, you know.
I mean, really, think about it.
Ho-ho, I will do it.

I think I read it somewhere!
This is not fun, it's physically impossible!
Ok?
Depending on the species I should have a length of six feet ...
It's not funny!
!
I respectfully disagree.
I can not believe you put it on my student page!
Who cares? Nobody reads these things
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
I do not have a page.
Oh oh oh! I REPLY IN AVAILABLE MODE !!

I know you miss me too. I can not wait to see you. I love you. Hello.
Ok, what's here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I really miss this apartment. You know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right there.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I came across this and it kind of kicked me out a bit?
I love this place! To tell you the truth, I would not have to move.
Uhh, are you saying you're not completely happy with this?
Well, I mean if, if Emily gave me a choice
you
Why?
Hey guys! See what I found in the giiiiiiift store. Get up! Get up! Get up!

I let a bra dry on the shower, do not you think your child will think it's yours and be horribly traumatized?
Hey, if mom can have a wife, dad can have a bra.
Oh, it's time to go.
Oh, no-no-no, you see, that-that clock is a bit quick, uh, we have 17 minutes.
Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
Twice?
Well, it's ambitious.
Hey, you can ignore it.
It's Carol with your son!
The morning is here! The sun is here! The sky is clear, the morning is here! The morning is here!
HEY !! do
Oh come on! The morning is here! The morning is here! The morning is here! The sun is here!
I
Are you kidding? I love that guy! The morning is here! The morning is here-
Stop that! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Do what I did.
Monica, you do not even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
You know what? I'm
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
All right.
See, this is a
Shut up! This place is a hole!

Well, buddy, it's time to roll.
Ninth!
No, no-n-n-n-no !!
You're going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic and a pajama store!

Are you under the sheet?
Yup.
Great, let's start. How's the pressure?
Beautiful! Wow Phoebe you're good!
Declaring the obvious, but thanks. And it's not strange it is.
No. Ooohh
It's right, you enjoy yourself.
Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
All right.
Oh God Phoebe !! Oh that's all! That's all! Right here! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh

Hello!
Oh, Alice, bye!
Thank you.
I'm so happy you can come, because I have a real domestic emergency.
Oh my God, who died on this ?!
Yes I know. It is a real mustard-tastrofo. You can help me?
Become a theater critic!
I am hurt! A plague on both your houses!
By the way, he downloaded me tonight after reading my review.
Oh, elegant.
Yup! Surely I know how to choose them, eh? You know, I gave up a part for a soap for this!
Wow! Yes, ah, I gave up a job too.
Really. What?
Uh, de-clawed cats.
Hey, tell me what.
Let me take you home.
We will stop at all newsstands and we will burn every copy of their Times and Post.
Why the Post?
Oh, did not you see the Post?
Not you?
No because?

Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Uhh, well, I have an audition down the street and I poured sauce everywhere on my shirt. Do you have one more?
Yes sure. Umm here.
Great. You have something that is not
Yes, I do not think about Joe.
All right, I guess everything will be fine.
Hey, listen, what are you doing tonight?
Nothing Why?
How would you feel to remove my Tag assistant? I'll pay.
Huh, Rach, I have to say they'll make a lot of money to go out with a guy.
I'm not asking you to go on one
Really? Because I could use the money.
Joey, just ... he's new to town and I know he has no friends.
Just bring it to a ball game or something.
I really appreciate it.
Yes, OK.
Yes?
Sure no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Yes!
All right.

Smell of problem in the litter? Do not change your kitten, change your cat's waste.
Sorry, Phoebe.
Yes. Are you okay?
No! Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Hello!
Hello. Well, look, I was going to leave a message, is not it tonight, your anniversary dinner?
Yes. Well, umm .....
Rachel, are you okay?
Yes I'm fine.
Do you want to talk, I mean I can come?
No! Really, no, please, please, everything is ok.
All right, all right, I'm coming and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Oh yes, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
And for me.
Oh. OK Bye.

Come on, take it, get it!
Hello?
Transit authority?
Yes, bye.
I'm researching a book and wondering what anyone could do if they left a child on a city bus.
Yes, I realize that it would be a very stupid character.
Hi, here's the deal.
Today we lost a seat on a bus.
It is made of white plastic, with a handle and fits into a stroller.
Oh, and there was a baby inside.
He wants to talk to you again.

Hello.
I'm sorry, I'm a little late.
Ah - Whoa!
Very late.
Let me begin uh, introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.
So, to sum up, I'm Professor Geller.
Good work today

Good evening ladies.
My name is Ross Geller.
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.
And I - I realize that the competition is fierce but - I'm sorry.
I can not help but notice that you are naked and I applaud you.
Friend, I would like to be naked.
I mean, this ... looks so beautiful.
Here's how God meant it.

Ok, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during all our friendship!
But when we were in high school I made friends with James Farrell even when I knew you liked it!
Wow, I feel so good to take off my chest!
OK Go!
My turn? What are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
What?!
I heard someone on the phone the other day and you said, "I'll tell Rachel that I've been doing laundry for a couple of hours."
And he said, "Laundry?
IS
Well. It looks like you're writing a little music, Rach. Wow! Let me know how it turns out.
Well, I do not know why I got so out of my mind that I hung up the phone.
Well, if you kept listening, you'd have heard it called Mr. Big ot.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He says more
All right. So you're telling me there's nothing between you and Chandler.
Chandler and me?

I really thought you were making a good point. I mean, you know, until you've cut yourself out.
Yes, what's up with that girl, Monica?
I do not know! I did not come with her!
All right! All guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
A test?!!
Come on! The tests make us all better students! Oh yeah! We should have questions about the essay !!

Ok, I have one for you, if you also had what you'd rather eat, a dog to see or a talking gorilla?
I should say the talking gorilla, because at least I can tell him that you're making me eat from him.
Someone went to college. Wow. What is that? I'm sorry.
Ok, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay still.
I think it's better, sir.
But we really need to find someone here.
Work is beginning to accumulate.
I have a stack of documents on my desk so high.
You know what you should do, throw them into the shedder and claim you never saw them.
That's a good one.
What a boy must do

Yes, yes, they are all here. Hey, everyone, say hello to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi, Julie!
There is no national football league.
Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sunday and Monday nights.
Oh, shoot! I work Monday evening.
Umm, this stuffing is incredible. Do you think we should bring some?
When they are hungry enough, they will enter.

Hey, Joey, did you want to talk to me?
I do not know. You have something for me?
Oh yes, this is from Rachel.
Ten. All right. Now Tag is something like too many women.
Really?
Yes for you!

Oh, Danielle! I did not expect the car ... Call me when you get a chance. Bye Bye. Oh God!
That is
Hey, I'm perfecting!
What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh ..
I want you to think I could be in a restaurant ... you know?
I could have some kind of life, as if I had not sat here to refine the last few hours.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
My God! Go away! Stop looking here!
Fantastic, now he's coming back.
Friend, we have to do something for that boy.
This morning, I surprised him while he was looking in our apartment.
It creeps me out!
I feel like I can not do things!
What kind of stuff?
You grow up? I'm not talking about sexy things, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Do you cook naked?
Yes, toast, oatmeal ... nothing but splashes.
What are you watching me for? I did not know.

You know, they say that a dish seen never emits beeps.
It's only a couple of hours, and she did not call. Not that I'm even interested, you know.
Phoebe, why do not you call her? Obviously you want it.
You think you know me so well.
Well, I do not want Cha?
Yes.
Ok, well, I know you.
That's what I said.
Well?
I can not
I can not
He downloaded me, I mean, I totally trusted her and then one day it was "Okay, bye Pheebs".
You know what's the saddest part, when we were playing together, it was the funniest I've ever had in all my life.

OK Bye. Well, Monica will not come, it's just me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, wait for the camper, are you sure you thought about this?
It's a laundry. The way of thinking is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on an appointment.
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
So what are you saying here? Should I shave again, get some wine, what?
Well, you might want to rethink the dirty laundry.
This is basically the first time you'll see your underwear, do you want it to be dirty?
No.
Oh, um, the softener?
Ok, ok, now what's wrong with mine
Here it is.

Ok, so it's just because it was my table, do I have to buy a new one?
This is the rule.
Which rule? There is no rule, if nothing else, you owe me a table!
How did you get there?
Well, I think the furniture went well up to your little breakfast with Angela Delvecchio
Did you know that?
Well, let's say that the impressions you've made in butter have left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, and if we split it?
What do you mean, buy it together?
Yes
Do you think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
Well, it's a rather big effort, I mean, and if one of us wants to move?
Why, are you transferring?
I will not move.
You would tell me if you were going to the right
Yes, yes, it's just the one with my last Kip roommate ...
Aw, I know everything about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran away and got married, and things went very badly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a roommate better than me?
Aw, do not do it

Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have an appointment for a massage.
Oh no, stay here we will continue to do it. I will pay you
No, I got in trouble for the first one. See you later.
Absolutely. I love your way of kissing.
My God! My God! I'm so sorry!
I forget, it's from
Do you think you can tear my daughter apart and then do not marry her ?! I will kill you!!
You know, it's really not a great time for me.

All right! So we will simply be married.
Yes exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Wow! This is so surprising. I really thought I had to involve you more in this.
Ok, see, now I'm scared because I do not really think you're joking.
I'm not joking. Look, I - I can not have
What ... what will we stay married forever?
Ok, look, how will it affect you?
Really?
I mean that you fill out some form once in a while and instead of checking the box that says you're checking the box that says Mrs.!
His
Oh, ok, I'm sorry.
You are right.
You know what?
We can absolutely stay married, because I had the impression that the boxes were far away
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!
And like my wife, I think you should give me this favor.

My God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
I think I should have known when he started going to the dentist four and five times a week.
I mean, how can your teeth be cleaned?
My brother is going through it right now, it's such a mess. How did you overcome it?
Well, you could try to accidentally break something precious, let's say she-
-leg?
This is a way! Me, I- I went to watch.
Did you really break his watch?
Ooh, stay away from you.
Quite right.
Barry, I'm sorry ...
I'm so sorry...
I know you probably think this is all I said the other day about you making love with your socks, but it's not ... it's not, it's about me, and me, hi, car-cutting me away again ... anyway ...

No, true, honey, it's okay, just go with Susan.
Really, I, no, I think the girls that come out is a great idea.
Ok, ok, bye
So what are they doing?
I do not know, something feminine.
Hey, you're early.
What are you doing with the lamp?
I'm just recovering it.
Oh, well, do not take it to the same place you got the stereo, because they've had that thing for over a week.
No, no, Mr. Heckles no one makes noise here.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
You do not play the oboe!
I could play the oboe!
Ohhh! It's so sweet!
Okay, okay, I know I'm a Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's so hard, I mean to see you go around and I just want to touch you and hold you back, come on nobody around, just kiss me.
All right, that's it! Come down to her!
What is going on?
What is going on?! Here's what's happening !!
Ross!
I've been in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
What should I do to get a service?
Hi Rachele.

Ross?
Yes?
Hey, it's Mona! From the wedding
Oh hello!
Hello!
Wow! How are you?
I'm fine except, you still owe me a dance.
Oh this is true. Well, would you like to see a Ukrainian film?
Oh you are serious. Sure!
Great! Good, umm
I think I might need another cup of coffee.
Sure! Uh, let me take it for you.
All right.

Look, I feel really bad about how I scared you before, so I called my father and asked him to meet you here to say so.
Leave!
What? Hey, wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you know who the father is?
Sometimes I play crazy, but I'm a little more than a pretty blonde girl with an ass that will not stop.
I believe this belongs to your child's father.
Oh God Oh, is he in there right now?
Uh Huh. Now you can turn around or you can enter and tear the Band-Aid. What do you want to do?
Uh, let's tear!
Really? Are you sure?
Oh Phoebe!
Ok, sorry. Yes.
Hey, Rachel.

Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Oh, you're so wonderful.
Why do not you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
I can not believe you guys bought it, enjoy your slow death.
I think there are people who have sex.
It can not be me, I'm right here.
Do you want to peek?
No!
Come on!
You know what? I do not like you, without mom. Come on.
Are not we peeking?
Well, I'm peeking. My God!
Hi sir, you know Monica.

Chandler is fantastic !!
What?!
Oh God, we just clicked!
Do you know how people can click?
As if he had come to get me, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click!
Did he tell you?
Oh, I ...
Oh, and he has such a good heart! Does not have a good heart?
Oh I know ...
Oh, I know and it's so sweet! Listen, he said he would call, then let it go.
Is not it fantastic ?!
Do not ruin it.

Hello.
Hi sweetie!
Hello.
Hi, Ross.
Yes, eh.
I have bad news.
What?
I can have a quick bite, but then I have to come back here.
Come on baby! You've had to work late every night for the last two weeks, what's this time?
In fact, it's my fault. I-I go out today.
But work comes first of all! Oh, hey, but this is sad for you, though, what happened? Burnt? It burns everything, does not it?
Nooo, he's going for a better job.
Oh well, it's great, so I guess this is ah, this is goodbye then. Eh? Goodbye.
OK then.
All right.
Well, we'll miss you around here.
Yes me too.
So, I'll see you on Saturday.
Yes, you can bet on it.

Whazzup ??
Seriously a friend, 3 years ago.
Listen, can you do me a favor?
Today I'll be out.
Can you keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Do not you trust him?

I think the check-in is like this.
Ahh.
Monica confronts her, Chandler is against marriage. And it will always be!
Well, there are some people who want to marry me.
There are?
Yes! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you ?! And ... and Chandler is telling you how much he hates marriage ?!
Quite right.
grocer
You just told me he hates marriage!
That ... that's a ... a complex guy who will hardly take a wife!
That - which is against marriage and always will be!
You have

You know you probably did not know, but back in high school, I had a big crush on you.
I knew it.
You did it! Oh ... I always thought you just thought I was Monica's brilliant older brother.
I did it.
Oh.
Listen, you think ... and try not to let my intense vulnerability become some kind of factor here, but do you think it would be ok if I asked you out?
Sometimes?
Could be?
Yes, maybe...
Ok ... okay, maybe I will ...

Why?
Well, I thought it would make me feel good doing something nice for my friend.
Well, you're incredible.
Oh no-no-no.
A TV as if it appeared from nowhere! This is the dream! Friend, how could you afford this stuff?
Well, you know, I'm 29 years old. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you're the best friend anyone has ever had.
Oh I do not know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are!
You do this, you give me the good advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on a woman, I'll do it.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I'll see how things go with Kathy. She's very pretty.
O Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
It could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
You know what I think?
I think someone has a crush on Casey.
How can I fix you?
What do you think?
That all the pieces of my life are falling into place!

Hey, did someone take a piece of rope about six feet long with a little fuck at the end?
Honey, what's the problem?
I just saw Janice.
Because every time I see your face, I can not help but fall from grace. I know.....
Wow! This girl is good
Oh-yes, yes! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of it before.
I like her.
Why? Why can she sing and play guitar and do both at once?
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for these people.
Look at yourself. All jealous.
Yes, Phoebe, come on, you two have completely different styles. You know, she's more ... you know, and you're more
next to meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Ok, see, see, everyone else is happy that she's finished.
Ok, my next song is called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say.
I really loved when we were singing partners, and I should not have left you like that.
Oh no, one of those "look for the hidden meaning" of the songs.

Yes, bye.
I have a question.
Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Thank you.
No,
What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
Okay, look ... look, let's go downstairs, we'll have a little fun and you'll forget about everything.
Ross, no! There is
Oh come on! Rach, it's not that bad.
Ross, I'm a human doodle !!
Look, just because an idiot has drawn you on your face does not mean you should not have fun!
All right?
And then, hey-hey-hey, nobody will
Ok, there was

Come on!
Oh wait, do not you have to pay for yours, ladies prospering?
No, it's okay. A few guys asked me to take it for him, but I did not
Oh yeah? All right.
All right.
But! Do not you have to return your money?
Uh Huh. Hey, here you go friend. Sorry, no porn for you. Ok, let's go see Monica!

My God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, do you want to come for a lemonade?
So?!
Whoa, ah !! Will you give us some lemonade?
Yes huh !! Cover yourself!
Oh, right.
I do not believe it! When someone asks you for lemonade and does it mean that they want to have sex?
Well usually ... yes!
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, just, I thought you liked me.
I'm such an idiot.
All right. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not someone I know, but ... By the way, I can still see it.

Hmmm ... this is so beautiful.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question like ... more than a general wonder ... ment.
OK.
OK. Here it is. For a while now, I wanted, um ....
Ohhh !!!!
Yes it's true ...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ouch!
Well, I probably would have done it at some point.
I did not mean
Why not?
It's brilliant!
Hi Mike, see you at the wedding, buddy!
Well, we probably will not invite you to the wedding ...
Thanks, Chandler.
Sincerely.
Well, you're welcome! I'm glad to help you.
How do you think I should propose?
David, I'm pretending to do it

Ok, you still have 19 questions to ask. Use them wisely. Come on, Joey! You can not win if you do not ask
What?!
Well, you promised me a fun trip!
We've been on the road for six hours and you've slept for half past five!
We are moving to the next rest stop and
All right. All right.
Yes! And until then you'll sing me because the radio is broken and you're selfish but you have a good voice.
Really? I do not
To sing!!
Friend, this is a long journey! Are my eyes open? No!
Morning!

Everything was delicious!
Thank you!
Was. The duck in particular was superb.
Thank you! You did not say anything ...
In fact I have a small complaint.
Oh ... please! I-I welcome criticism.
The musician right outside the restaurant ... he's kind of a killer of mood!
Which musician?

Did we do it?
You owe me $ 20.
Thank you. Thanks a lot!
Chandler, here you go, you have your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese dishes and your Funyun family bag.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you have for Thanksgiving dinner?
What, what, what is with you and this holiday?
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
We've just finished this wonderful Thanksgiving dinner.
I - and I vividly remember this part - a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is when my parents choose to tell me they are about to get divorced.
My God.
Yes. It is very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner after seeing it otherwise.

Hey, who is this little boy naked?
That little naked boy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yes, yes, well, this is my penis. Can we be adults now?
Who are those people?
You got me
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Joe and Joe's band'.
Wow, Monica, you look like your grandmother. How old was she?
Let's see, 1939 ... yes, 24, 25?
It looks like a funny gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I took Monica naked!
Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, I'm just trying something.

So, what is it?
Rachel has something she wants to tell you and me, I think this is your red sweater.
No. This is my red sweater.
Oh no, could I have someone with a coffee or a poison? No? Just for me? All right.
What's happening, Rach?
Anything! Phoebe made a mistake. But you know you wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of challenge?
You know, I'm really happy that Phoebe called.
I know we broke up because you thought I was not mature enough, but I really grew up and I think we should get back together.
Oh, it's not the right time.
It's the right time
All right.
'Kay!

Odd thing I heard - Mother of God is true!
Chandler Bing!
Jan-Janice!
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contract and everything.
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide basin. You remember Chandler.
Janice, I did not even know you were pregnant! Who is the unaware human who is the essence that you stole?
It is you. This is yours.
What?!
See how nervous he feels! We have not slept together for years!
It is funny. It hurts? Does the job hurt?

Friend, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking about dinner ?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
You know, you know I'm watching and I do not think anyone is home here.
I say just break the window, crawl, and - and I can explain later.
Yes? Really? Nobody is home?
I do not think so Hello? When you arrive there

Hi how are you?
I just saw Danny go on the subway with a girl and he held her arm.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, it's all your fault! You have meddled in our relationship !!
You have not had any relationships !!
No, but I was doing my things and everything was going according to plan!
Oh God, stop with the plan!
So what, so what did you see with a girl?
Who cares?!
This does not mean anything!
Now look, you'll go out for an appointment with Danny and you'll be so charming that he'll forget all about that stupid subway girl.
It was rather stupid.
You are right.
All right, I'll go to the appointment.
I'm going to the appointment.
This is the new plan.
Come, hurry up!

Hello.
Phoebe!
Ta-da.
Hey.
Hello.

I? Thanks you too.
Thank you.
Sparkling.
So, wow, this is really wonderful, eh.
Mr. Major capade guy.
I remember when you were alone, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
You always said I could make it.
Yeah, well, you know, I'm a little spooky this way. Wooo.
I missed you. I will be changed.
OK.
Um, now. Phoebe.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
What?
Er, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.

Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers, I can not wait for your party to come tonight.
Listen, I forgot your address, can you call me?
Thanks bye.
Hey!
Hey!
What is going on'?
Yes, it's a pity that you can not get to that show for a woman tonight.
Oh, I'd like to, but I have to get up early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
Oh yes, yes, yes ...
"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers who can not wait for your party tonight"
Stupid Jane Rogers !!
Are you celebrating tonight ??
I have a ... something for the days of the people in our lives.
And you were not going to tell us? How did you think to get away with it?
I do it every year
Do you do it every year ??
I did not have to tell you !! I'm more stupid than Jane Rogers !!
Oh, that's why you got these tickets for that performance, to get rid of us?
Yes...
And last year is why you sent us to that medieval restaurant?
Yes...
OH! And the year before, when did you set that night tour of that button factory?

Who is this from?
Oh, that's Ross.
Oh ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Remember what?
It was like months ago.
We were walking in this antique shop, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like my grandmother when I was a child.
Oh!
I can not believe he remembered!
Oh, it's so cute. This must cost him a fortune.
I can not believe he did it.
Come on, Ross? Do you remember when I went to college when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
F-hah .... flennin ....
My God.

I really like waking up with you.
I like to wake up with you too. Oh! It's a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
It would be great!
We could have breakfast in bed
Wait, just a second.
All right. Oh! Oh no

Well, it was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids
Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Hello!
Is this Bonnie? Is this Bonnie? Are you Bonnie?
Can I show you a document if you wish?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you're very different from the last time I saw you.
Oh yes, I just started wearing the bras again.
Oh, it must be like that.
Well, I hope you enjoy tonight.
Thank you! You too.
I believe it.
No, you do not.
Sure.
No, you know, you know, you will not let me suck on this.
Oh sure I am, because you must always be right.
I do not always have to be-okay, okay
Jurassic Park

I'm telling you, something is wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the garbage chute.
Ross could not adapt to the garbage chute.
Exactly, he could almost. It's exactly like I stuck there.
Hey!
There he is!
My God! Where the hell have you been? !!
Alone, you know.
Oh, out, oh God, I do not know why we did not think to check there!
What were you doing?
I went to a bar. And then I just, uh, I walked for a while.
Have you walked all night in the city alone?
He connected! He connected with someone.
Look, I do not have to answer your questions! All right? I'm a big boy, I can do anything I want!
He hooked !! Tell us about her!
Ross, you left your scarf in Hey you guys.

All right.
Oh yes, it looks good.
Guys, do a
Yes, we're fine together.
Yes, we
All right.
Wow! Imagine what our children would be like!
You know, we do not have to imagine it.
The groom.
We'll see.

Hey! Hey! Pay attention to my Porsche!
Hi Joey.
Hey! How are you'?
It has the most incredible Porsche down there!
I'd like to show you, but I just put it inside.
She is sleeping.
Hey, would you like two girls to have a drink?

Well, the old lady is dead.
And how do I know?
His dying wish was for one last kiss.
But I do not care, because you have the apartment.
Yup!
Ewww. Yes. Umm. I think I'll stay here.
Is not it fantastic?
Ezels !!

Smelly cat, stinky cat, what do they feed you? Smelly cat, stinking cat, it's not your fault.
Wow is fantastic.
Oh yeah!
You know, you could absolutely sell it. It would be perfect for how umm, a cat litter campaign.
I ..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
What? Why not? You could make a lot of money.
Okay, well, if I were in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire now, you know.
You just have to get out of that sweet jewel.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
All right. All right, I'll play a song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.

Ok sir, um-mm, let's see if I understand correctly.
Ah, so this is a half-caf, double high, nutty easy, not fat, no foam, with whisk, extra hot milk, right?
Ok, fantastic.
You're a maniac.
Thank you.
Um, coffee, please.
Isabella Rosselini.
Are you serious? My God.
Damn! I can not believe I took it off my list.
Why? Why else would you do it?
Yes, maybe.
Oh-oh, minds.
What do not you think I could go to her?
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit that you liked me.
Yes, well, miss, you'd better be happy that the list is laminated.
You know what honey, go ahead, we'll call it an alternative.
Ok, keep my crawler.
All right.
Rachel, will you really let him do this?
Honey, Isabella Rosselini is about to hit. I'm just sorry we do not have popcorn.
Ok, this is enough
'....
You will not dance around with me.
A-ha !!!

Oh-oh-oh, yes! That's right, you take care of those kids!
I'm sorry?
It's me, Joey!
I know you?
Joey!
Oh-ho, yes. Yes, the boy's hands.
All right, it's right.
All right.
Good!
Choose one.
Left! Thank you.
You are welcome.
Ross!
Joey! We should only change.
Yes, absolutely!
Yes.

Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Oh alright!
You know, I ended up spending some good times.
You know, the charity organization has been very successful and they have raised a lot of money and awareness.
So, for what reason?
I mean an illness.
Hey!
Hey!
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said he turned on
Huh. All right.
Oh my God, look! This is Elizabeth!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Ah, to be 13 again.
Yes.

Hey! So, was he excited for the tickets?
No! He blew us up!
What?!
I know!
I can not believe. Can I tell you something? I'm a bit angry with him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
You know what? He did not want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we do not talk to him
Ooooh! Freeze it.
Quite right!
I like it!
Handle?
Yes, you grow up a little. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about ... spring break.
Oh good.
Look, I look, I'm having a lot of fun with you and I do not want to move too fast or exercise a lot of pressure.
So, I'm sorry, I do not think we should go away together yet.
It's ... it's too early.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple of weeks.
No. I think you misunderstood what
You are so adorable.
What! Let's talk about.

Hey!
How do you feel?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again between twelve and fourteen hours.
Ok, so me
And protected them from a tornado?
My God.
I know, the children are sleeping.
Phoebe, what, what happened here ?!
I did it! I took care of the children alone!
But my apartment!
It was the setting for Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
It is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the children alone.
You're right, you're right, I should not scare you.
Because this is what will happen when you and I have children!
When will?
!
Phoebe, you'd take a look at this mess !!!!

Hey!
Hey Ross! The child is kicking!
What?! IS?!
He is not going to kick now. Although we would like to see you do it again.
Hey, when ... when was he going to kick? What happened?
Last night! I heard it and went into Joey's room and he was sleeping
A dreamless sleep.

So come on, boys, tell me all the filth!
Well, the biggest news is that you throw Barry at the altar!
Alright. We talk about reality for a second.
All right.
When you come back home?
What? Guys, I'm not.
Come on, this is us.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I have this job
Waitress?
Ok, I'm not just doing the waitress.
I'm..
I, um ...
I write special offers on the table of special offers and, uh ... and I, uh ...
I take the dried flowers from the vase ... Oh, and sometimes, Artelle lets me put the chocolates on the biscuits.

We go down towards midnight, why do not we come to pick you up then?
So, um, will you bring the truck?
I even let you ring the bell.
My God.
See, here it is, the works of purification!
They are good guys.
Oh, they're firemen.

Your son.
No-no-no. I do not have a son named Jordie. We all agree, the name of my son is Jamie.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we came back to Jordie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramps, leg cramps, leg cramps.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it! Hey, you go to sleep with her, I have cramps.
No, you do not.
All right, that's all. I want both.
Why?
He started!
No, you started it.
You did it!
I do not care. I'm trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
But...
Now you go!
Many thanks.
See what you did.
Yes, listen ...
On

Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What I said?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
My God! It's no wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hello.
Um, you could tell me about Sergei that I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
You did not say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering ....
Okay, ah, before you come back again, umm, you could also tell Sergei that I really like her dress.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
So you're a chef?
I'm also thinking about opening my restaurant.
Oh really.
Monica, I can talk to you about my menu, please. What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Yes but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I have not been able to say two words to each other.
What do you want me to do? Are you sitting here in silence while the three of you have a conversation?
It would be great. Thank you.

so finally we get to the top of the mountain and the empty head here forgets the camera!
Oh, you know, the same thing happened to me once.
When did it happen ?!
You do not remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really cute bird and I wanted to take a picture: I did not have my camera!
Oh yeah. First of all, chasing the Churo boy is not jogging.
Oh, it's so nice you have to try it.
Oh damn! I got it on my pants.
Here, I'll take it.
We'd better take off these pants upstairs or that stain will turn.
Yes. I'll wear them for our appointment tonight.
Oh great!
OK Bye! My God!!
It was amazing!
All right, see? I told you!
Yes, wow, sorry Rach.
I do not think they are brother and sister.
I'm brother and sister !!!

Action!
I found the picture!
What image ?!
My wife's photo! In your backpack!
Have you crossed my personal property?
Why do you have a picture of Paulette in your backpack?
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yes?
Oh you're amazing! And, in this last speech? You wet me
Many thanks.
Here is your call sheet for tomorrow.
I know.

So, Chandler, your parents must have been thrilled when you said you were engaged.
Oh yes, I should probably call them.
I remember when we got engaged for the first time.
Oh, I do not think I've ever heard that story.
Oh dad, you really do not need it
Well, I had pregnant Judy. I still do not know how it happened.
You do not know how it happened ?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
Well, at least you do not hear it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
However, we are really excited about our plans for marriage, and I imagine we will soon be making a big retirement from Monica's wedding fund.
What?
Tell him, Jack, I can not do it.
What happened? You still have Monica's wedding fund, are not you?
We have it. Only now, we call it the house by the sea.

After applying the Waxine and the linen strips to the number one leg,
Done!
Grasp one of the strips of linen with its "simple grip" and remove it with a quick movement without pain.
All right. Ow !!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was not it without pain?
No. It was painful. Oh my God, they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, girls in satin nightgowns do not seem to think it's that bad.
This is because their nerves are probably dampened by being so stupid.
But hey, you know if you do not believe me, please, for my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! My God!!!
Now, are you glad you did not start with the bikini stripes?

now remember that you must imagine me in a kilt.
I can picture you in a short tartan skirt and knee socks.
Do you want to start telling secrets?
No!
Now, remember that I am still learning.
One two three four!
Know the song! Sing together!
So?
No!

My God! That's David!
David who?
David, the scientist boy, David I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart, David!
My God!
Oh, you say someone's name pretty well, they turn around.
Phoebe?
David! What-what are you doing here? Should not you be in Russia?
Yes, I'm alone, I'm in town for a conference. Umm,
Good yes. You're fine too. Did you have a haircut?
Yes. Well, I'm thirty.
Yes.
Yup! Santa is coming!

Hey, I'm really sorry for what happened today in the cafeteria.
It is nothing serious. Hey, you know, do what you have to do. Right?
But hey, it's not just me, I mean scientists and tour guides
Everything.
It's like that everywhere, Joey!
Ok, Monday, bring me here.
Where you work, the waiters eat with the waiters, right?
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
I eat alone in the alley because everyone hates me.
Listen, Ross, really, it's not a big deal.
You know you're wearing a white coat, I'm wearing a blue blazer, if that means we can not be friends at work, so be it.
You know, hey, I understand.
You know?
Hey, when I'm in a comedy and you're in the audience, I'm not talking to you, are you?
So, you know, it's fantastic.
See you tomorrow.
Yes, when we are in the audience, he does not speak to us, but he agitates.

You looked like an idiot.
Hey, I was not the only one who looked like an idiot.
All right?
Do you remember when Ross tried to say "Butternut Pumpkin"?
And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yes, it's the same.
That's all. This is my worst Thanksgiving.
Oh wait! That can not be what Rachel talks about. He did not even know it had happened. So what was it?
Which?
Umm, I-I really do not want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving the past pain and feeling depressed is what makes Thanksgiving.
You know, at least for me.
And of course the Indians.
Look, among all the people, you do not want me to tell this story!

Hi guys.
Hello! Phoebe.
Hi Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologize if yesterday I felt a little nervous about my shower. You know, it's just hormones, you know.
No us
Hormones.
hormones, yes
Your parents'?
Yes, I'm out of town.
Ohh.
Yes, yes, this is it
Yes, it works.
They-they-they can smell the fear.

Bing! I have! And the Bing-ette!
Honey, remember my boss Doug, right?
Yes, bye
Hello. So good news, divorce is final. I signed the documents this A.M.
I did not know you and Carol were divorcing, I'm sorry.
Sorry? Finally I chewed my leg from the bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys!
No chewing for us ladies.
Oh well, give it time.
So divorce, marriage, we have a lot to celebrate.
How about going out for dinner tomorrow night?
I can not think of anything about what we're doing. Why can not I think of something we're doing?
Tomorrow evening is then, I should be out of the field at six.
They continue to launch these cases of sexual harassment against me and keep throwing them out of the park!
Ok. See you tomorrow!
Just for what you know, we will not see him tomorrow.
I-I can not spend another night with that man.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
No.
This is because he was not invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Oh yeah. Boy, cuts of urine

Now maybe you like it only but the whole duck in there! Who cares, you know? Now I have legs
How many times have I told you guys, you
Hi Chandler.
Hey!
Listen, I need that pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Oh, that was yours? Uh, yes, we used it when the duck was launching caterpillars.
William Sonoma
Expect it in 4-6 weeks.
Umm, hey, um, Joey will be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place for us.
Yes, so?
Well, I thought, maybe you'd have wanted to book some time with the best I've ever had.
You know what, sample? I think I'll pass.
Why?
Why?
What is your point?

So, what's your name?
It's Jake.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like knicks?
Yes, great fan.
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday, do you want to go?
Yes that would be great! Let me make sure he does not do anything Tuesday.

Ugh. Ross!
Hello! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo !!
Oh great!
Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.
I got you the best I could because it's not where you want to skimp.
You're a genius, Ross.
Yeah, well it's about $ 112, but what the hell, do you call it 110?
Ok, I'll pay you tomorrow.
All right.
OK Bye!!
So they all started, it was pretty hard to watch them go, you know?
Yes, ok, bye
So I'm leaving!

Hey! Oh, right, tonight was your party.
Oh wow, you're beautiful! Glad you can do it.
Oh well, you know, the gala was supposed to end sooner or later.
Do not go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yes sure. All right, whose ball is it now?
I thought there was not a ball?
Oh come on! He's glad he came, he does not want it to go anywhere, balls flying everywhere!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom.
Oh go ahead! Are you telling people about me?
You two could really hit it! I will go to socialize.
So you work at
Yes, ok, at ease!
I'm sorry?
No, it's all right, you can just leave the Tommy act.
I know what's going on here.
Your Danny wingman, right?
You guys are the best buds.
Frat Bros!
I'm going to talk to a friend.
Yes, yes, go talk to your friend. Tell him: "Nice attempt".
Man! Keep tearing them apart and I keep beating them out of the park!
I think I need a drink.
Yes!

Hey, Phoebe?
No, I can not talk to you! I do not have a fantasy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Look, Phoebe, I just want to apologize for saying that your method was stupid and maybe asking you to be my teacher again.
And-and I promise, I will not touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
Do you really think it's ready?
Uh Huh!
Wow! Cold!
The agreement was at least fair
No!

Well, this was fun.
Yes. Yes, thank you for allowing me to use the phone ... and for saving my life.
Good, goodbye Chandler. I had a big blackout. I'll see you.
Hi, um, I am the account number 7143457.
And, uh, I do not know if you have any, but I'd really like a copy of the tape.

We are starting to see a lot of layers of fabrics and transparent colors. For example a dark blue shirt on a pink ....
I'm really glad we came. You are so cute. I love you.
Ok, this is a fire. Oh yes. Oh yeah.
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'll have to call you back, I have a Schemp in my office.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
But ah, hey, oh, someone is out of the phone, how about a glass of wine near the fire, I could make it go again.
Ross, you're not listening to me, I do not have time to stop.
Come on, Rach, do not you have what, ten minutes?
I have not ten minutes !!
What? Sophie, do you have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross !!! I told you I do not know!
Do not yell at me, this is the best I've seen you for the whole week.
Look, I can not do it now, okay, I have a deadline, you just want to go home, I'll talk to you later.
Yes, but wait ...
Goodbye!
In reality, this is our three-hole hole.

Oh yeah? When?
All right.
I'll tell you what.
When we're 40, if neither of us got married, what do you say and I get together and have one?
Why am I not married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I meant only hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why will not I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
What is that? Is there something fundamentally unreachable about me?
Uh
Well?
My God! This parachute is a backpack!
Hey.
Hey. Ooh, look at yourself, elegant dress.
Did you go home and have you changed?
Yes, well, it's an important day. I want to be pretty. Um, was Dr. Franzblau?
No, I have not seen him.
Well, where is it? It should be here. What happens if the child needs him?
Rachel, what's your relationship with you and doctors, anyway? Was he, like, your father a doctor?
Yes why?
No reason.

I'm the armadillo of the holidays! I'm a friend of Santa and sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa Claus, Holiday Armadillo?
All right, I'll do it only for this time! But you can not tell anyone!
Yup! Yup! Please give it to me!
Yes it's her.
Thank you.
It's incredible! I-I can not believe the sign did not work!
Do you know what would work?
Hmm?
Stop making candy!
But they like it!
You mean you like them.
Could be.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Oh, do you really want to talk about getting people to like you, hilarious guy?

We were on the platform, ready to dance the world in the new millennium, and the boy shouted "CUT!"
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me that you've actually done the routines since the eighth year?
Yes. But of course we had to update it a bit. Hey, by the way, I'm thinking of catching me!
"Because I was about to say that it's not possible that you did the end like you did then!
What? We could do it!
I do not know, I mean you were much bigger, I mean, stronger then.
I can do it, okay? Come on let's go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can not do that!
Now you do it, you're on TV.

Hey!
So, what are you in the market for? We have uh, scarves, tulip postcards ...
Check it? Eh? Yes. This is the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I do not have to buy it anymore, "I'm with a stupid" shirt.
Well, I like it Here.
All right, look, will not you really buy that you are? Do not you think you embarrassed me enough for a day?
Oh, do I embarrass you?
How can I respond when I pretend not to know you?
It's just jealous. You'll be fine; all Londoners wear them!
Oh really? So why nobody wears them?
They are all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing it, in public, you know, you'll spend all afternoon alone.
Oh yeah? If you want to make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat
Good choice.
Thank you.
OK wait. All right, that's all, okay, I'm out of here. I will not be more embarrassed!

So! I'm just an empty vase, eh?
What?
You know, so I do not read so many important books like you, and I do not write make-up poems that seem to be about one thing, but actually they're about something else.
And you know what, I get excited about stupid things, like when I'm mine
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You do not even know me ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, poetry is not about you.
What?
The Empty Vase does not talk about you. My child, you make me so sad that you would think so.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe ...
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. Do you feel better now?
Oh yeah.

Ok, come on. Forward-Stop! Ok, back-stop! Ok, forward-stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross, forget it. This guy has totally stuck you.
It's yours?
Well, really
No-no-no! It's mine! It's ... it's mine.
Friend, you really need this car.
All right.
Ok, here's what we'll do.
Ok, I'm about to get into this mini-van and put it in neutral.
You guys push forward so Ross can get out of his seat.
All right?
All right, here we are.
Pull your ass !!!
!

So he said that by the year 2030, there will be computers able to perform the same number of functions as a real human brain.
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and memories into this computer ...
... and live forever like a car!
That's like Janine, you-you-know what, do you know what we're doing now?
You and me, we are interacting.
Yes, I have to go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!

David, can you help me ?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Oh, sure. This is a combination of the Bernoulli principle and Newton's third law of motion.
To see?
Yes, it's the same as "it has something to do with the wind".
All right, I'm going to get some things for the trip.
Oh, I should go too.
Oh, now ... tomorrow you want to share a taxi to the airport or Mike and I'll see you there.
Oh ... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he'll be there.
And she was like, "Oh, do not worry!
I asked him.
You absolutely agree to see you! ".
So now I have to go, so he will think I completely agree to see him!
That you are not, because you completely hung it on him!
Exactly!
And you want him to eat his heart so you should look fabulous!
I did not even think about it! Aaargh,
Hey Phoebe, I'm shopping with Charlie, why do not you come and I'll help you find something.
Ok, it will be great!
Oh, is not it cute? You three try the slutty lingerie together.
That's not what we'll do!
Why do you want to ruin it, who is it that hurts?

Julie hello! Chandler Bing, I think you remember me.
Hi Skidmark.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
It is quite clear
Ah, I owe you long apologies. I should never have separated you because you were overweight.
Is that why you broke up with me?
You-you-you did not know. Well, I guess my work here is over!

Ni-chou chi-ma!
Ross! Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ....
Hi everyone.
I just wanted to thank you for our talker before.
Oh, God, no problem. So will you go with the pending thing?
Well, I was going to, but after talking to you, I talked to Joey.
What did he do, what did he say?
Basically he told me to get over myself and I do it, you know.
So I was thinking about what you said and I was thinking about what he said and, well, in my way I got to have sex like that tonight.
.
.

Oh great!
We could not keep our eyes away all night and then, every now and then, you know, he would bend over and caress my hair and touch my neck.
Okay, stop Phoebe, you're making me crazy.
All I could think of was, you know, "Will you kiss me, will you kiss me?"
And he?
I'm a Mrs. Monica, I do not kiss and I do not say. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay, I understand. I got it.
I like it so much that I feel like I've had 10 drinks today and only had six.
Oh, I did not have that feeling since I started dating Chandler.
Wow, I will never have this feeling again, will I?
You look like a boy.
No, a boy would have said "I'll never sleep with anyone else".
My God!
I'll never be able to sleep with anyone else!
I was so busy planning the wedding that I forgot all the things that I would have surrendered!
I mean, I'll never have a first kiss again.
You'll have one last kiss.

Thank you so much for coming back.
Oh well, you're here. Yes, and I was worried that it would be uncomfortable.
I know Mona, listen to me.
First of all, I'm so sorry for my father who screamed at you, but I totally felt you.
You will have to tell me how you did it.
Focus.
All right. Um ... Okay, yes, Ross and I were going out. And yes, we will have a baby. But we are
Well, where's that turkey?
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!

No.
No!
Yup!
Ahh.
Oh, look at that Monica?
I've just eliminated all your best scores, how sad.
Ok, I'm next Do not do it! Do not start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
Oh sorry. I did not hear you on all winnings.
Chandler! Phoebe makes the game!
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yes. But I thought it was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
However, it seems that it is not worth making a whole turkey for just three people. All right? It's a lot of work.
But you must have Thanksgiving turkey!
I mean, Thanksgiving without turkey is like the fourth of July without apple pie!
Or Friday without two pizzas!
All right! If it means so much for you! But ... there will still be a ton.
No, it will not be there! I promise I'll finish that turkey!
All right, are you telling me that you can eat an entire turkey in one sitting?
Quite right!
Because I am a Tribbiani!
And that's what we do!
I mean, we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we do not read a lot or we run very fast, but damn it!
We can eat!

Well?
Wow! It is huge! It is much larger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Watch this!
Oh! You have a window!
Yes, really! With a beautiful view of ...
Oh look! That guy is peeing!
Hello.
Hello.

You know what? I can not do it with my left hand! Please, help me with this too?
Ohh.
All right. We use this brush.
All right. This stuff?
Yes.
All right.
Careful. Light. Ok, you know how, just sweep the lid. All right? Just sweep it.
Oke-dokey.

Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, technically it's not a zoo in itself, it's more than an interactive wild life experience.
Let me ask you some questions, will not you, Marcel?
Yup.
Do you fight with other animals?
No, no, he is very docile.
Even if it was ... cornered?
Well I do not know. Why?
Uh, how are you handling small items?
It can hold a banana, if this is whatcha means ...
How about a hammer or a small blade?
Why ... why ... why would he need a blade?
Well, if you're faced with a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you have to give something to the baby.
Otherwise it is only cruel.
Lu- him- he went in, he- he went into San Diego.
We come back from our walk and the phone ... was ringing ...
... He is inside
He is inside! Oh, did you hear, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You're making a big mistake here.
I mean, San Diego is all right, but if you give it to me, I'll put it in touch with a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of your income.

My sample is in the room and I just want to thank everyone who knocked on the door while I was in there.
I really helped speed up the process!
Janice!
You did not go?
Oh!
Sid is still in his room.
I do not allow porn at home, so it's like a holiday for him.
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?
Yes! Yes ... The hard part is over!
This is not the hard part, honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean, are not you worried about the results?
I have not ... I have not thought about the results yet ... I just thought everything would be fine.
Oh! Well, you know what? Probably it is.
Phoebe, where's your bag?
No, no! Give it to me!
You can not have it
Give it to me!
No
I will go there.
Oh yeah.
Phoebe, come here
Haha!
Damn you Monica Geller, the dash Bing!

What we did is wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with someone who was not alive during the Bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Ethan, concentrate. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, it's different. My lie did not make one of us a criminal in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I was not thinking. I was too busy to fall ...
Do not say that
...in love with you.
Really?
Sorry.
Well, fall out of it.
You know, you should not even be here, it's a school night.
Oh god, oh god.
They're like those women you see with bright guys named Chad.
I'm Joan Collins.
Who?

Exactly, still no child! Let's go people! Please create some space!
Honey, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
You. As if I had not done enough.
Listen, I ... I know how unhappy you are, I wish there was something I could do.
I mean, I'd like to be a seahorse.
Because with the seahorses is the male, they bring the children.
And then me too, I would be far in the sea.
God. I've never been so uncomfortable in all my life!
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember near the end
Oh Phoebe, this is a great story.
Can you tell me when you'll have cold tea?
Oh God, get out!
Go out!!
Go out!!
Go out!
!
Let.

All right, I know! I know. Yes, everything will be fine.
Oh my God. What will you do now?
I can not watch!
Oh.
Seriously, how can you watch this?
Are not you scared?
Terrified.

Oh-hey-hey-hey! Here you are!
Umm, listen, there's something I think you should know.
Oh, this is for you, did you go out with the nurse?
Yes, Joey has already told me, and I'm so good.
I mean, you and I are alone, you know, we're nothing, we're joking.
Umm, I was actually about to tell you I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just joking, then, maybe I
Well! Maybe I'll do it too!
Well, it was big enough. I-I-I-I-I had to throw away most of it.
You-you-have-threw away my sandwich!
MY PANINO? !!!
MY PANINO !!!!!!

What's the problem, Phoebe?
He canceled! My namesake was deleted by me!
What?!
Yes, he asked to leave the city suddenly.
He's avoiding me, he does not want to tell me where my father is.
She knows, and she will not tell me.
Aww Pheebs, how disgusting!
Yeah, well, do not do 'Aww Pheebs, how disgusting!' me again
Where are you going?
Well, he's out of town so there must be something in his house that tells me where my father is.
Uh, Phoebe, some people call it break in and go in.
Well, is there any of those people here ?!
Oh my God, me too!
I knew it, wow !!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Ohh, so cute.
Uh-huh, good! But I'm still angry with you.
I know. I'm angry too.
Well, do you want something to eat? I'm a little hungry.
Hey! Me too!
All right, stop it. Now you're doing it just to drive me crazy.

Ok, you can do it.
It's like pulling out a band-aid.
Do it really fast and then the wound is exposed.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we are. I do not think we should go out any more. Janice.
All right. Well, here it is. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

My God! That guy at the bar is completely checking you!
Really? My God, it's really nice.
Just do it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
I'm just saying, take your number just in case.
But no: Chandler is in an accident and can not perform sexually and would like you to take a lover to meet the needs that he can no longer satisfy.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered, but I'm engaged.
Well, you should be embarrassed.
I did it, but it was really fun.

Hey.
Chandler. I heard it was you.
What?!
Unagi. I am always aware.
Ok, do you know that the unagi is an eel?
What happens?
I can not figure out what to do Monica.
Oh, why do not you do one of your little jokes.
I'm going crazy! All right? Do you have anything around here that looks like home-made?
You know what?
She would have loved it.
Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I did it in the sixth grade.
Yes, I think I could use it. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yes, yes, except for Apollo 8, it did not actually land on the moon.
But you-you-can write that umm, your love makes me orbit around the moon twice and come back safe and sound.
Wait a minute, I can not give you this.
Why not?
Because he says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Yes, see you
Hey, thank you very much.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupido who brought her here.
No, just an old normal flying dwarf.

Oh. Oh, I can not believe Clark put me on my feet!
It could still appear.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
That's all?
I should go to happier things, okay? Umm, why do not you talk about your beautiful wedding?
Well, really, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
Um, it will be a small ceremony.
Uh, baby!
We are not even sure why we are living it.
In reality it will be just a family.
Oh, wait for the two of you to think of me as a family ?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; Do you want me to sing?

Come to me. No-no, come here to me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, did you bring Joey?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Whoa! Do you know what Katie? I must tell you that I_I_I think you are the one who is too much.
Ohh, Joey has the best friends!
Ohh, and the most beautiful girl!
You are so sweet!
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Oww !!!! Joey, he just kicked me.
Huh.
Well? Will you not do something?
Uhh.
You'd better do something, or I'll get out of that door right now! Well? Are you going for?
Nah.

How could you take a hitchhiker ?! It could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
Do not you think she asked him before entering?
You know what? I'm not talking to you! Go back to sleep! And you, you're a rapist ?!
No!
Do you like car games?
Yes, do you know the license plate game?
I
Ooh, I'll play! I will play!
Ninth! You need your sleep. Night night! Shh!

Phoebe, can you help me choose an engagement ring for Monica?
I can not understand it!
It's so difficult!
I should get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah!
Paper cut!
Now, did you tell someone else?
No, I do not want to tell anyone because I do not want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you approached me as I looked at the ring brochures.
Yes well, once again do not knock pay. I just wish you had not been in the bathroom.
Me too.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! So, Chandler, do you want to go to the cafe?
Oh alright.
Yes, coffee.
Oh perfect, we were just going to see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, not because we have the other place.
How rude.
Oh sorry. Do you want to bite?

The stripper stole the ring !! The stripper stole the ring !! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What?
The ring is gone!
Ugh.
Just a second, give me a minute to wake me up ... Ah-ha-ha !!
You lost the ring!
You're the worst man ever!
Friend, it's not funny!
What am I going to do ?!
I go to bed last night, it's all great!
I wake up this morning, the stripper is gone and the ring is gone!
Did you sleep with the stripper?
Obviously!!

What's the difference ?!
Well, I'm just ... if the dough goes with the pants, you can make yourself a pair of pants and she will not know the difference!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Friend, what am I going
Uh, Rachel is here, good luck friend, let me know how it works.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, your timing could not be better. I'm extinguishing fires everywhere.
All right. All right. All right. Joey, I have
What-what is, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so great, but you just have to promise me that you can not tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I do not want to know!
Yup! Yup! Yes, you want to know! This is incredible!
I do not care, Rach! Look, I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can not tell anyone!
What? What secrets? Do you know the secrets? What are they?
And you should not gossip!
I know I know! I can not keep this, so I take the phone
I'm not listening to you!

Oh! Yay! Look! There is a piece that has no floor!
Stick by your side!
Hey, let's go now!
All right, what do we have?
Uhh, I do not believe in these crazy diets, you know, just everything in moderation.
I'll take those to go. For children.
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you. What happened?
He was so stupid, I said some things in an interview that I should not have said.
But believe me, it will not happen today.
Understood. So, what did you say then?
Well, I said it

Has!
So you like drums!
This is great!
You know, I was worried that, you know, they might have an unbearable life situation.
All right, all right, well, apparently not!
So, yay!
Hey-hey, Phoebe, take a look, we've already learned a song. Ready? One two three four...
Tequila!!
It is funny.

Whoa-whoa, did Treeger make you cry?
Yup! And he said really bad things that were only partially true.
I go over there and teach that boy a lesson.
Joey, please do not do it. I think it's better that we forget it.
It is easy for you to say that you have not been nearly killed.
All right, school is underway!
My God! Is this a gym card?
Oh yes, a member of the gym. I try to go four times a week, but I've lost the last 1200 times.
So why do not you fire?
Do not you think he tried? Do you think about me
Who is Maria?
Oh Maria. You can not say no to her, it's like a spandex-covered lycra in the gym.
Do you need me to go over there with you and hold your hand?
No!
So you're strong enough to face it alone?
Oh no, you'll have to come.

Thank you.
Thank you. Mon?
Hmm?
Phoebe, I do not think anyone is angry about that.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Does anyone eat it?

Phoebe!
Hey!
Listen, do you know how, when you wear your pants and lean forward, I look at your underwear?
Yes!
Well, when Jake did, I saw that she was wearing women's underwear!
I know. They were mine.
Oh. No! No wait, it's strange!
No it is not! We were just joking and I dared to try them.
That's strange!
I'm wearing her briefs right now.
It's quite hot.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great to keep the lipstick.
Yes, I do not know.
IS! Do you know what Jake says? Female underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yes, the next thing you know will tell you that your high heels are good for your posture!
There's nothing wrong with Jake! All right? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Oh yes, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink ponds.
I'm just saying that only a completely safe man with his masculinity could walk in underwear for women!
I do not think you could ever do it.
Hey! I
Ok, anything.
Concupiscence of the flesh
What?
I do not know. A cowboy theme?

Hey, is it okay to come in?
Obviously! Oh Joey, this ring ... it's beautiful, I love it!
Yes, look Rach, there's something I have to tell you.
Hey!
Hey! Are you ready to try breastfeeding again?
Yes! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think it will not take my breasts?
All right, honey, it takes some children to have it, but do not worry. It will happen
Yowsa!
Okay honey, you can do it. Just open it and put it in your mouth.
Dear Sir.
I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
Oh yes, I think ...
Oh look, she's moving away again!
Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Does not it look scared?
You know, I do not really know her.

Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
No. But do not worry, I'm sure I'm still there.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, an a-gogo career advisor. I added "a-gogo".
Actually, tomorrow night a little depends on how it goes tonight.
Oh, listen, tonight ...
No, no, no, do not let me save you.
The only reason he's dating me is because I said I could bring a friend for his friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend seems like this ...
Pathetic mess?
I know, but ... come on, buddy, she's in need, she's vulnerable.
I'm thinking, cha-ching!
Thank you.
Look, you have not been out with a woman from Janice.
You're doing it.
Hello. She said yes.
Yup! Way to go, friend! You still have the egg, eh?

"Happy birthday!"
You're paying for that.
What? No-no is her birthday!
You sang Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But really
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damn!
Rachel? Hello!
Hello!
Did you tell your sister to ask?
Good yes
Oh wow!
I mean, wow!
I mean, I_I_I think it's pretty but I_I never thought I'd go out with her, ever!
Really?!
Yes, but after saying it was OK, I thought, "Why not?!"
Oh so so I never really.
I have to say you're a much bigger person than me.
I mean, after all we've been through, I-you know, I'd like to have a brother to return.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you've got my blessing.
Oh-ho, and mine!

Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye bye.
No-no wait-wait! I can not just hang up! Please, please, talk to me.
Well, I have only one thing to do today. I think I can reject it.
Yes! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
It's just that, uh, I worked for ten years in this meaningless work, without life and nobody here even knows I exist!
Chandler?
I - I'm sorry?
Absolutely not, I'm sure people know you exist!
Oh yeah?
I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
I talked with you for five minutes to kill myself and no one even looked up from the desk.
Hang-hang on.
Hello everyone!
Uh, I will kill myself!
I will come back to you.
I did not get anything.
Wait.
Uh, hey Marge!
Ehh, nothing.
Anything.

Apparently, there's a million guys out there who can play with Mac, and there's only this robot and this guy who controls it!
I did not know he could have me fired!
What am I going to do?
You know, Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I have a problem to deal with here.
No darling, you have to conquer the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You have to kiss a nice robot ass!
It's not a bad idea.
Yes.
Ok, but if I had to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting it here with you guys anymore.
Well, I actually saved myself a little for you Pheebs.
So you think Joey is more charming than me?
Yes! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Yes, you want it.
"Wishes."
Why are you screaming?
Whoa, that

Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well, it's an appointment.
A date ?!
No, no Phoebe, you must be wrong, because I know you would not have planned a date on the same night you planned a friend!
Come on, Joey, do not make me feel bad about this.
No, I'm going !!
Quite right!
Yes, you made me feel really guilty of going out with that girl!
As if I had done something terrible for you!
And now Phoebe, you're doing the same thing!
That - It's not the same thing! This is
Okay, well, my girlfriend from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
Ok, anything.
You know what?
I have no time to convince you because it's only been here for four hours, and I'm going to see it!
Well!
Yes!
Well!
Yes!
What are you still doing here? I told you, ravioli with lobster!

Sorry for the delay, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur .. what .. anyway.
Hello.
Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?
Ross.
Hi, Susan. Good shock. Good shock. So, we're just waiting ...?
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. All right. And it's-
She.
- if, naturally, you ... are familiar with our ... special situation?
Yes, and she is very supportive.
Ok, it's great. No, I'm ... Oh.
Thank you.
Quack, charlatan
Ross? This opens my cervix.
Barry?
Let's go inside
Are you sure?
Yes! Okay okay. Robbie will be here for hours.
Eh?!
So what's up?
... Flame boy.

Do you use the cups? Yup! I think she does it. Do you use the dishes? Yup! I think she does it.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
No-no, let me in!
Phoebe?
Yes!
Can you hold on for a minute?
No, you must let me in now!
You're alone?
Yup!
All right.

Let it go!
No! You let yourself go!
No!
Why did we stay in the field holding the ball?
I do not know. I guess other people do not care enough.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Give me this!
Let it go!

You know what?
Umm?
I bet you could stay there.
I have five dollars says you can not.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or simply fall. This too is fine.
Knick fan?
Oh yeah.
Oh boy, they suck.
Hey, listen, madam ....... whoa.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice Shot. You know what, he could not hit the water if he was on a boat.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
The Celtics.
The Celtics? Has. They could not hit a boat if ... wait. They suck, okay?
Oh shut up. You know, it's a year of reconstruction. You ... waah!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me take my father. Hey, we need a father here! We need a father!
There is no father.
Oh, oh, sorry.
OK it's good. I'm fine. I'm ... oh!
Oh, ok Just this way. All other pregnant women seem to enter here.
Ok.

Honey, just give me another chance, ok, let's start all over again. We will return to Aruba.
Dr. Farber, we have a bit of an emergency here ... Jason Costalano is suffocating on his catch.
Oh God...
I'll be there, Bernice.
Look, please, please do not go anywhere, ok?
I'll be back, right away.
All right.
Ok, we'll be here!
Hate you!
Did you see how he was sweating when he got out of there?
Feel sweet, if I'm trolling the ball too much, you jump right in there and take a couple of punches because I'm telling you, this seems
Yes ... I'm pretty sure I'll marry him anyway.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the boy is the devil! It's Satan in a gown!
Look, I know it's not perfect, but the truth is, in the end, I still want to be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Oh God.
I hope you can find a way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor ...?
And I hope Barry does not kill you and you eat in Aruba.

Listen, Robert will be here at any moment, will one of you say that?
Oh.
Please, now, no, every time I see it, it's like "Lose?" "Are you watching me?"
We can not tell him, you can not go to a guy you barely know and talk about his ... things.
He is right, even if he has to say something complementary.
Hey!
Hey.
So are they ready for the gym? They have this new climbing wall, we can identify ourselves.
No, I can identify you from here.
What?
Ok, listen to Robert ...
I have no time for this.
No, this is the game.
That you just gave up very quickly.
Have you seen Joey?
What's up?
Oh, just this! You know what's really my fault, because the couch is usually where we are
Hey, someone wants to give me one of those cards.
What is going on?
It's resizing my floor.
Yo !! Spackel boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you've started this, you'll finish it.
He started my first!
Build the Cinderelly unit, lay the Cinderelly card.

Come Chloe! Finish first with your client. Come Chloe! Come Chloe !!
Can I help you?
Uh Oh.
Uh, you know what, we have second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
Chloe, come with me, there are some guys here who have a crush on you.
Ok, this hurt us
Hi guys. I have not seen you since this morning.
Well ah, ........ you know.
Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Both of them?
Could be. Does it scare you?
Relax. It's only D.J .. of Issac at the Philly. You should come.
We will be there.
Great. I ah, see you then.
All right, rock on.

Umm, candles, champagne, yes, anniversaries are great.
Because you know that love lasts forever, you know.
Nothing like this in this life, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Oh God, Ross, I'm so sorry.
Yes good.
You know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we really can get in, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Oh yes, I'd like to.
Oh great! Me too.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.

And why do you care so much?
Why! You could live my fantasy!
Did you have any fantasies about Emily?
No! you know,
Is that why you were the only one in junior high school with that Ukrainian boy?
Yes, besides his mother used to put sour cream on everything!
Ahh.
You love her?
We said it would only take two weeks, you know?
You love her!
What is love really?
Ohhh, me
I'm a good kisser.
Then you two can, you can sneak in the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a hostess arrives. I watched porn too.

So in practice this is very easy. Read from the screenplay and try to sell as many toner as possible.
All right, I can do it! Oh, by the way, me
Because we do not do a trial.
Oh ok. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I talk to your supply manager please?
I'm responsible for supplies.
Umm, okay I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.

Kathy! Kathy! Hello!! Kathy! Kathy! (He does not hear it and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as a theme
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say "Hey!"
Hey!
All right.

Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your old blouses and high-school clothes?
Yes, I think I have a little somewhere here. Why?
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, Rach! I did a lot of things on this side of the room. If only you could launch your bags.
Bloomingdale
Oh my God, are you jobless?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a
All right!
Come on, do not peek!
Our eyes are closed and we are about to cross the road. Very good.
Okayyyyy, open up!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this
Yes, it's for our catering business!
I think I know that girl.
All right, umm, we will not really keep it that way.
No?
No, we are going to paint over the sword and replace it with a baguette.
Oh!
And besides, we do not know what to do with this.
Oh yes, I know her definitely.

You do not know ?! Rachel, you screwed up my girlfriend!
All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with someone else?
You know, hey! You're the one who finished it, remember?
Yes, because I was
Do you still love me?
Noo.
Do you still love me.
Oh yes, so you ... you love me!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you want to say, do you want, come back together?
Noo!
Could be!
I do not know.
Ross, I still can not forgive you for what you did, I can not, just, but sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like that ...
What?!
I alone, I feel, I - I alone ...
What?
I feel...
Noo !! I do not care! I'm not, I will not play poker one on one with you for practice!
But I did the cards !!
Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Good night.
Do you want to play strip poker for practice?

What are you doing?
The key is locked in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on. Caution. Caution.
It still does not work.
Yes I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a small accident.

Is not it amazing ?! Monica and Chandler get married.
I know, they will be
Ohh, I mean two lovers, how often does it happen?
Not
No! I'm so happy for them!
Me too! I'm so happy for them!
I am so happy and not jealous at all.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
I mean, I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I want to say what is 2%? It's nothing.
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Yes me too.
Hey, guys, guys, Chandler scene?
Wh-no, but you know who stopped here looking for you, Tennille.

Do you remember that guy from the cooking school I told you about to put coriander with everything?
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Well, I will replace him as a food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Wow, Monica! What an extraordinary opportunity to influence dozens of people.
How could you say yes, and of our catering business?
Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, plus I can take all of you for one
Yay!!
Oh, in that case - Yay! I was the one to jump aboard.
Oh.
Hey guys! Hey, Ross, fast question for you. Are you ready for the party?
Hello.
Hey, it's me.
I know you can not bear being in my own room, so I thought I'd try to apologize by phone.
All of me
Hello.
Look, I should never have kissed your girlfriend, but I am
Stop calling !!
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our daily challenge of $ 1,000.
All right!
What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything

Are you still at home, Joseph Francis Tribbiani? !!
Umm, I think it's still out. What's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I was scheduled tonight with Joey and she left me this note.
"Phoebe, I can not do it, I have an appointment, see you later, big dad." Big dad?
Oh, this is a nickname we were trying.
Hey, you know what nickname has never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Hey!
Oh! Here is Joseph Francis!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you giving me the name for? I left you a note!
So?! This does not give you the right to abandon me!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is a chance to have sex!
Phoebe is right, this is the rule.
I do not accept this rule.
When we make plans, I expect you to present yourself.
Ok, I can not be a way to kill time until you meet someone better!
You know, boyfriends and friends come and go, but this is for life!
Did you know it was there?
No.
How long have we been home?
About half an hour.
love

Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Ooh nice.
So, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh right! I completely forgot about it.
Well, I thought a lot and looked at my life
Yes?
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Wow.
One thing is missing.
What is that?
It is time for me to conquer the physical world.
All right.
Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Do you want what?
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It is the most intense physical competition in the world, it is forbidden in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
Ok, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fights, I even designed my octagonal training ring.
And I suppose you used a ringtone designer for this.
Yes.
Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.
I want you close enough to smell the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.

Is it okay to enter?
Yes, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger has again issued an acoustic signal.
Yes, I know, guess who issued it?
What?!
I am the broken spleen.
Why should you do it?
Because you should not be with him. You should stay with me.
Really?
Yes!
When you were talking about Roger, he was killing me!
Look, things like last night do not happen.
You know?
Or at least not to me.
Or with the other two women, in the morning you know I was just lying there and I could not wait to go out with my friends, but with you I always know with a friend.
Chandler!
I know you probably do not want to go out with me, you know why I make too many jokes and I've never had a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor"
There was only one woman, was not there?
No, there were two.
Including me?
Oh yeah.

Hey!
Welcome back!
Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
I do not know, I'm still pretty tired this afternoon.
Why?
Uh, sex.
What sex?
Our sex
We did not have sex.
Well, if I had not had sex with you, I had sex with someone who looked a lot like me
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Oh my God Stu! I - I can not believe you did it! Now are you absolutely sure it's a prostitute?
Either that or her is just the best and most expensive date I've ever had.

Would you look at them? Will I ever find a boyfriend? An old maid will die.
I'm your mother
Ehh?
Oh, and then Monica joked that she would not go out with a guy like Chandler ...
Hello.
... and he could not let it go, and ... I do not really know what happened with that.
Oh, oh!
And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, arrives, and Rachel convinced her to save her mind.
And then Ross and Rachel are kissing, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I do not know what happened there ...
You know what, wait, let me go get Chandler.

Mr. Morse, can I talk to you for a moment?
Well, yes, I lied first.
Oh!
Oh God
Now you know how you really feel.
Oh-oh, this is a risky little game!
Will you really do it?
Yes. I'm going to have a baby. I'm going to have a baby. I'm going to have a baby!
With whom?
Ah, it's not yet time.

You said I was boring - Ohh!
When did I say you were boring ?!
Oh my God, now I remember! We were playing chess!
Phoebe! You and I have
Oh come on!
Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off the energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!
Ok, there's a

All right, I'm leaving!
Because I'm not going to spend another day with someone who wants to sabotage my every move.
It's you, Rachel!
Yes I understand.
And you! I throw myself against you and you say no, how gay are you?
You take care of Jill.
Okay, see you!
And Bye-Bye!
Hello.
I can not believe Jill left. I can not help it, I opened a gate.
What do you say, you're moving!
Look! This is ridiculous. We should pack you !!
Hey, how are you guys?
Great! Monica is moving!
I'm not!
Oh really?! So why are all your things in this box?
Ok, guys. Guys, I think I know what's going on here. Ok, guys
No Phoebe, I'm crazy!
Well, deeply deep!
Yes, I'm just crazy!
So keep running.

All right!
Oh, here's that trench you wanted.
Oh great! Wow! Yes, it's comfortable.
Yes?
Oh! Here we
All right, you know what, we talked too much about London, right?
No.
I'm sorry.
It's just because I could not be there.
Because all I have to do now is pregnant things, it just makes me lightly.
Sorry.
What happened?
Well, you know, some of this, a little bit of that. I made an appointment tomorrow night.
See, did not I tell you? You're already past Ross!
Well
Go out!

I did not see the fast song coming.
Shh.
Shh.
Do not try to talk, we'll take you to your room, we'll take a bath, you'll be fine.
Oh thanks.
It's so sweet!
Yes.
No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
Tell me, I feel like I'm holding the fort all by myself.
Is Joey true?
Yes.
Wait a minute!
No!
I'm beautiful!
I'm the one who danced with the kids all night!
How small are your feet?
!

Uhh, you're sorry to sit there. I'm saving it for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I did not know he had a nickname.
Oh, he will not sit here.
Only people with white coats sit there and only people with blue jackets sit here.
Yes, it must have fallen a few blocks back. I just thought I had hit a dog.
All right.
Listen, you could put Kathy, I want to apologize.
Oh yes friend. Joey.
Hey.
Oh no good, do not worry.
Yes, no, stop apologizing, it's all right.
Yes!
I will talk to you tomorrow.
I should probably go.
Yes, yes! Yes.
I forgot my bag.
Oh.
No, I really forgot my bag.

A new place for a new Ross. I'm going to have you and all the guys from the finished work, once you know, furnished.
I must say that it's nice to see you standing again.
Well, I am. And that whole anger is definitely behind me.
I wonder if it's time to get together with our team at the museum?
Oh, Donald, it would be great. I'm totally ready to go back to work. I what? No! What are you doing? !!

.... and 12, 22, 18, four ... What?
I explained the tits.
Ross, but I in exchange for another box of mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
What?
Monica, I'm cutting you.
No.
No, just, just another couple of boxes.
It-it-it is not a big deal, alright, I'm-I'm cool.
You have to help me with another couple of boxes!
Lun, look at yourself. You have cookies on your neck.
Oh God!
So how many have you sold so far?
Check it. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh my God, how did you do it?
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as "Laser Floyd" was coming out of the planetarium, without even trying to sell 50 boxes!
It was then that came to my mind, the key to my success, "the munchies". So I started hitting the NYU dormitories around midnight.
I'm selling cookies from the case.
They call me: "Friend of cookies!"
Ok, stop doing what you're doing, I need padded bags, I need to lick up .....
Well, hey, who did these resumes for you?
Myself! On my computer.
Like an eclipse.

Hello.
Hey. Soaps? Shampoo? Are you really taking all these things?
Why not? It is integrated into the room price.
Yes, but you do not need it - What is this?
Wire!
Point! Where are disposable cameras?
Which disposable cameras?
The cameras? Do you remember last night I told you to get them?
No you did not.
Yup! Remember? Just before cutting the cake, I went to you and I said
Oh-oh yes, you-came to me and I asked you if I could do you a favor, and my uncle Murray came to you and gave you a check.
And then you said, "Why do they call a check?
Why not a Yugoslav? "
Yes, then you did it.
So you do not have cameras?
No. I'm sorry, buddy.
So? What? What? They left! Monica is going crazy!
Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I will help you look for them.
Great.
In-in three minutes.

Uhh, Rachel, my parents
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello. Well, Joshua, those $ 500 were for shopping.
What?
This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-this-it's not what it is.
See, see, all right, I work in fashion, see e-e, this is a real dress in reality.
È-è, they are wearing it in Milan, so part of my work is too much to wear clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report to my superiors in
Perhaps in L.A?
Yup!
Here it is.
So, have you already eaten some children?
Well, we were going to do it later - I mean umm, the next one.
Well, we're starving, why do not we go get something to eat?
Oh yes, well yes, waste this baby, I'm just walking around the house.
So let's go eat.
Yup.
You will wear it. We will eat and of course you will wear it.

Well, I guess I should have thought about my wife and children before talking to Chef Geller!
Thank you.
Yup! It looks like it will be a Christmas leeeo at the house of dragons this year.
Quite!
Lean skinny lean!

Let me see.
This.
Triscadecaphobia.
The fear of
No! No, afraid of the number 13.
Fear of
It's possible, they really have sharp edges.
All right, Chandler, you're awake.
Wait a minute, I think I have the right to use my Angel Pass for a free shift?
This game does not make sense!
You know what? You're just angry because you're losing.
Oh, come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
All right. Chandler, you can turn the wheel or choose a Google card.
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I do not care
You, you have to choose Mr. Bing.
Or, it makes no difference.
Choose, stupid!
I will take a card.
Ok, you chose the Gimmie card! Get all Ross points!
What?!
This game is rather fun.
Do not you think it's a little strange that you have all my points for you
I do not think competitors have to talk to each other.

Hello? Oh, hello Ross! To see? Other people call me!
Ross very funny!
Very realistic and fun.
All right.
Oh no-no-no, I was not saying goodbye to your lady.
Whoa, maybe I was!
Hey, Monica, this totally sexy girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Enter there man! Flirt, mix!
Yes, I_I_I'm down with that.
Ok, here it is.
How are you?
It worked!
He is waving.
Ok, I-I-I will be finished.
Let's see, she's on the third floor
Wow! She's pretty, is she?
Tell me about it, eh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, it's just Monica! Ewwuck!

Hey!
Hey!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, it's great!
To see? And you do not care if people are watching, it's just for a second cause, so you're gone!
Gone! I mean his incredible Phoebe. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Search for the horse! Sorry!

Oh, come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just crossed the hall! IS
Ahh! Are not you dressed yet?
Am I naked again ?!
We should meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah, okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them, I mean, is it okay if they come to visit them?
Wh?! What about my allergies ?!
Oh, right, your allergies. All of her, she hates you.

Shoot! We're out of soda.
Oh, I'm going to get you a little.
Really?!
No! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Phoebe, how did it go?
Well, um, my mother's friend, Phoebe, is actually my mother's birth.
I found a dry sea.
Sweetie, what are you talking about?
Oh, my new mother, who-who is a big, fat abandonment!
Whoa, wait, Phoebe, wait a second! Do not you want to stay here and talk about it?
No. I'm alone, I want, I need to be alone.
Monica!
Oh.

Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yeah baby!
So we never heard of your wedding!
We were surprised that we were not invited.
No, no, it was only our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
What's wrong? Custard? Good. Marmalade? Good. Meat? Goooooood.

Hey!
Hey!
Hello!
So, do you want to come to dinner at the restaurant in the next few weeks?
Sure!
I would like!
Well, you
Well, I can not give you a massage, because my license has been revoked again!
Phoebe, what happened?
Well, it was an accident ... You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand slips!
I've got a surprise for you? Pack up!
Oh no, you guys should not get divorced for 7 years!

Umm, this is nice.
I know, is not it?
No, I mean it, this looks really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Yes! And I also sold it.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Well, if you want to have a drink later, we can.
Oh yes, it looks fantastic. Oh, and listen, it's, it will be ....
I know. Thank you.

So? Come on! Explain Geller! First take my pregnant Rachel!
Did you get pregnant Rachel ?!
Who did?!
You did it!
Yes. Yes, yes, I did it. But ... but it was, it was only one thing a night. It meant nothing.
Oh? Really? Is this what my daughter means to you? Anything?
No! No sir, she means a lot to me. I mean, I'm interested-I-I love Rachel.
What?!
Oh but not that way. I mean, I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her as one, like a friend.
Oh really? Is that how you treat a friend? Do you get into trouble and then refuse to marry her?
Hey! I offered to marry her!
Wh
But I did not want to.
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?
Rogue ?!
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.

Yes, Fran.
I know what time it is, but I'm watching WENUS and I'm not happy! ...
Oh, really, really, really?
Well, let me tell you something ... it will interest you, because I care!
You got it right?
Good!
Whooooaaaa ....

Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men?
Hey, Joey. So you heard about the new boy?
I could have birds.
Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner.
All right, bye bye
Ok, Janice. Janice. You must give me Janice. It was not about being picky.
We'll give you Janice.
I miss Janice though. "Hi, Chandler Bing."
"My God."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it, there, faster!"
Stop with the broom, let's make no noise.
We won. We won!
Mr. Heckles.
How did it happen?
It had to be radical. They found a broom in their hands.
It's terrible.
I know. Yesterday I was sweeping. It could have been me.
Of course, you could. You never know.
You never know.

Oh sorry.
Where's Chandler?
Oh, he needed time to grieve.
I am free! I am free!
This should do it.

Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, I've been there since 4 this morning.
Where did you get fruit at four in the morning?
I went to the dock. I bet you did not know you could get fat.
I did not know there were docks.
Hey.
Hey.
Aww, is it broken?
No, I have to wear this thing for a couple of weeks.
Did you tell the doctor you jumped him up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a whole story but then Chandler sold me.
Well, I'm sorry, Joe. I did not think the doctor would buy that he had just fallen from his grip.
What is this? Fruit?
Monica is making jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never jam in our place?
Because children need new shoes.
I go to businessmen.
I am tired and fed up of being depressed for Richard.
I needed a plan, a plan to overcome my man.
What is the opposite of man?
Marmalade.
Oh Joey no!
It's very hot.
This will be just my group.

Hey, does anyone else feel bad about Ross?
Why? Do you think he's still angry with us?
Well, he's probably angry after calling him this morning to borrow his glasses.
What? My parents are not colored
Here go to Phoebe. Who else wants one of my homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Ok, I will not have one
Me neighter.
No, no, it's just a tooth of mine.
Okay I'll have one.
So, what's the problem, do you need a dentist? I have a good one
No thanks, I also have a good one. I alone, I can not see it.
See what the problem is with invisible dentists.
Why? Why can not you go to him?
Because every time I go to the dentist, someone dies.
It's so strange, because every time I go to the dentist, I look at the hygienist's blouse.
Phoebe, what? Umm ... what?!
Yes, yes, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my postman, and then my, my cowboy friend "Albino Bob".
And all these people are actually dead?
Yes, while I was in the chair!
That's why I take so much care of my teeth, you know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Phoebe, come on, you did not kill anyone, these people just died when you went to the dentist.
It is, it is, it is only ah, a coincidence.
Well, tell them. Oh! You can not, their dead.

Hello?
Ross.
Emily, bye! Uh, how are you flying?
It was terrible. I felt guilty about how I behaved when you said those wonderful things.
No, no, that ... that's okay. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
Ross, there's something I have to tell you, here ... there's someone else.
Does it mean the same thing in England as in America?

You know what? I will not be able to enjoy this.
Yes, I know, it's my birthday. We should all be here.
So let's go.
Well, maybe, you know, maybe we should be for a song.
Yes, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
You know, the boys are probably having fun.

Ok, I have three of my five.
Three of your five, what?
Celebrities with whom I can sleep.
My God! You're giving a lot of thought to this.
Yes, it's difficult, I have only two points left.
All right, so who did you limit yourself to?
Ok, Elizabeth Hurely ....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
Eh, you know what, she's politics, she probably would not let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
IS!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But you know, she's too international, you know there will never be.
So?
So, you have to play the odds, choose someone who will be in the country as always.
Yes, because that's why you will not get Isabella Rosselini, geography.

Oh, it's five Ross. Five women have had five children! And I did not have any children! Why do not you want to come out?
Do you know what I think it is?
I think you've made such a nice home for her in the last nine months that she does not want to leave.
Oh. See how disgusting you are for me. Oh God!
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
Doctor you have to do something! I think you have to give me drugs or you have to light a fire up there and just smoke.
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters, you are about to become a mother.
My God. All right. Ha-ha-ha beat you! Sucker!

Am I still here?
No, honey, I'm not, but do not worry, because we'll find them, and until we do, we're all here for you, okay?
Ok.
Hello.
Can I see your boarding pass?
Oh no, no, I do not have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not authorized on the airway unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but I ... went ahead.
It's right there, it's got a blue jacket, I ... I can only ...
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, okay, OK, um ... then could you please, uh ... give him a message for me? Please? This is
Alright. What is the message?
Uh ... I do not know.
Lord? Lord? Excuse me, sir? Uh ... I have a message for you.
What?
It comes from Rachel. He said he loved the present and will see you when you return.
: Toby ... Oh, for God's sake, I do not know what you're talking about!
There is no Rachel!
Do not give me that freezing.

Here's the thing, Janice.
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
They are like bing, bing, bing.
You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ouch!
Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
Ow. Um, it's just my goal. It's just my goal. I will be right back.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break in the history of the world.
My God. How many of those did you have?
Oh, I do not know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la
I'm fine.
All right.
I am not well. Here it comes.
Wait here. To breathe.
How do you do it?
It's like a gift.
We should always break up together.
Oh, I'd like to.

You won.
Well, what's wrong?
It does not matter because nothing beats the three and six.
That my friend is D-Cup.
Ok, now you've won so far?
Uh, wow, 700.
Not exactly exactly?
Yes.
Doubles!
What?
Well, you see in Cups, when you get $ 700, you have to double it.
Really?
Hey, I did not take the rules.
Now, after receiving the doubling bonus, you get a card.
Now that card could be worth $ 100 bringing the total to 1,500.
Do not get excited because it will not happen if you do not get-No way!

I am, I'm sorry you could not go to the Spacecamp, and I hope that maybe somehow, this can make up for it.
Presenting the very special private Spacecamp by Sarah Tuttle!
!
Really Mr. Geller, you do not have to do it.
Oh come on! Here we are! Get ready for the mission countdown!
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Oh no! An asteroid!

Hey.
Hey.
Where are you going?
At the bank.
Sperm or normal?
Semen.
So you're really doing it, eh?
Oh yes, I chose a boy, 37135.
Sounds good.
'So bad. Brown hair, green eyes ...
No kidding, hmm.
What?

What's wrong, sweetheart?
Nothing nothing.
Aaaah, what's wrong, come on.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.
They are my friends
They have a problem with you.
In this, they do not.
Oh. They do not.
But they do not see all the wonder I see.
They do not see all good things and all sweet things.
They just think you're a little ...
What?
Intense and creepy.

Hello.
Hello.
Yes! You do not like Kathy.
You have me.
Yes, you've avoided it since we started going out. Look, I did a
Yes. Right.
Good, and hey! My treatment But it's just because you're not eating anything, right?
All right.

I can not believe we're here.
Oh, are you kidding me?
What?
As a wedding present for you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
No!! You fucked us all day!
Who are you?
We are only ten seconds later!
Yes!
You already have the first class tickets; you have the living room!
I mean, we should get things for free too!
I mean you're not the only honeymooner!
Well, you can have the suite if you want.
We do not care where we are.
We are here to celebrate our love together.
We do not have to get things for free.
We want to be together.
We need stuff.

Yup!
Ok, well then how about a handshake?
Oh God, I'm sorry!
Oh God, I'm sorry!
I did not want to touch it ... I mean

Hey, Phoebe!
Hey!
Check it out. How much are a man?!
Wow! Beautiful! Manly is also a kind of slut.
You are turning into a woman.
which brings us, of course, to Greely's theory of domination.
Ok, that's all for today.
Oh, does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Yes, it's the new building on Avenue A.
What?! That - it's all the way to cross the city, I should teach a university seminar there in ten minutes.
Ooh, friend. Not gonna happen.
Move it! Move it! Move it !! Hey !!! I'm the teacher !!

Jason?
Yes, come inside
So Phoebe, you, ah, sounded a bit serious on the phone, it's ah, is there something wrong?
No. And I do not think I'll want it.
I can not do that
Yes. Yes, this is what I did not want to know.
Well, Mark, I'm doing it for the wrong reasons, you know?
I'm just doing it to get back to Ross.
I'm sorry, it's not very right for you.
Ahh!
Fair, schmair!
You know?
Look, if you want to go back to Ross, I'm here for you.
Really?
No-no, I say-I say, let's get back to him right on this couch.
Right here!
Oh God. I'm sorry for this.
All right.
Are you sure?
Yes. I can only go home and get it back on my own.

Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Oh Joey, I'm barely there
My little sister Dina!
And here we go
I saw this movie once where there was a door and nobody knew what was behind it, and when they finally opened it, millions and millions of insects came out and feasted on human flesh.
You know, it would not kill you to respect your wife's privacy!
Stupid closet full of insects!
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I non-Whoa !!
Oh hey whoa-whoa, do not worry.
All right.
When my sisters were pregnant, they had every strange feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Really?
Absolutely.
All right. Oh God-Ow! -O!
Ok Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything will be fine, trust me.
All right.
Take my hand.
Here we are.
Ow crushing the bones!

Oh hello.
Oh, you are. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson, it's Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. Surely we have seen each other a lot lately.
We have. Maybe we'll see each other for dinner tomorrow evening, say around 8?
Well, maybe we will do it. Oh!

Well, it's not something that a girl wants to hear.
No, do not start. Ouch!
What?
There are stupid balls.
Oh good. Probably it would have been the most constructive solution.
You have the plaster on your face.
Eh?
Oh, Ross, you're right, I do not know why I always thought it was real grass.
Hey, are you okay?
My wife is a lesbian.
Cold!!
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Hello.

Hey! Where are you heading in those pants? 1982?
Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they sold those designer tiles.
If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Anything. It's just old and dirty, that's all.
I strongly doubt it.
Oh yeah. If you move the basket, see what color the card was. Yes.
I can not live like this! What we will do? What we will do?
Relax. Here you keep this. This old stuff arrives immediately.
It's a little more than I wanted to see.
Aw!
Look at him, every inch of this stuff is glued.
It would take an eternity to leverage this.
You should ah, you should leave it.
I can not leave it! You dug a hole in my shabby floor.
Eh! Here it is.
You know it's nice, you know we could put it back there after the surgeons removed it from the colon!

Hello.
Hello!
Hey!
Uh, Phoebe, speaking of your mother ...
Yes?
How are you?
So fantastic. Oh, today we took a nap and my mom fell asleep on my stomach and purrs.
It's so sweet. I'm going to have a coffee.
Eh? What did you say Joe? I will be there.
Phoebe ...
I feel like that, uhh .....
All right!!
I'm coming already !!
Gee!
Really?! Do you think it will work?
Absolutely! And if not, can I get the extra ticket?
What the hell is that?

Hello.
Hey, Phoebe! It's Joey!
Hey, Joey!
Hey!
Ooh!
Ooh!
I'm just saying someone on ... it looks just like you on the subway.
And I was going to say 'hi!' but then I thought, he does not care if it looks like you.
It only cost me four dollars. But listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are?
Oh, they are having a
A little, but I enjoyed it too much.
So you're still not nostalgic?
No, I do not think so.
All right, all seven are missing.
No.
You will see.
Liam, do me a favor. Tell the kids to go slowly with Ross, it's his first time.
You do not say!
Good luck, baby.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Enter here! Ross! Come on!
Ross, let's go! Enter the damn melee! Ross, come in!
JOEY !!!!!!

I do not think you spent my marriage fund in the beach house!
Sorry, honey, but we thought if you were married after the age of 30, you would have paid yourself.
Come on! Admit it! This was the best nap you've ever had!
I had better.
All right! When?!
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Uh Huh!
I said it! All right?! But it's over Joey!
I want to do it again.
We
Why not?
Because it's strange!
Well! Would you like something to drink?
Sure, what's wrong?
Hot milk e

Are you OK?
I need some milk.
Ok, I have some milk Here you go ... Oh! Better?
No...
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one who hit!
Phoebe, if I had never met him, it would never have happened!
I'm so sorry! No, I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry for?
I do not know ... of course, it's the pig!
This pig!
Oh, God, it's such a pig,
Oh it's like a ...
It's like a big disgusting ...
...as a...
... pig ... pig man!
Yes good! Ok ...
Oh, but he was my pig ... how did I not see him?
Oh! I know! It's because ... it's beautiful, it's fascinating and when it looks at you ...
Ok, Ok, Phoebe ...
The end.
Oh God...
Should not I tell you?
No, no, trust me, it is, it is, it is much better that I know it.
Uh, I loved it before it was better ...

Well, yes, it's kind, an unusual house.
It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, without bathrooms.
But you know, the ocean is right there.
Knock, knock, knock.
Ah, oh, wait a second. Enter, enter. All right, so think about it and call me back.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Oh yes.
Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best daughter friend!
Are you Erwin's daughter ?!
No, I ... I mean your ... your old best friend here. Lily, from superiors. Remember?
Oh God, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I ... So you must be?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yes. He called me after you, I think.
Uh Huh. Wow! Well, look! There is Frank.

Friend, you have to turn on
Let's go look at it from you.
No, Monica is watching a cooking program. Come on, I do not want to lose myself when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, do you know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable come out?
No, this is
Joey, why is your cable out?
I, oh! Because, uh, I did not really pay the bill
If you need money, please, please, let me lend you some money?
No, Chandler.
Listen, forget it, ok?
Listen, I know things have been a little tight since Janine came out.
Oh, it was hot.
Whoa I have.
I know!
Yes, but, look, I can do it.
All right?
Listen, I can listen to the radio, eh?
And Ross gave me this great book (shows the
All right, do you want to see if the joker thief will allow us to watch the show in its place?
Sure.
Did you pay the phone bill?
Not so much.

Oh well, ok, I can not take it anymore.
I can not handle it anymore
So you win, ok?
Here!
Phoebe?
Fly a plane?
Better to make it a spaceship so you can go back to yours

Hi everyone, Phoebe is here!
Phoebe!
Hey, Phoebe!
Phoebe, woo!
What?! What is the use of someone?
Well, it helps the bee to look tough in front of his friends of the bees. The bee is happy and I absolutely am not.
Now, you know, the bee probably died after she pointed at you.
Aw, damn it!

Hey, excuse me, would you mind changing with me?
Hey, no, I'm in the man of the shots.

We are at 3, 2,
Welcome back to our autumn telethon. Now, if you enjoyed the performance of

Yes.
Well, you know what?
I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask you about this.
Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Yes. Yes, that's what you need a good pill.

What are you writing?
Well, Joshua will arrive tomorrow and since I do not have the courage to ask him out, I'll sell him a coat and put this note in his pocket.
Oh yeah? Joshua, call me sooner or later, guys like you never go out of fashion ... what have you thrown away?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey, what did you guys do too?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian door handles and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Without me?!
My uncle dragged us there. But in reality it was really interesting.
Yes.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean, look!

I'm just saying, if I see another image of Ed Begley, Jr. in that
I can not believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Excuse me, please? I'm trying to have an appointment here.
Well, stop thinking about me.
I can not do it, can you?
So I'm thinking of you. So?
I do not understand what you see in this guy, anyway?
Well ... he happens to be a very nice guy ...
I mean, come on, buddy, get one
Rachel, let's go. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too difficult.
No, no, no ... why, why could it become strange for everyone else?
Who cares about them.
This concerns us.
Look, I - I've been in love with you since, like, ninth.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
I know.
If we broke up and lost you ...
Oh God.

Hello? No, he can not come to the phone right now. Oh no, no problem Ok, bye bye
Was it my job? They were crazy? Was it Jack? He screamed ?!
J-j-relax, no one screamed. Jack was just calling to be sure
Thanks God.
Yes, she was fired.

... DUMB, DRUNKEN, BIT !!! Thank you thank you.
Hey, here's a question; where did you get the most beautiful oak east of the Mississippi?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the most beautiful lace in the whole earth.
I'm reading your ad.
It looks good, eh?
Yes.
Stunning entertainment center. Beautiful and refined Italian manufactories.
Oh my God, do you guys sell the entertainment center?
Why? I love that thing
You want?
Oh no
Ah, Gepeto, $ 5,000? You are crazy?
Hey, advertising alone costs $ 300!
All right, I change it to $ 50, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is it ?! And you define yourself an accountant.
Nooo.
Oh. What are you doing?

That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment!
And you can see me!
Like yesterday, like the day before.
Are you still doing your shark attack?
No. Op, wait! There he is.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword puzzle before going to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.
Yes, I think it's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots here for you later. Hey, how about brown?
Yes, you're so smart!
Aww, you're so cute!
I know.
All right, see you tomorrow morning.
All right.

Hello?
What's with her?
I do not know.
But hey, I know we can decide.
Ok, I'll ask you some questions and you'll answer quickly.
All right?
All right.
What do you like most about action or comedy?
Action.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Friend, you're sick.
Oh sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.

I mean, this is incredible.
I know. This is really, really huge.
No it is not. Is small. It's tiny. It's minute. It's small.
Nuh-uh. I do not think any of our lives will ever be the same again.
OK, is there a silent button on this woman?
More than jewelry.

Hello! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have some routine questions that I need to ask you.
Really? I had something to do with Dr. Wells.
I know, but I'm a neurologist.
And to be safe, Dr. Wells wanted a more complete overview of your state, so she sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman.
That was a test. Successful. All right, full name.
Clifford Burnett.
Date of birth?
November 16th
Age?
Can not understand it based on my date of birth?
I'm a Doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
I'm 33.
All right. And you're married.
No.
Oh really? So, 33 years old and still single, would you say that you have problems of commitment?
Are all the questions personal?
Yup.
Well, if you need to know I'm a widower.
Oh, it's terrible I'm really sorry.
Yes.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and you never call them again?
No.
Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance, did you?

Hey! Guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Phoebe, it's great!
Oh, yay!
But you know, Rachel does not rhyme with draddle.
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Many things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Prison. Bail. Able to. May-pole.
All right, thank you. Do you have a nickname as a nickname easier to rhyme?
Did not your father call you Pumpkin?

All right.
All right, I can do it.
I can tell you how I feel.
Just, stand up straight.
Take a couple of deep breaths.
Look confident.
Joey? What happens?
I came only because I ... I want to talk to you about something.
Ok, what's up?
What I do is manage to create an atmosphere of support for the people who work with me.
I see. By the way, nice step forward on doing what to do.
The hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
You have to go!
Oh!
OK Do not worry. Are you ready.
Really?
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
All right.

Now, Mom, everything is going well, really.
Yes, Ross is fantastic.
He is in another place.
No, he's gone.
No no, you do not have to go back, really.
What do you mean this could be your only chance?
Would you stop me?
I'm only 26, I'm not thinking about children yet.
Where have you been?
Oh, I just had a baby.
Mazel tov!

Oh, wow! I should go. I had an appointment tonight.
Oh yeah! With whom?
Do you know that girl I told you about who lives in Poughkeepsie?
Yes.
Not her.
Yes, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can not decide between them.
You know, the one in Poughkeepsie, even if it's a two-hour train ride, it's really cute, very smart and a lot of fun.
But this other girl, well, lives well in uptown.
You know, she's, well, she's so pretty, I suppose she's smart, she is
If it's not fun, why do you want to go out with her?
Well, I - I want to give you another chance, you know?
She lives so close.
And at the end of the day, the other time, she - he said something that was - if he was joking, it was a lot of fun.
On the other hand, if he was not joking, it's not funny, it's stupid and a kind of racist.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey friend!
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day at the restaurant?
Damn!

Oh here's a lot of things.
Oh, I mean it will be at the wedding waiting for it and people will be whispering "Oh, that poor girl".
You know?
Then you will have to come back here and live all alone.
My God!
What?
There has been a pregnancy test in the trash, and it is positive. Monica is pregnant. So I guess it will not be completely alone.

Hello.
Listen, I'm sorry for that thing with Roger.
It was not right, and I, and I want to invent everything, so I brought you something that I think you really like.
Now this is just a loan.
All right?
I will do it, I want it back.
So now I'm going.
I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can not!

Hey!
Hey!
Hello!
All right, well, why do not I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor ?!
Hey, you want to do Joey a favor, maybe go out with Joey.

Well, sir, here's what we'll do.
I-I want to be with her, I like her.
Oh alright! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Come on! You would like to be careful, I could wake up at any time!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to get Rachel.
No-no-no, that's not Joshua.
What do you want from me, I've never met the boy.
Anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can not stay, but the rest of us have a

How do I look?
Oh, I ... I do not ... it matters to me.
Ok, now, remember, no exchange.
You have the beauty, I have the mess.
Hi, Joey. Well, look what you brought. Very beautiful.
... And what did you bring?
He is checking the coats.
Joey, I'm going to wash the smell from my hands.
You'll get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
My God.
Hey, I'm Janice.

Well, okay, I have not solved everything yet. Do not say anything to Rachel, please?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows something about this, it makes me feel special. All right!
Ok, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Hey, Rachel!
What was that?!
Sorry, mix. Hey, how was the movie?
I have not seen it yet!
Well, then you'd better hurry up! The Angelica! Leave! Leave!
Noooooooo !!

Phoebe! Hey, Phoebe!
Uh, ok, Phoebe?
Yes?
Umm, do you know how the other day you were talking about how you could not go to London and how you felt excluded?
Yes?
All right, well, we felt really bad, so we decided we should have a little trip together!
Ohh, it's so beautiful! How beautiful! Good, where? Where is the journey?
Well, we thought we would all go for a picnic in Central Park!
Yes, all of us! All day!
This sucks!
It is not a journey!
I just came back from the park!
What do we have at five in the stupid Central Park?
"Well, it's right at my house, all right!"
Well, I go home and bask in the triumph of my idea of ​​Central Park.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa !!
I've got a second, Mr. Kissey!
You know, I was going to talk to you about all this new, little, European thing that happened to you, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I-you-just-stop it!
I was just trying to bring some culture into the group.
All right, do not take it in my mouth.
It makes me want to throw up!

Are you in there?
Yes. She's putting her down now, it's her.
Oh, everything's fine.
I suppose I've just finished with the whole story of dating.
It is another thing in my life that is suddenly completely different.
This is difficult.
Yes I know.
On the other hand, in about seven months you'll have something you'll love more than any guy you've ever been out with.
Wait up.
Wait till ahh, wait the first time your child grabs your finger.
You have no idea.
Thanks sweety.
Do you want to have a coffee?
Oh no, I think I'll come home and eat ten chocolate bars.
Hey, I thought I had cheered you up.
Oh, you have it, there are twenty in here.
Right. Good night.
Good night.

Hello
Hello! Hello Mom.
This is a big party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearl of wisdom?
Jack?
Why should you serve food on such a sharp stick?
This is a good question, dad. This is a good question
Hmmm.
Congratulations to you two!
Thanks, we are so excited
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Wha-what?
Look at this clown!
Just because he has a bigger boat, he thinks he can take the whole river.
Get out of the way!
Who appoints their boat coastguard anyway?
what
What are they doing here? The coast is over there.
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! This is incredible! Joey held her breath for almost four minutes!
Guy! What are you trying to kill me ?!

Ouch!
Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It has rooms, walls and ceilings.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
My God! My God!
Ah well, this is the living room.
Impressive.
All right. This is the kitchen.
Oh, it's really cute. Wait a minute, can not I see the bedroom?
Bedroom. Well, it's practically your typical bedroom ...
We are still on this side of the door.
Um-hmm.
Yes, but I could not see it.
Oh, shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for the nice evening.
So, who was she?
Oh, that was the blind date I was talking to you, called her and passed it to today.
Did you like it? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I'm completely comfortable with this.
Well, you look good.
Well, I do not think this, you know.
No, no, no, I would not do it myself, I mean it would be weird.
Yes, no, I'll take one of the other girls to do it.
Oh, it will be so fun!
Hey!
You're excited?
Yes! Hey, are Monica and Rachel working there?

Ok, now we need sage branches and sacramental wine.
All I have is, is oregano and a
Um, it's okay! Ok. All right. Now we need the seed of a just man.
Okay, Phoebe, you know what, if we did, we would not do the ritual in the first place.
Can we start throwing things?
Ok, yes, ok. Oh alright.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxers.
Ok, and I have a receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Hey, wear a sweater.
No.
Eww!
And here we have Paulo's latest grappa.
Hey, Rachel, it's not almost pure stuff ...

Mona? Ok, if I was a salmon shirt, where would I be?
I'm so sorry to have poured wine on the whole shirt.
Oh alright.
No, it's still wet.
You know what?
Let me go out before the sunsets.
Ooh, I have something you can wear.
Here.
Oh umm, I-I do not know if I want to wear a women's shirt.
No-no that's a man's shirt.
It's terribly pink.

Oh, it's perfect!
And you?
It is a kitchen bathroom.
All right, I see what you're saying. I go, I go downstairs and fill out a question.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! Do you think we could have a bathtub in our kitchen?

Hey!
Let's go see the show!
Ok, just let me have a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's so close.
Closer from here?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Ok, let's go on skedaddle.
Wait, I will not just drink someone's old coffee.
Ok, your height.
Um, Rachel, I'm really sorry. All right, do you want to go back together? Yes, OK. Has anyone else heard it ?!

So how did you know I was here?
Your mother called me. So is she?
No, this is a borrower.
I'm sorry you had to do it alone.
I was not alone. I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper. So, did you see who won the game?
Yes, the Knicks of 10. They suck.
Yes, I'm not so bad.

I'm sorry I will not be able to do it at your imaginary wedding, but I am
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I did not want him to start shouting at me like I was a Latour of '74.
It is Lafite. The Latour of '74 is actually drinking very well.
All right, come here. I'll do it, I'll tell him, I'll be strong.
I just called a friend of mine.
Yes?
I think I can be able to book
Really?!
What is sweetness?
There will not be a marriage. Ross and I do not get married.
What?!
I'm sorry, dad.
I do not believe it !!
Oh, dad, stay calm. Please.
Keep calm?!!
How do you expect me to stay calm?
This is unacceptable Rachel!
And I want to know why? !!
Is it because that punk Ross will not marry you ?!
That's all!
Is that so?
!
Yes. Yes, he says they are damaged goods.

So you're like a zillionaire?
And you have our age. You are our age.
You know what, you should, you should buy a state and then call it only after yourself.
What does Pete Dakota like?
Yes, o, o, o, Mississ-Pete.
Oh, oh, I understand! Pete-Chicago.
That is not a state of Joe.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
I have to go, so ah, I'll see you later.
All right.
You have our age!
So, let's go for tomorrow?
Absolutely!
Now get out of here !!
Ok, I'm finishing the places I can touch it!
Look, is there something wrong with me?
I mean why I'm only attracted to kids where there is no future?
Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's a zip too!
I mean, seriously, there seems to be something wrong with me?
!
No.
Ok, I'm going to get Frank.
So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and say, "Hey, let's go visit Totally Nudees," remember?
And then, and then, you turn to me and say 'Nah, let's go stay with you.' Well, it was a nice stupid move.

Yes, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, remember the blades of the roll?
Do you know what else I will miss?
"I'm Monica.
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
Even if there are people! "
"Hi, I'm Rachel, my sweater is too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and make it smaller!"
"I'm Monica, I do not get phone messages from interesting people.
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
"Oh my God, I can not find a boyfriend!
So I guess I'll run into the corridor and sleep with the first one I find in there! "
Yes, we should go on if we want to make those dinner reservations.

Article J437-A, color: winterberry.
Hi, listen, come here, come in.
I'm so sorry yesterday.
I'm really sorry.
It's just me
Listen to Ross, you do not have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
You do?
Yes, you still have feelings for me.
And, to be honest, I - I still have feelings for you.
And I wish we could solve Ross, but we can not.
It's too complicated with you, Rachel and the baby, I-I just did not want to be.
Oh God, you're right.
Ross, we must be strong. Ok, I - I'm going. I can? To remind you?
No.

I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbalist.
Thanks, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I do not want to make it tasty.
You know when the girls sleep with guys with strange things on their body, they talk to their friends.
Give me this
Hello! Ok, do not be angry with me, but I could not resist.
Brides magazines?
Yes, and I know you would say no if you asked, but I'm sorry; how nice it would be to walk down the corridor in this Donna Carin.
Oh, you would do it too! Oh, you should do it anyway. As for clubbing.
It's so strange, I know what I said, but this morning, I was lying on the bed, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
I know it's a bit sudden, and it's a bit rushed, and it's not like I do such a thing at all, but that does not mean it can not.
Right?
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete, and I know we want the same things, and when I thought I'd say yes, I was really happy.
My God.
I know. I need more cake.
Hey, um, if you get married, can I bring two guests?
Did not you break up with that fireman?
No, that was my way of telling you.
Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, keeps a diary and paints.
He also showed me the charcoal drawings he drew on me.
Wow!
Yes, well, he would prefer water colors, but you know, he has easy access to a lot of coal.
So, are you going to download Jason?
Well, yes, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay, so Jason is sensitive, but now it's like that too Vince Plus, Vince has the body you know?
So it's really just for math.

Ok, so it's still a draw, 41 to 41.
Ok, look! Now stop!
No, I just have to have two more points to beat it!
Monica, this was true too
I can not just leave! I put in four hours!
But...
Look!
You knew about me when you married me!
You agreed to take me sick and healthy.
Well, this is my sickness!
Oh yes, yes, lobster.
Yes, I mean I got sick all night.
Yes, me too, all night.
Really?! Why did not we cross?
Yes, well, because I stayed in my room. Yes, you do not want to look in my trash.

I can not believe there's a naked prostitute in there!
Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a prostitute
Yes, ok let's leave these two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I'm not going to do it with a random guy!
Well! Then you tell Roger why he could not wait to do it!

So.
So.
I just thought we two should be around.
I mean, you know, we never really talked.
I guess you'd know, being one of us, right?
I know, I probably should not even tell you, but I'm pretty much intimidated by you.
Really? Myself?
Yup.
Oh my God, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and I'm probably totally paranoid, but I have the feeling that maybe you do not.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Um, ok, oh, oh god, when you and uh Ross started coming out, it was really hard for me, for many reasons, that I will not bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy, you know, and how good you are, guys, and, er, Monica always says you're kind, and God hate him when he's right.
Thank you. Hey, look, would you like to go see a movie sooner or later?
Yes that would be great. I would like.
I would like that too. Shoot, I have to go. So, I'll talk to you later.
All right, Julie.
Hello.
Hello. What a manipulative whore.

Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's nice, but I'm going with the one I picked first.
Oh my God Chandler, what you chose is gone. It's over!
What?
Some guys bought it. I'm sorry. I'm tired of stopping him but they put me in jail!
Did they put you in jail?
The small prison between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to watch the ring!
I know I'm sorry! But you know, this ring is better! Monica has never seen the other ring.
Yes, but when he proposed me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe he was the boy.
It was the ring!

No, not that, I mean, and you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I will ... I will interrupt with her.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, do not do it. No, I do not mean for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adaptation.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's leave this weekend
Oh, Barry ..! Come on, this is all too ..
We can, we can go to Aruba!
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was ... it was really nice.
You would like it.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right, Miss Green, everything looks fine ... Yes, I think we are starting to see real progress here.
What?!
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.

My God! What does he do
Oh this is an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm out of here!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Hey!
So they were made then!
Almost! But first, we must start.
All right.
This is a test for glaucoma.
Uh Huh.
Sit down.
All right.
But your chin here. Now you will feel a small breath of air in every eye.
What?!
A little puff of air, now come on!
Of course, now I'm scared.
No, we can go together! Do not wait too long, ok? Because I'm out of here a little bit before Friday.
Yes, but I do not want to die!
No-no, it will be fun! We can come back and we can torment these guys!

Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Oh hey.
Hello.
Hey.
You have the lipstick here. All right, it's mine, we just kissed.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey Hey Hey. So, what happened? Does a forest turn you off?
No. You know how we always say we need a post office.
Yes!
Well, I started to build one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Are you building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubicle built right inside. It's a day's work, max.
All right. My word! Those are comfortable.
Oh yeah. These are my old work trousers, those of Sergio Valente.
The electric saw left me away from me.

Hello!
Another cheesecake has arrived! They handed it back to the wrong address!
So bring it down, what's the problem?
I can not say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, did we eat a whole cheesecake two days ago and still want it?
Well, I forgot what it looks like, ok ?!
It was a cheesecake.
It was fine
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a filling of creamy cheese very rich but light Wow!
My whole mouth was filled with saliva!
You know what? Forget about it!
Yes, and we'll let him downstairs in order not to be tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go for lunch?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

This is from me.
Ahh!
It was not on your list, but I hope you think it's really funny.
A scooter!
Follow the list. Always follow the list
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Ok, open the next one. Open our neighbor!
All right.
Now that you're a couple, do not we get two presents from you guys?
For my last birthday you gave me a
All right.
Happy Birthday Grandma!
It is better to be above the hill and then bury it below.
All our love, Monica and Chandler.
It's funny, yes!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
I do not know! I see! It is funny!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No, I know, because to be a grandma you have to be married and have children and I do not have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.
All you had to do was buy the card!

Hey, Joey. What is going on?
Clear tracks for the express boobie payback. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Joey !! What the hell were you doing ?!
Sorry. Wrong mistakes.
Hi, Joey.
Oh! ...Hi dear.

Man. Can you believe he had sex with only one woman?
I think it's great. You know, it's sweet, it's romantic ...
Really?
No, are you kidding? The boy is a monster ..
Hello Friend.
Hello.
Oh, it's attractive.
Oh, I thought you were fantastic in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All in all, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me in particular, which part was the fun part? Where is my record?
Oh, ah, the boy has it.
The child...? Excuse me, um, that's my record.
You must do it, friend.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever - you can not do it. Listen, my record rests.
"Yes", what do you say? C'mere. Give me!
Hey! Hey! No hold in my ER!
GIVE ME MY PUCK !!
...Now
Oh, look, I wish good luck!
For what?
I'm going to get one of those jobs.

Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Okay, right?
Did you order a stripper for a shower? This is totally inappropriate!
What? It will be dressed as a child! Oh hello Mrs Green!
Hello!
I'm so happy you can do it.
Yes, thank you very much. And again, we are so sorry. We could not feel worse.
Try out. There's my baby.
She is still angry.
Yes I know. Is not it fantastic? One less person we have to talk to small.
Phoebe, Sandra is angry with you too. Does not it bother you?
Oh, it's very-really very-very good.
Julie's cervix is ​​seven centimeters wide, that is, about four fingers. The doctor makes me feel alone.
Did you hear Rachel Ross's cervix?
No, I do not think we'll do it.
We will not do it.
Well, if you like it you can hear Rachel and then hear mine to compare.
Am I interrupting?
Oh yeah! Thank you.
Oh. Oh wait no.
After.
No-no-no! Do not leave me here with these people.
Oh sorry.
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My son has no father!

Try to feed her again.
I've already fed it.
I know, that's why I said again!
All right, guys, we can not light each other, all right? It's just what he wants.
Hey.

Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you might need me with such short notice! Oh.
Oh Monica, we're so sorry.
For what?
Well, first of all, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
And then to forget to invite you to it.
You already did it?
Yes.
Well, we called everyone in your address book and a lot of people came, but it took a long time to get you here that they - they had to leave.
Yes, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a nice shower, and now you do not even have one.
We ruined everything.
Ugh
Well no, wait a minute, it's not true!
No, what it was, it was really sweet.
And it works a little for the best.
What do you want, what do you mean?
Well, now I can take a shower with the only people I really love!
I mean, I take all those presents without having to talk to people I do not even like!
Surprise
Sur-surprise.
Monica.

I can not believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair !!!
Well, on the positive side, now you will not have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts.
Not you guys.
Did you understand!
So, what do we do today?
They have a downstairs game room! Ping pong and stuff.
Table tennis? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
I do not think so!
Why not?
Because you know how competitive you are and you're worth it, I say it's cute, others do not agree, and I'm lying!
I'm not always that bad!
Oh,
Did I punch you ...?
IS...?
... Phoebe ...?
... is...?
I have clunked your heads together!

I'm sorry, ah, I scared you in there.
Oh alright. By the way, I was just checking the shower masseur.
Yes.
Hey!
I tried to contact you at work. There was ... a fire.
What?! Oh my ... Oh my God !! What happened?!
Well, we believe he was born here. In the aroma room.
All right. They all came out well?
Well, the giraffe is fine. And so is the pirate.
Ohh. What is this?
No Phoebe, do not look! You do not want to see what's underneath !!
Ohh, I-the foster puppets!

Hey.
Hey! How long will it last until the battle of Pete?
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they are interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains going to Iran and snatching his arms from thieves.
Hot dog?
Four, please. I'm very nervous. Thanks.
So Ross, how, umm, how was it with Bonnie?
What?
Oh!
I have to tell you, I-I did not expect to like it at all, I mean I did not really expect to please someone right now, but it's really fantastic.
Ohh, it's too bad!
No, I'm saying I liked it.
Yes, you know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Phoebe, I think it's fantastic. All right? We will go out again.
Ok, I hear you! Are you able to talk about something else?
Hey! What is my turkey burger?
Ah, the one near my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fight is starting!
Ok, we'll go right away. So, your boss tried to slap you again today?
Nine times!
Ok, I had to put the lotion!
But everything will be fine, because from tomorrow I am conducting an experiment, and if everything goes as planned, my ass will be free.
The fight is over!

Ok, ok, here it comes! How do I look? Do I look like a boy who does not want to get married?
Yes! And also, a bit like a French boy. I've never noticed it before.
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Oh, just come out, talking about uh, websites.
Yes, we've seen this really interesting website about marriage and how utterly useless it is and how it's just a way for the government to keep an eye on you.
Yes, Big Brother.
Well, he's a little crazy. Even though I'm happy to know that you're expanding on what you watch on the Internet.
Yeah, well, you know, it just made me think, why would anyone want to get married, huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To consolidate your commitment! To declare your mutual love to the world!
huh
All right, it's nice to know.
Mr. Bowmont is here !!!

Oh, it's great, my friend Joey is in the movie business.
Do you know who I met from school? Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently the assembly of Howie now.
Yes, he-he-he calls me and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
Can you believe it ?!
You know, I - I - I have not talked to him for ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yes, I always hated that Howie.
No, no "How are you?" Friend, I mean not even a cup of coffee before!
The nerve eh?
Yes!
Reload?

Hey! How are you?
Good! Well, we do not see each other for a long time.
Yes.
Like your sweater.
Oh hey, right to you.
Oh, it's crazy for Rachel, huh?
Yes. She-Well, are you mad lady?
So whose is it?
Umm, I'm not an Italian boy. Come on, read your label. See you later.
All right.
He is so strange.

Do you want to play with Joey?
Yes!
You know, since I had that dream about him, and I can not get it out of my head!
And what's the problem, people always do it!
Who? Who do you know who are joking friends?
Ok, on top of my head ... Don and Janet.
Who, who are they?
I know them from work.
Both of them?
No, one of them ...
Which?
I do not know, what were the names I just said?
Rachel, things can become incredibly complicated.
All right, all right, you're right
What the hell are you cooking!

My God! How did you come back here ?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hello, fireman officer, can I - can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the garbage chute.
This is not mine.
Yup.
How do you know it?
Next time you want to download a fire alarm into a trash chute, do not wrap it in a blanket that says "Phoebe Buffay's Property, not Monica".
Okay, okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Please re-attach this, it is against the law to disconnect them.
Well! But please God; tell me how to stop him from leaving!
There is a reset button under the plastic cover.
Is there a reset button?!
Ugh, thank you!
Thank you!
There is a reset button!
My God!
Because I did not see it!
Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
Oh here it is!
Oh!
Oh God!

Four letters: "Circle or circle".
Ring dammit, ring!
Thank you.
Hey, do you know that our phone does not work?
What?!
I tried to call you from the bar and I did not get an answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Just like you told her you did it! ... Just emphasize the irony.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the porter - I got the peeper's name! May I use the phone?
Nngghhh !!!!!!!
Can I use your phone? Yes, the number of a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating device".
Radiator.
Five letters.
Rdtor.
Yes, is there Sidney there? Oh, this is it? Sidney is a woman.
Well, you'll have to wait for your turn.
Well, how much do you think it will be?
Every minute now.
Hey, this ... Heyy ...

Hey.
Hey! Some good mail?
Yes, you have something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey you can open it for me, I'm a little bit.
"Expired benefits".
Hmm is strange. I do not remember being in a move called decayed benefits.
Ok, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance has expired because, last year, you did not work enough.
Let me see!
All right.
Oh, I can not believe it!
This sucks!
When I had insurance I could be hit by a bus or catch fire, you know?
And it would not matter.
Now do I have to be careful?
!
Sorry, buddy, there's never a good time to stop catching fire.
All right, I guess I have to find a job. I'm going to see my agent.
Ok, make sure you look both ways before crossing the road.
look in both directions before crossing the road.

I can not believe Phoebe has her children!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Do you know what else I can not believe?
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I came out of a room, I mean it's a pity they did not see us having sex.
Do you know something about women?
No.
Everything is alright.
All right.

Do you remember when we went to Central Park and hired the boats? .. It was fun.
Yes. He could row like a Viking.
Hello.
Mmm.
So what's up?
Oh, you know ...
Did he mention us?
He said that you really miss him.
You had a hard day, eh ...
...I love you.
Are you still wet?
Uh, wet, yes.
Let them dry again.

My God! My God!!
Are you still crying?
As a
You know, I only know two infallible ways to close a man. And one of them is sex.
What's the other?
I do not know, I've never had to use the other.
I'm just saying that if we have sex, it will not speak.
Oh this is true.
You're the talker.
Anyway, great idea!
Umm, I have to go to the store; I told him I would buy him other fabrics.
Oh, we have some
No, you do not!

OK yes. Triple A can take us.
Great!
Yes, which city are we near?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
So why are you answering? At least you know which way we are going?
Yes, we are definitely on Route 27.
All right. We're at a stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Ok, 93 or 76?
I do not know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we got here.
All right.
Hey, can you send someone up and down 76 and check every stop, and even 93?
All right!
Yes, no, they do not.
Uh, ok, well, someone will come and save us.
Who?
I mean, did you see a car come here in the last hour and a half?
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come get us.
No! No, I'm not getting into the car with Ross, we'll just have to live here!
But if...
No boys, I will not get in the car with him, you'll have to think about something else.
Oh well, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the help to go went well?
I'm telling you, I saw it.
Yes, well, you're wrong! Ok, you're wrong.
I was not wrong! I wish I had been. I'm sorry. I bet the barium enema does not sound so bad now, eh?

I know.
Let's try a look of distant wonder.
All right, we'll see our future and think about our marriage and the days ahead.
Chandler!
What's the problem with your face ?!
I want to say that this photo should say "Geller and Bing will get married", not "The local woman saves the idiot drowning!"
Hey!
Do not laugh at him!
He is
Aww!
That's all! Take it! Take it! Take it!

We will find love!
Definitely!
Yes, I'm quite confident.
This is what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
It would be nice to have a small guarantee though.
What do you mean?
Well, you know, some people do business with a friend, as if none of them were married when they're 40, they marry each other.
Do you mean a backup?
Exactly!
Yes, yes, I understood it.
You do?
HM-mmm.
Who?
Joey.
Joey?!
Yes!
Are you serious?!
Yes, I locked it years ago!
So if none of you are married when you are 40, you will marry Joey.
Yes, we got excited. Yes, but believe me that's not how he wanted to sign the deal.
Oh, seriously?
Yes, what will I do?
Yes, I'm sorry, buddy. Do you want to go see?
Yes!

Good morning.
Hi tag! Hey, so you had fun with Joh last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh, it's cute
Then we went to this bar and kidnapped us with all these women!
Wo-women? Do you mean old?
Well, a little old, like 30.
Oh.
And I had never been able to talk only with the girls in the bars, but I had 20 phone numbers last night.
Is fantastic! Wow buddy, so Joey must have really taught you something eh?
A bit.
Yes?
How are you'?

Phoebe, we're so proud of you! You're amazing!
I know.
So it really hurts like they say?
What did you just say?
Make another eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
Yup! I love you! I've never loved anyone as much as I love you.
I've never loved anyone as much as I love you.
Ok, so if an eight comes, we take it as a sign and we do it!
Whoa!
Where did I hear it before?
Matthew Perry talks about the signs in Las Vegas.
I guess it must have been a movie I saw.
What do you say?
All right!
All right! Come on! Here we go! All right!
All right! This is a four! And where ... where is the other?
He went under the table.
Nobody moves! Ok, you look like that; I will look this way!
All right!
Here it is! Here it is!
It could be a four or a five. It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.

Well, that's all. I finished. Thank god! The sweat of meat arrives.
Well, Joey, we're all very proud of you.
Yes, I think we can expect a call from the President at any moment.
Is there anything we can do for you?
No, no one presses me on my stomach.
By the way, you can keep those pants.
Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you have there? What is that? Cake?
Yes, do you want some?
Ah, cut me a little bit of splinter.
A little bigger.
Little bigger.
What?!
Are you afraid you're going to end ?!
Cut me a real piece!

Phoebe, oh my God! WH-WH-What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
My God!
Sure sure.
Umm, could you excuse me for a moment?
Umm, do you know the other cities?
Why do not you know what's going on?
Well, not much.
But I was thinking that since those guys got engaged, maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, you know?
So, could I just move with you for a couple of days?
Umm, okay, yes, of course. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing Why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yes, it is! I go to the cinema and start in five minutes.
Do you realize that I have a classroom full of students?
Oh sorry. I'm so rude. Someone wants to come to the cinema?

Look, look, there must be a way to overcome this.
Ok, I can not imagine, I can not imagine my life without you.
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
Your good heart Rach, and, and ....
No.
I can not, you're a completely different person for me now.
I thought of you as someone who would never, never hurt me, ever.
God, and now I can not stop imagining with her, I can not, no matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
It just changed, everything.
Forever.
Yes, but this can not be, I mean.
So why is it?

The windows are clean, the candles are lit.
Uh, the belt must be tight, you have to change the belt.
Did I shoot the fish?
No, because I made lasagna.
Am I out of control?
Just a touch
Lun, I do not understand.
I mean, you came out with this guy since, like ... his midterms?
I mean, because suddenly you're like that ... Oh.
What?
Could it be the night tonight?
I do not know.
Look, he's a good guy and I love being with him but ... you know.
Things happen and happen.
Do not plan these things.
So you cut your legs?
Yes.
A-ha!

Ross!
Well! I mean, Ben! Well!
Okay, Raymond, Joey, you're awake.
Hello!
Ok, well, let's try one. Whenever you are ready.
Uh Oh.
There is a problem?
Well, this is spaghetti soup and uh, I worked with tomato.
But that's okay, no problem.
No problem.
Hmm, spaghetti soup.
You know, it's ... okay, but the joke is "Hmm, soup".
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, spaghetti soup.
How is it so different? Oh! Yes!
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, spaghetti soup.
All right. Let's do it again.
All right.
Hmm, soup. I mean spaghetti soup. I mean soup!
COME ON!!!!
You know what? We have to move on.
No! No! I - I can do it again! To see? Look! Hmm, spaghetti soup. Damn!

All right. Give us only a second. Ross!
Yes?
Give it some money.
I really think they are out of the rooms.
They are not!! Ross, they're only saving them for important people !! All right?! What ... if I was the president ?!
Well, then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you do not know where they are.
All right.
Uh, you say umm Would you mind checking again to see if umm, the private rooms could have opened?
This is a hospital.
All right.
You know what?
I must say that I really do not care about your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problems ... Whoa!
Oh mom!
Whoa!
What what?
Ouch! Ouch! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Yes, it could not hurt to look.

I'm just saying that if the dogs experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven years of dog for one thing of the human year, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, it does not lose only three hours, loses like a week and a half.
It is funny. Who I am?
The blonde woman is my ex-wife and the woman who touches her is her ... intimate and personal friend.
You mean that they are lovers.
If you want to put a label on it.
Wow, uh, anything else should I know?
Oh God, Ross, I can not do it.
Ok, fast and painful.
Oh God ... Okay. Alright. Alright. All right. Ross, please do not hate me.
Oh what? What what?
Do you know Marcel?
...Yes?
Well, in a way ... I lost it.

Hi Phoebe!
Hello!
How are you?
Good.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the cafe, we decided that I would keep the cute guy's cell phone?
Yes.
And remember how I said I would keep it in my bag so that, if it sounded, could I just take it?
Yes!
And do you remember going into my bag and stealing the phone ?!
Ooh, now you've lost me.
You stole the phone!
No I did not!
No? So you're saying that if I called it, would not it sound?
No. Umm, okay. But while you call, let me show you the characteristics of my new ring bag. Oh, it works!
Phoebe!
It is not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why not um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts there?
How could I leave them in the copy room?
I do not know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? All right? It is not a perfect world! Go, please.
Beautiful.
Thank you. Hello? I still do not understand.

How are you'? Welcome. It's nice to see you!
This will be your phone.
Is fantastic. But I do not really expect many calls.
No, answer and make commitments.
But I am the guest!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You will answer the phones.
You do not seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here's your phone doctor.

Hey guys.
Hey Gunther. Hello. I mean you're going out for an appointment with the noisy kid upstairs?
Well, it's very fascinating.
I know, it's too fascinating, but if you two start going out, it will make it a lot harder to hate him.
Well, you should try.
Joey, where are i
I do not know, Chandler should pass around him ...
Ugh, close

Oh!
See what happened!
Do not make you hope guys, we can only see her from the back or from the neck up.
Its times like this make me want the nets to transmit a bit 'of nudity in addition to the seat of Denis Franz.
Hey.

All right, ten blocks lower. Five to go.
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh sorry! You need a break?
My boots in the tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer to see the price?
I can see it from here. It will cost you a husband.
Ok I'm sorry. I think I can do the rest of the journey now. Just give me my boots.
Come more!
Oh God!
Yes, you like it, right?
Oh yes right there!
Do you want it there? You take it there baby!
Uh Phoebe?
Yes, say my name. Say that! And now I will cover you again, and we will never do it again.

Happy?! Is that what I should be Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you should be!
Eh?
Because for sure I can not understand it!
I speak to you and it's nothing.
You look at me, and nothing.
Anything.
Guys, you make me fly! High! Ok, we'll take it here, tomorrow.
Well, that was ah ...

What?! What are you doing?!
Do you know what happened?
Yes. We had sex and then we fell asleep.
No. We were in the middle of sex and
Nooo! No it is not true. No, the best time ever! Yes, you've rocked my world!
Do not worry, Chandler, it's not a United States globe.
Hey guys, I'll go out and take a walk.
Phoebe, why does your bag move?
Oh, it's not!
Seriously, it's moving!
What the hell is inside?
It's just my knitting, that's all! Yup! Knitting. I'm very good

There will be a moment in each of your careers when you get the chance to cheat another soap opera actor.
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised another actor to play a role, homosexual.
Yes, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they, ah, they liked that stupid gay thing and they chose it.
And now, he has a two-year contract with Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, I am stuck here to teach a group of people, most of whom are too bad to even be on TV.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

Rachel?
I'll be out in a second.
Oh. It's so unexpected! I uh Boy will tell you that it is an honor to be nominated for one
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
in bookings at 8:00 am of Neil Simon. Thank you, thank you Neil. Thanks for the words.
Okay honey, you can finish this after we're late. We have to go.
Please do not play music. Just one more.

I can not believe you do not want to know.
I mean, I could not not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows ...
And Monica knows ...
So, heh, how could you know, I do not even know!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
So what will it be?
Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh big now knows, and I do not know!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Or an uncle ...
Hey, Phoebe!
Hi Phoebe!
Phoebe!
Well!
Phoebe, what's the problem?
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm alone, I'm out of my mind.
Oh, right, it's me!
Hey, Chandler, that place at the table closes at 7, come on.
Beautiful.
Phoebe, what is it?
All right, do you know Paolo?
I know his job, yes ...
Well, he made a move on me.
Whoa, the store will be open tomorrow!
More coffee here, please!

Hey.
Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, um, I did it, but maybe I was a little bit critical.
Yes, oh, but oh ...
Look now, Phoebe remembers, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas ....
Destiny.
Sure.
Yup.
All right.
All right. Yikes! That does not seem very satisfied.
Oh, that's it, that's one of the old ones, he's just carrying it behind him.
Keep the old ones in the back, which is so anti-age.
Well, we have to make room for fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old ones?
Well, they enter the chipper.
Why, I have a feeling that it is not as happy as it seems? No! Nooooo !!!
Hey! Hey !!

Light still out?
Yes.
Oh. Perhaps they are sleeping.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Shut up!
So, whaddya thinks George is like?
I think he is shy.
Yes?
Yes. I think you should get it out. And then, when you do, it's a preppy animal.

Hello! Hi, I'm Ross, you do not know me, but I'm your big fan. I mean,
Are not you with that girl over there?
Well, yes, a little.
Um, but all right, let's see we have an understanding, um, let's see each of us have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you.
No, no, no, it's flattery.
I'm sorry.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
Do not do it, do not fire it so fast.
I mean, this is an opportunity that happens once in a lifetime ...
Yes for you. Is that the list?
Um, yes.
I can see it?
Er, no.
Come on!
But it's fine.
I'm not on the list!
Um, look, but it's not the final draft.
It's laminated!
Yes, um, okay, you were, you were on the list but my friend Chandler raised the good point that you are international, so I met you for Wynona Rider, local.
You know, it's ironic ...
What?
... because I have a list of five stupid types of coffee and yesterday I beat you for that guy over there.
We'll be just friends.

Get out of here, you lurker! Go ahead! Get!
Hey, Phoebe!
Ohh! You invented!
Yes, I could not be angry with him for too long.
Yes, he could not live without Chan Love.
Oh, take a room.
We have one.
I know. Use it.

Oh, Monday, listen, I have to ask!
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me to his apartment, now he does it with a lot of girls?
Yes a lot. Very very!
Ohh! And I'm one of them !! Wow! Oh, I can not believe it! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, you know, it's none of my business, but you're not married?
Yeah. Oh, I just wish we could not get married for a while! You know, I just wish we could be like in a break!
Ross! I think he's trying to make something happen with you to get back to me!
So this is the only reason why it could be here eh?
It could not have anything to do with the fact that - maybe I'm a good listener and I and I put one on
Ross, I'm telling you he's using you to get back to me!
You know what?
I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Whoa!
Uh, that was your sister indeed.
She ... she thinks you're just using me.
So?

I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?!
I-I, I came to fill the trays of ice cubes.
What?!
Umm, ok, okay, look.
I took this picture from your fridge.
Ok, because I know this is my father.
Yes, this is Frank Buffay and you're right there next to him.
Now, look, I deserve to know where I come from.
All right?
So if you can help me find my father, then you should!
Otherwise, you're just bad!
So tell me the truth!
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
Is my father Chuck Magioni?
No, no, it's just Chuck Magioni, I - I sold a house last year!
And I am very sorry, but I do not know where your Father is, and this is the truth.
Oh.
But umm, you're right.
I think a person should know where they come from.
Wh-that's why I ah, ah, it's okay.
I'm your mother
Eh?
You know, I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I felt everything float, and ...

What's happening to your accent?
Are you coming again?
What is ... what is this nonsense?
All right, I-I'm not English.
I come from Long Island.
I was very nervous and the accent had just come out.
I'm sorry.
So if only we could go back to the lesson.
Umm, were there any questions?
About paleontology.
All right, look, I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I fucked.
But what you guys think of me is really important because I - I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
Ross !! You are crazy?! I'm
Well, bye Rachel!

Where are you going, Joe?
For a walk.
Oh. Do you mind if I join you?
In reality, it will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Your thoughts? Plural?
All right, all right, I just have a thought! It's about the hot nanny, I have to see her!
I'm afraid I could not afford it, Joe.
Now are you telling me that I can not see it?
Guys are killing me!
It is forbidden fruit!
It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable kid ... Why are you doing this, eh?
Ross told you not to let me go over there?
Yes, he did, so I can not let you go.
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff the great novels are made of.
Great novels?
Good ... mediocre porn

Ok, I think we can get the assessment before they see it, but we'll have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.
Now, do not enter until 10, so it's not a problem, but his assistant, Betty, comes early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
It is rather sad.
Yes, well, Betty is pretty sad. That's why I think I can lure you with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her,
Done!
Let's get inside!
Hi Rachel, do you have a minute?
Yes, of course Mr. Zelner, for you nothing-minute. All right. Beautiful. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Actually, I'd like to talk to both of you.
All right. Uh, well we can, can we bring you something Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Cassie, do you find everything okay in there?
Yes! Thank you so much for allowing me to stay here.
Oh! No problem! I
What?

You are an iron.
You're made of steel!
Let me ask you something, why do not I have to wait an hour and a half when I call your IT helpline?
I told you, we're always adding new operators. Could we focus on my training?
I mean why, among all the people would you like to go out with Chip ?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools ...
Ok, this does not help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to a place where you were popular, and you had to ride Chip's bike and put on his letterman jacket.
I went to one where I was wearing a band uniform that had to be done specifically.
Should they have done it on purpose?
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my God, they told us it was for the mascot!
So, I thought I would never, ever get a chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's ... he called me and asked me out.
And the fat girl inside me really wants to go.
I owe you this.
I never let her eat.
Oh, go out with him.
Oh really?!
Yes. Only, if possible, could you leave it somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
I'll try.

Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl you're dancing with.
Yes, yes, okay
Uh, look friend, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the New Year's countdown - I'm trying to conquer her, so I was wondering if ...
Oh, come on, you can dance with my partner, it's true, uh, sweet!
Well, I was hoping tonight maybe I could know
Ross, go over it! It's not like she hates you.
Yes but
Ross, it's not strange, he just wants his things to be unique.
Huh. Do you know what is not unique? A twin!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh, Phoebe is here! Ok, let's turn off all the lights and watch the movie!
All right. Hey-Ooh, fantastic sheets!
Oh, do you like it? Do you want to know where I got it?
Sure!
He got a flea market!
Did you buy your sheets at a flea market? Ross, come on, you have to loosen the ropes of the bag a little.

And Joey?
How do you think he's doing?
Am I the only one who does not think she's sexy? Ross?
Eh, I mean, I do not mean she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Thank you!
Now that Rachel is gone?
So hot I cried to sleep last night.

Oh, God help us.
What?
Nasty naked boy posing kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking for a favor here. If I do it for his brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on here? Go out with tons of girls.
I know, but I made a big mistake. I should never have left me. You will help me? Please?

So honey, this morning was fun, eh? Me jumping over you in the shower there.
Yes! And maybe one day we could have a place with two bathrooms.
Listen Carol umm, I was thinking, maybe, maybe we could make things a little spicier.
What do you mean?
Carol, our sex life is ... it does not work
Hey, little buddy!
Hey, uh-hey, why do not we take your shoes, eh?
Hey, why do not you show Dad how you can put your shoes in your room!
Yay!
!
Yay!
Yay!
Seriously, our sexual life I was thinking, maybe I do not know, we could try some new things.
You know?
For fun?
What kind of thing?
Well, I do not know, and if we were too tied to each other?
Umm, some people eat each other.
Nah!
Umm, you know, could we try to talk dirty?
Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
I love that idea!

Hey, Sophie!
So who was the idea of ​​putting everyone on the table on skates?
Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
Was you?!
Yes! Ok, here it is.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Oh my God, are you okay guys?
Are you OK?
Oh my.

Sit!
Hello.
Oh my God, Joshua!
All those things I said about not being ready
Are not they true?
No, they're ... they're all true.
Oh.
But
Oh! Oh, I love it but
Do you want to come in and have a coffee?
Yes.
All right. Whenever.

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you guys will not believe what I have to do for work today.
Yes, but, Ross
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just thought we could whisk them and then add peas and onions.
Why should we do it?
Well, because they'd be like my mother made them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes arrive.
Ok, bye guys. Thanks for everything. Oh sorry! Oh sorry!
The most incredible thing happened. Underdog has just left.
The ball?
No, no, the real cartoon character. Obviously the ball. It's all about the news. Right before he arrived
I can not, I have to go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog left free on the city. How many times does it happen?
Hardly ever.
Do you have the keys?
Ok.

What do you think about it?
Much things
What do you think it is?
Can I help you?
Oh no thanks, we're just here to watch.
Do not observe a dance class. you
What do you mean?
I think she means' You
Okay, are you the person you think could be me?
People! Last time there were some empty yogurt containers around after class. Do not make it happen again!
She could be you.
Let's begin. Five, six, one-five six seven eight ...
Ok, I do not understand it!
I'm absolutely taking it!
Have you ever felt like you're sometimes so incredibly uncoordinated?
What? Just click when they click.
Well folks, now everybody grabs a mate.
All right. And, my mother, dead, she says, you are. I'm with Rachel.
Great. It is again a gym class.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it's never been like that.
Nooo, it was not.
Ooh, and it's so nice to have this little sink here ...

Oh, is not it nice? It's so quiet, I could just sit here all day.
I know
Open your curtains! Open your curtains!
I'm so happy we have connecting rooms!
The sun has come out!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Ok listen, go down to the pool and book the chairs, and I'll take the magazines and the lotion.
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Nooo!
Damn!
The walls are quite thin, guys!

Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all due respect I'd like to donate some liquids.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for candidates right now.
Oh, pity. I saved a bit. Uh, are you sure there are no studies I can attend?
Well, here's a program of what's coming.
Thank you. Good, but this starts now.
Oh, that's available now, but only identical twins are allowed. It's a study of twins.
But it's $ 2,000.
Sorry.
Well, how about this? Experience the effects of Joey Tribbiani on the attractive nurse receptionist.
We have already achieved the results on this, and they are not good.

Hey! How are you'?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes he has it! I made cookies!
Oh alright. I'm still full of home-made chips.
But you should eat them now because they are hot from the oven.
All right.
Oh-oh! But not here! You can not eat them in bed, remember? No crumbs!
Ok, I'll be out in a second.
All right!
What are you doing?
This does not stop, does it?

You know, it still smells like a monkey in there.
This saves us a conversation.
Well, listen, it was great, but I'm officially canceled.
Me too, we should go.
No.
Oh. My does it.

Ok, here comes another camera.
Right. No biggie. You're loose.
Why do they keep doing it?
If we want to get in the car, I think we have to get on one of those platforms.
They're recording those people up there all day.
Right.
Hey, what did you guys do to get up there?
Oh yeah? Well, when you learned to dance, did you forget how to wear your underwear?
Yes!
Hey! You're a good dancer!
Really?
Yeah, well, you'd be better if you had a little loose hips.
What do you mean?
Like this.
Here, listen to the rhythm. That's better.
Uh Huh.
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
I do not see it. You're dancing with the tall boy over there. Tall boy, raise your hand!
No-no hey friend, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Really, have you thought? I do not..

Why are not you still at home?
Is there anyone?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm alone, I'm just looking out of your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
We took some
Oh, he brought her back to her apartment.
Who? Is that your sister?
Ugh, her
God, Ross has an appointment with your sister! How strange is it?
Oh my God, look ... look, you're taking off your clothes!
He is taking off his coat!
Oh, this is simply terrible.
Ross! Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking
You are disgusting!!
What?!
Ok, the melting is still active!

Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I understand if you came to hit me, I deserve it.
No, I do not want to hit you.
Oh what then? Kick me?
No.
My child? Rather serious. Oh hey Katie! What are you doing here?
Well, the delivery went to you and I understood that they forgot it.
Ah, it must have been pretty obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Listen, to be honest, home delivery is really part of my job description.
Oh.
Oh, I really came here to ask you out.
Oh! Wow! Uh, yes! Sounds good. I'll put it in my pocket, pretend
Sure!
Horny bitch. No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!

Chandler !! You have the best taste in men!
Good, as a father, as a son.
Patrick and I were so good last night! I mean, I think this could turn into something serious.
Really?! I-I thought you were not looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for a kind of adventure.
Well, you know, maybe. But did not you tell him? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
Did you tell this guy that I was looking for an adventure ?! You do not tell the boy!
Why not?! I would be thrilled if I had known that a sexy girl was just trying to ... oh, I see.
Oh, between the fact that you told him that I wanted to infatuation and that I had made the first date ... oh, he has such a wrong idea.

All right, so I went back to high school, I'm in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize I'm completely naked.
Oh yeah. He had that dream.
Then I look down and I realize that there is a telephone ... there.
Instead of...?
Quite right.
I never had that dream.
No.
All of a sudden, the phone starts ringing.
And they were not watching you before?
In the end, I guess I should answer,

Honey! Dinner is ready!
Tonight, what did my little chef give me?
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Yup! And much of this!
Thanks, honey. Give me some sugar here. All right.
OK let's go.
Here we are! Here we are! Here we are! How are you'?

Something did not work with Underdog and they could not make the head swell.
So, anyway, his head is like flopping on Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking ... how inappropriate it is.
I have something in my eyes, Joey, could we control it in the light, please?
My God.
What?
Hello! We were at the same table? It's like ... cocktails in Appalachia.
Come on, they're close.
Close? She has the tongue in her ears.
Oh, like I've never had a little turbulent with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's not true, is it?
Well, who has to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my God, what were you thinking?
All right, look, I'm not proud of it, okay? Well, maybe I'm a little
Oh!
Ouch!
I'm outta here.
Wait wait wait. You want it, I want her. He likes you.
Really?
Yes. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together between us, we can break them.

Hello! A wedding please!
Yes, we want to get married!
All right.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What are you doing?
Oh, this is it
No, just because it's the graduation song.
All right! This is! We will get married!
Are you sure you want to do this?
Well, bye, Mrs. Ross!
Well, bye, Mr. Rachel!
Wait! All right!
Would you ever be a substitute for someone?
It depends on who asked.
What happens if I asked?
Oh, Monday, of course.
Really?
Yes. You're not asking, are you?
No.
Yup! Totally!
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yup! Thank you!

You will not believe it! Joshua came into operation today and guess what happened?
Did he ask you to leave?
No. But I was showing him some twins and I felt his wrist.
Saucy!
What are these?
Electrical plans for the building.
Ok, okay, should I be scared?
I know the switch does something, ok?
So I went to the town hall and took these.
All I had to do was pay $ 25 and wait in line for three hours.
Wow! If only more people knew it.

Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you are all thinking. But Chandler is inside
Yes! No, this is what I was thinking.
So I ask you please, take a moment before judging me.
Oh, no one is judging you.
Oh! All right! You, sir, right place at the right time, call me!
Oh God!
I want that place so much !!
I was so sure it would work!
There are twelve dollars I will never see again!
Okay honey, we'd better go and get that movie.
Hello!
Hello!
Hi Chandler! I miss you already.
Okay, have you seen it ?! With the inappropriate and pinching !!
In fact, I did it!
Ok, so now you think she's attracted to me?
Oh, oh my God! My God! You know about us!
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows and is just trying to drive us crazy! This is the only explanation for this!
Ok, but what about my unkempt ass and my protruding bicep ... She knows!

Ross, um, you've been there a long time. I'm starting to get a little crazy.
All right, I'm going out. Hey, you can turn off the lights.
No, let's leave the lights on.
My God!
Do you want to go now? Because I'll take you right now, buddy! Do you want to go?
Oh good.
Ready? Fighting!
Ok, you know what, in reality, it's great. This helps a lot. Thank you.

All right, remember, something so big and long will be difficult to maneuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
We can please concentrate here, the life of a naked man is poised!
I'm telling you he's dead. What we are going to have here is a fat boy dead on a stick.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, let's hit.
Constant.
Constant.
Ok, a little higher.
Watch out for the angle.
Ok, ok, we are approaching the window. Thread the needle.
Thread the needle.
Is alive! Is alive!!!
Still, we are still struck by it.
All right, pick up the device, retract the device.
He does not seem happy.
Hey-hey, now he's showing us his percussion device.
Hey, it will never end here, buddy!

Well, they have unusual pet names for each other.
Including umm, bad bitch and uh, sick bastard.
Oh God oh!
Contraction!
Yes? All right.
Ooh! Ow !!
Are you watching it ?!
No!
Do not look at you sick bastard!
Honey, I swear! I was not watching!
She is in labor! You like that you're sick motherfucker!
Umm. Umm, I'm just-
To see? To see? It was because you were a fat pervert!
No-no, I'm sure nobody was watching. I just want some privacy.
Do you miss your girlfriend?
Ignore them.
Ross.
What? What?
He is watching me.
Hey! Do you want to live to see your child?
Do not talk to my husband like that stupid bastard!

Pat Sajak?
Yup!
Alex Trebek?
Oh, sure!
Chuck Woolery?
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single presenter of games, the ass that I can not kick.
Say that!
Let's say we are unagi!
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Say that!
You know what? I can easily get out of this, but there's a chance you can do very, very bad!

Hey, Rach, I can borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yes, it's in there.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oohh !! Ohh! Oh oh oh! Oh, oh !!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!!!
Yes, yes.
You?! And-and you?
Yes, but you can not tell anyone! Nobody knows!
Such as?! When?!
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a big deal.
But it's a big deal !! I have to tell someone!
No-no-no-no-no! You can not!
Please? Please?! We simply do not want to talk to everyone, ok? Just promise that you will not say it.
All right! Friend, it's amazing! I mean, it is
I know, it's great!
Aww, I do not want to see it!
We are so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They are trying to get Joey!

And my second-grade teacher was Mrs. Thomas, and my first-grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Madam, Mrs. Gobb?
No Cobb, like in the cobb salad.
Now, what exactly is there in a cobb salad?
Ahh!
What we will do? What we will do?
Uh, we'll think about it. Ducks or clowns.
Oh, will we turn around for the baby?
Do you have a better idea?
All right, call it in the air.
Heads.
Heads is.
Yup! Thank god!
We must assign heads to something.
Right. Ok, ok, the ducks are heads, because the ducks have their heads.
What kind of scary ass clown arrived at your birthday?

Ok, some tricks of the trade.
Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I'll take a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers and start pulling.
Oh, oh, let's say I want to say that I just did something bad.
This would be the principle "I have a hook in an eyebrow and I like it" Ok, let's say I've just received bad news, all I do is try and divide 232 by 13.
And that's how it's done.
Great soap opera acting tonight all, fired class.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
Then I'll have to ask you to keep it down.
Who are you?
Hi, I'm Eric, I'll be Chandler's new roommate.
I'm Chandler's new roommate.
I-I-I do not think so
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
But, he told me on the phone.
He told me in person.
That's strange.
Well, now I'm going to my new apartment. Ehh!

Hey! Look who I found!
Oh, hey guys!
You know, birds have a great sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Yes, if the gifts are hidden south for the winter.
Or could we simply follow your clever lines - some ideas?
No!
I did not think so!
Ok, come on guys, show us where the presents are!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica made me trash! Hmm, I wonder what could I do with Monica that's as good as trash?
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Hey, this is empty.
What?
This bench is empty! I can not believe I never knew it! Oh, the gifts !!!
No, do not look at them directly!
What?
All right, no, we could watch them!
I

Hello! I'm so happy you're here, but it will take a while. I-I wished you had called first.
Oh, all right, I'll be back with your father later.
Oh good.
I needed to talk to you before birth.
Ok, what's up?
I brought something I want to give you, naturally assuming you want it.
But, are you asking me to marry you?
This is your grandma's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
Mom no, let's go! Thank you.
Listen to me!

Perhaps it would have happened if I had been more polite, or had paid more attention, or I ... had a womb.
I can not believe!
I know no, no, you know you do not deserve this, you do not Ross.
You're really, you're so good.
Thank you.
And you're so sweet. And you are kind
Thank you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Eh?
OK it's good.
Oh.
Wait wait wait.
What?
My foot is stuck in my pocket.
What?
No, I can not get it out.
Rachel?
Yes. Hello Mark!
Hello. I just talked to Joanna and she loves you. You understand, you found the job.
Oh, I did it!
Yup.
My God!!
Congratulate !! -lations-regulations.

I can not believe I did! What an idiot!
Oh, stop beating yourself!
People make mistakes!
These things happen!
There are no messages you forgot to give me?
Apparently you are not very good!
I
Philadelphia.
My God! She too! Oh, I ... I have goose bumps.
Really?
Well, you know I'm wearing layers and it's hot.
Yes, yes.
But if not, okay. These idiots may not be interested in you, but the universe is! And that says a lot!
Did you hear it ?!
I do not need you guys to worry about me!
Because the universe matters!
The whole universe!
I really wanted them to care a little bit.
You know, I do not know ... I do not think it's you.
This is a bizarre place.
Hey!
Guys!
Oh no, it's you.
Yes.

I like this. It seems to say "I love you and that's why I have to kill you".
They can not all be bad. Find the one in which you make the eyes of your bedroom. Ohh, here it is.
My God! These are the eyes of my bedroom? Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull that thread?
I'm really enjoying it!
Me too! I'm sorry that that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Ohh. No, all right, he's a friend.
Hey, I do not mean to be presumptuous but tomorrow I have these two tickets for the ballroom finals if you want to go?
Yeah, well, you know, I mean, I missed the semi-finals, so I'd be lost.
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and ... Oh no! No! No! My God!
Ok, do not go crazy. I will go.
No, it's Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I can not take care of her now. That woman is crazy!
Ok, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Yes?
Yeah, um, that's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there, now you think you can hijack her so we can slip out?
What?! No!
All right, but I have two tickets for the dance prom.
Look, I do not think so, Phoebe. Ok I will. But only because you are a friend.

Well, I_I_I ended up with this. Do you want something Ross? Sports? International? Apartments ads?
I will take some sports.
Mine!
All right. Uhh, international.
Okay, look, I ... I know what you're going to say to you guys
You two will have very hairy children.
Ok, I did not know you would say that.
Ross! Janice?!
All right, wait!
Hold on.
Hold on.
This is Ross, okay?
He is our friend.
Obviously he went crazy.
Obviously he lost his mind.
Look, me
So you'll see her again?
Phoebe! Do not put ideas in your head!
I
Damnit Phoebe !!

Hey, we do not have to ...
Yes, we have, um-hmm.
Umm, I think you're really, really great ...
Oh God!
Here we go again.
Why does it keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?
It's my fault?
Or am I just crazy?
I-I-I-I-I do not know, I do not know what to say.
Hey man, this is a family place, put the mouse in the house.

Wait!
Terry!
Please!
Look, I just lost my other job.
All right?
You have no idea how much I need this.
Please help me, for the good of old times.
This poor boy has been in a coma for five years. It is hopeless.
It is not without hope! Dr. Stryker Ramoray is a miraculous. Look, here it comes.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
I'm back baby! Hahaha!

That guy really kicked me on the plane.
Well, you pulled your hair.
He took my snack!
I will not be back!
All right! Oh God, you know what? It's really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. All right.
This does not mean anything, does it?
Obviously! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if I did not have a car! Right?
This is true.
Yes, but only a genius could swallow a sonic blaster cannon.
Oh, I've been there. Yes, I'm going to drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you do not really have it.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in the character! Would you talk to her?
Ah, I think it just changed. He's really kidding me.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
What?! No, you can not, you can not leave me here with them! We are baby-sitters!
The children sleep, I'm sure you'll be alone for a while!
But you-you can not leave me with them! We-we are a team! We are playing an area! They will triple me!
He has something plastic in his mouth, we have to go to the hospital.
But no, because a doctor will not be able to help him, he will know that he will naturally go through his system in about seven years.
I think it's rubber.
I'm pretty sure it's a gun.
Ok, listen, this really hurts. Here we go.
A real man would never have run to the hospital! No! What would you do, what would Krog do?

That was the only way I could do it
Hello! How are the Gellers?
Do not call us that!
The judge would not allow us to get a cancellation! Now we have to get divorced !! Did you throw up a Porsch?
Hey! It's Porsche !!

Hey honey!
Hey!
There is no return to this sofa!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of thing.
Yes, I know, but I imagined a shot, you know?
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you would not think I was, I know, all dead inside.
Oh, it's so sweet! Look Chandler, I do not care if you can not cry, I love you.
Oh, this makes me feel so hot in my tin trunk.
Stop that!
No, I mean, come on, think about it seriously, we get married, we're at the altar and I'm like that.
I do not care, because I know you will feel everything here.
Yes?
Indeed it is!
What, do you think I would only use my son as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
All right, I'm sorry.
I have to fake Ben.

The cart is completely empty! My God, the neighbors have eaten all the sweets!
Well, or that or uh
Joey !!
Yes?
Did you eat all the candy nearby?
Uh well yes, that was the plan, but when I arrived there were only a couple of pieces left!
Yes, and they've been coming all day. They love it!
Do they love my sweets? Oh God!!! I have to go do more !!
Hey Mon, you could also make some lasagna, because something huge could have happened.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my sweets !!
My stole my newspaper! It's like a
Sure!
Yes, since you told me that story about that bike, I ... I could not stop thinking about it.
I mean, everyone should have a-a
Oh my God Ross !!
Do you like?
I
Yes?
Hello dear
And there's dad!

There he is! There he is!
Where is it?
Right where we were watching all night!
He's so cute!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yes, forget it! Throw the towel! Please drop - wowww.

I have to tell you, Bob is fantastic.
Yes, is not he?
It's so nice to meet a guy who's smart and funny and has an emotional age over, like eight.
Do you know what else? It's incredible in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Huh. Beautiful.

and the miracle was that little oil that should have lasted only one day, burned for
Eight full days.
That's right, and that's why we're celebrating Hanukkah today. The end.
Awesome!
Yes?
My favorite part was when
The Armadillo was not really like that
Hey!
Oh.
Wow! It seems the Easter Bunny's funeral is here.
Come on, come on, let's stay-we're lighting candles!
Oh.
Oh.
Ok, I understand why

He says: "Walking with you makes this strange city feel at home".
Yes sure. Good luck!
I'm quitting !! Woo-hoo! I'm fine!! I'm fine!!
Wow! It's exciting, you went to Japan, you invented a woman.
What?
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean it's fictitious. No?
Why would you say that?
Because you're still in Monica.
So you told her that there was someone else, so she would agree to work with you, so why do you think if you spend a lot of time together, maybe something could happen, and ...
You're good. You're good!
Yes, no, I'm quite intuitive and sensitive. It's a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you will not tell her anyway?
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Many thanks.
No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

Excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello.
For God's sake, will you let go? There is no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I understand.
Oh, thank you, sweetie.
No problem. I can not wait for you to meet my friends.
Really?
Yes.
Do not you think that they will judge and ridicule me?
No, no, they will. I alone ... er ...
I can not wait
I know you?
Oh my God, little Stevie Fisher? How have you been?
Well, well, I'm a lawyer now.
You can not be a lawyer. You are eight years old.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I have to run behind the scenes.
Uh, wait, backstage?
Oh yes, my company represents the band.
Ross.
Chandler.
How are you?
Look, do you guys want to meet the group?
Come on.
So, are you one of those who made fun of my father?

Do you have respect for your body?
Do not you realize what you're doing?
Hey, you know, I had you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
The bottom line is that smoking is nice, and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to talk to you.
Really?
He does?
Hey, buddy, how's it going!
Oh, he told you, eh.
Well, yes, I have one every once in a while.
Well, yes, now.
Well, it's not that big ... well, it's true, .. Gee, you know, no-one has ever said it before.
All right, thank you!
God, it's good.
If only she were a woman.
Yes.

Hey, Frank.
Listen, ok, I know you think I liked this totally bad thing, but I did not.
There is someone here who can explain it better than me.
Hi Frank.
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Phoebe is right, Frank.
I know it's hard to hear, but it would have been wrong to do it.
I-I-I was selfish, even if we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not do it.
That's it, is that what it is?
Yes, but not only.
Right, not just that. Umm, even if we love each other as much as we do, nonetheless
Nonetheless.
Nonetheless. Umm, you're too young to really know what you want.
Exactly, exactly.
All right, it's a good kiss goodbye, all right.
Bye Bye.
Ok, no, the important thing is that you understand what I'm saying, you know, but you know, this is clearly wrong.
Ok, I have decided that I will let this happen!
Ok, can I take my bag?
All right, all right, good.
.

Oh, look, look.
The last candle is about to burn.
10, 9, 8, 7 ... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48 ....
Thank you.
Thank you.
A little ... ghostly without lights.
Bwah-hah-hah!
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah ...
Oh oh oh.
Hey, Ross. This is probably not the best time to get it up, but you have to organize a party for Monica.

All this stuff takes up a lot of space. Hey, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
You threw them away!
Oh, I can not tell you how beautiful it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
I mean ... uh, did you know you were putting words in your mouth with me?
I was
No, it's okay! It made me feel like a rockstar!
My God! I am your
I'd better not find you naked in my hotel room!
Look, I took it too far!

Ok, Monica: red right foot.
You could have played
Thank you.
Ok, Phoebe: blue right hand. Good.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the
Oh ok. Do you take my place?
Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.
Nooo!
Hello?
Oh yes, no, I know, I-I did not use it much.
Oh, well, thank you, but, I'm fine, really.
Green. Broke
I have magic beans. It never matters.
Left, left-aww!
Ohhh ... I'm fine.

Hey!
Please tell me that you received the message!
What message?
The actor who played with Mac could not do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the blackboard!
I wrote it on the blackboard, then I went around all over New York looking for you!
I went to Ross's!
I went to the cafe!
I went anywhere they made sandwiches!
Is it the day you die? See, sir, I shuffleboard that day.
This is what you think.
Well, I mean what about your grandmother's friends? Would not they have the recipe?
Well, you know I could have relatives in France who would know it. My grandmother said she received the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What was his name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Nestle Tollhouse
Oh, you Americans always slaughter the French language.
(grabbing a lot of
Yup!! Oh.
I can not believe I spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my closet all the time!
I know! See that it's stuff like that and that's why you're burning in hell !!

So, we are decided, no on the plaid, yes on the rose?
Absolutely!
I'm so on board!
Rachel, did not you just turn it on?
Yes, I did, but you know what? I'm really trying to cut, you know? Good luck, Rach.
Actually I thought about quitting recently.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting, but every Monday morning is like
Tell me about it!
Well, then let's leave! We will stop! We leave everyone!
Looks interesting.
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh, but you could.
Can.
Absolutely!
We can help each other!
We can get - what are those - those patches!
We could be like Patch Sisters!
Oh, you know, we really should stop. Ok, let's leave!
Yup! Great! Give me those butts! From! From!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Alright then!

I am divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Well, maybe it's a competition, you know? Like, do you collect all five?
Someone wants to see?
Nooo!
Oh, hey, do not do it! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw!
Big deal!
How Joey's constant crackling is not annoying?
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
I mean, what the hell is that thing?
... I accept all those faults, why can not you accept me for this?
... The knuckle crunch annoys everyone?
Well, I could live without it.
Well, it's a bit annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, do not listen to him, Phoebe, I think it's catchy.
Oh, "you do it, do not you?"
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"In fact there is not" ... I should really go back to work.
Yes, because otherwise someone could get what he actually ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out and the gloves light up.

Awww! Mel Torme is dead.
Joey, that newspaper is like a year!
Aw! It means the
Hey.
Hey.
Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure?
Well no. But, I bet, you probably know that.
Probably?
Yes, I do not like that word.
Type of thing means "probably" actually.
Yes, uh-huh.
Yes, oh, "Probably your mother will not kill herself", you know?
I'm sorry, but I'm not suspending all my hopes on Rachel and the fact that I live together on-on "Probably!"
You know?
You have to take care of yourself!
In
Bing does not seem so strange now, does he?

Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to greet his future bride.
Ohhh! Wow! It takes your breath away, right?
He is a guardian. How do you feel?
Oh I'm fine.
I can only say, I really admire what you are doing. Raising it alone.
Oh, I will not do it alone. I have Ross.
Oh sure. Now. But what happens when he meets someone else and gets married?
Well, then he has a divorce, it's Ross!
I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they will be there until their real family begins.
Well, I ... it will never happen with Ross.
Oh well, this is what I thought of my first husband, now I'm lucky if my son will spend the weekend with his father, the twins and little Mrs. New Boobs.
All right.
And Tim I just want to say, good luck here.

Hey. Who is that?
New people.
What happened to the Disgustington?
They are having their baby!
Ross is not right, we arrived here first!
Immediately after you left, they brought it to you.
Oh, but not before he gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie who is crowning herself.
Wow! Sorry. So, how are the new people?
Phoebe?
Yes?
Look at that guy near the window, wow!
It's terribly short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good at bed.
Oh, what's wrong with me lately?
I mean, it's like every boy I see, I mean, look here.
Look at that guy, for example, I mean he's not normally someone I'd like to be attracted to, but right now, with the way I feel, all I want to do is tear off his tracksuit pants and baby carrier.
Wait a second! This is the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yes.
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start to go crazy.
Really?! So this happened to you?
Oh absolutely yes!
Oh, and keep in mind, now, I was bringing tercets like that, you know, I've been in medicine ... I was three times more randy.
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from one shop to another sitting on Santa's lap.
Yes. Yes, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout from Evander Holyfield from a

Ugh!
I do not know what I'll do!
I called the company he sent and ... he does not care!
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this is not an emergency, then what is it?
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hey
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
And the guys at work really enjoyed it.
You know, one of them had never been to a graduation party before.
Yes!
And ... and another had never been to a party before, so
So, hey, that, that faith, eh? Friend, it's cute!
Yeah, for sure!
I was thinking that I could choose one of those children for me, I could want one
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So could you say that the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations and every bride who wore it has had a long and happy life.
So you could say, it's a magic ring.
MY GOD!! I did not believe it until you just said it !!

Well, of course, only one of us can go out with her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well, now let's look at it objectively, I think I should go out with her
Uh Huh. Uh Huh.
It's interesting, but take a look. I attend her
Yes, yes I like it, but only to go in another direction
Ok ok. This can go on for a while.
Yes, we should order food.
No Joey! Listen, why not, why do not we let her decide? All right? Hey-hey, we'll do it
It seems legit.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
Ah yes, wait a second now!
Look, we'll have to set a spending limit for the date.
I do not have the money to take her to an extravagant place like that.
Well, I'm sorry, this is what I do on dates.
All right, I guess I'll have to do what I do on dates.
So we decide the spending limit
Yeah. Uh, a slice of six dollars?
I thought more than a hundred.
All right. Can I borrow $ 94?

Hello again.
Hey!
Hey!
Thanks a lot.
Oh, do not thank me, thanks to that fool who never showed up. Ok, I have to go to work.
Do you want help with that?
Oh no thanks, I understand. No I do not!
Whoa! Are you OK?
Thank god! He got up quickly, he was in a hurry.
It's hot. E-and humidity.
This is a difficult combination.
Do you want to come for a lemonade?
As if I did not believe it. Wow! This is a nice place.
What do you mean?
Remember how did you say that you were very dense for poetry? Oh.

Oh!
Hey, someone left their keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Transcriber's Note: Oh come on!
Who would leave the keys of his Porsche behind?
If I had a Porsche, I would have the keys surgically attached to my hand!
Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yes, that's what I drive. I earn four dollars an hour, I have saved for 350 years!
Na-uh! Hey, did anyone lose the keys?
Joey, why do not you put them in the lost world?
Is there a lost and found? My shoe!
Have you left a shoe here?
Well, I did not realize it until I got home.
I would not have walked all the way with a shoe!
You know what?
I'm going to look for the car of that type and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh well, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thank you.

Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he will not sleep.
Carol, we've been there before, okay?
We have fun.
We laugh, let's play.
It is as if we were father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is fantastic with him. Do not be so surprised. I'm a lovely person
Oh, it's so cute.
Oh, I got it for him.
My moms love me It's smart
Hello?
Oh, bye, Ju - Hi, jew!
Uh Huh?
Uh Huh?
Ok. Um, of course, it would be great.
See you then.
Hello.
Did you just say hello, jew?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did it. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yes he likes it. He reaffirms his faith

Now here you are! I would not want my best guest to force his eyes!
Thanks Monica!
Does this smell annoy you?
What's the smell of Joey? No, I can barely smell it here.
Well, let me know if you can, because you know I can make a cake to cover it.
I smell it a bit, baking the cake.
All right!
All right.
Hello? Oh yes, a minute please. And for you. He is the inspector of fire.
Oh! Hello? Yes, this is Phoebe. Really?!
Yes, so it turns out that it was not the hair straightener that started the fire.
No-no, it was the candles.
It is not very good to leave the candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in the school of fire is Uhh Uhh Okay.
Well, I have to go now.

Joey proposed me.
He is crazy ?! You just had Ross's daughter!
Well, I_I said yes.
What?!
You are crazy?
You just had Ross's daughter!
It is so inappropriate.
No, it's worse than that.
It's wrong.
It's ... It's bigger than mine!
I know.
You can not marry him!
Why not? I do not want to do it alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
Well, do you love him?
Sure.
Sure?
Yes, I mean anything.
Honey, the question is ... do you really want to marry Joey?
No. No, I do not know. Could you be a dear and go and tell him?

So you two are married eh? What happened? Have you just left?
Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
I want to wear it every day.
You're so beautiful.
I'm so happy for me.
Hello?
Hey! Did Chandler show up?
Yes, we got it back. It's all OK.
Damn!
Uh, you know what?
I'll tell you who hurts!
It hurts the guy who stole all his clothes in a gym class, so he has to go to the principal's office with nothing but a catcher's glove!
That was it
I will be! Listen, I do not want you to teach my son that stuff anymore. All right?
Beautiful.
Good, but I'll let you know that once I taught him that stuff called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
And I liked being Aunt Rachel, but I'll come back to being boring and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
No, that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys are tying but me
Look, he has no brothers or sisters, someone has to teach him this stuff!
And I did not teach him anything that a normal 6 year old does not know anyway!
Crap!!
I have to go!

Look that! Look that! They are going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
No.
Me neither! We must enter!
Just make your place.
My God! Oranges!
Shh! It's nice to see you again.
Sir, can I see your tickets please?
Yes of course.
I'm sorry, would you like to move your thumb? I can not see the seat number.
Oh, all right, I memorized it. It is 1A.
All right. Mrs. Green! Ok, I'm really sorry! I'm apologizing for ... Okay, I bit my tongue, but I am

Hey! See who's back! She's the birthday girl! How do you feel the birthday girl?
Well, I feel good, but I think you're screwing the rest of the kids.
What?
All right!
You know what?
I realized that it was stupid to get angry for not having a husband and children.
All I really needed was a plan.
See, I want to have three children
Oh let me guess, and you want to have them all at the same time and you want to have them for your brother.
As I was saying, I should probably have the first of three children when I'm 35 and gives me five years.
I love this plan!
I want to marry this plan!
You spent a hundred dollars. This is the limit. You're screwed!
In fact, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically
Oh, oh! So this is how it will happen? Yes, I can break the rules, you know!
Oh yeah? What will you do?
I do not know.
Why am I not surprised?
Do you know what Ross is? I will not let you escape with this!
I do not think you have much choice.
Well we'll see!
Bye Bye!
Yes bye bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Yes. Yes. Only here and there.

Pope?
I'm here!
Hey!
Hello. God, it seems that yesterday you came out to watch me work.
Dad, we can not believe you're selling the house.
Well, it is time for a new family to start their memories here and it is hoped that their control will be clarified before finding the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
We take our things and leave from here.
I am sorry that we can no longer memorize your childhood things.
Oh, all right, I can not wait to see everything again! All the memories
Well, I do not know what's in the boxes below, but I know there are six or seven
in the past
Yes, not as much as you loved playing the raw meat eater.
Hey, it's unreasonable to expect a child to wait for one

Ok, I opened my mouth.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a Ben hospital worker. It's Ben ... to the rescue!
Ben, are you ready?
All right, give me your foot.
Okay, at three o'clock, Ben.
One two Three.
OK, that's it, Ben.
What do you see?
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark outburst. Wait. Yes, it is indeed a dark outburst.
Phoebs, it's open! It's open!
Wait! You forgot your legs!

You have a very impressive resume, Miss Green. I especially like what I see here about the implementation of a new storage system.
Thank you.
Archiving system?
Oh, oh!
You mean those - those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
Surely he rejoiced the inside of the files.
Well, they ... they do more.
I have noticed that you have been entrusted with many rather important responsibilities.
Yes, Joanna was really an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel was really amazing in getting my morning bagel for me. It's incredible how you almost do it
I-I-I, of course, have more responsibility for this.
Oh yes, well, there's coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes, it's very good. Now, much of this work is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that
And Rachel should not have any problem with that. The only problem could be a bit 'too friendly, if you understand what I mean.
I like working with designers!
With them, under them, what is the difference? Eh, Rach?

Chandler, do you have an assistant, do you?
Called? You told her I was sick, right? Always tell him I'm sick!
Chandler, listen to me baby, I know you can do it. All right? You have a beautiful smile.
I want it?
Yes! All right, maybe you do not have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try to look sexy.
All right.
Or not.

Where's Chandler?
Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!
How did you find out?
Hey! What are you doing here again?
Relax, Ross. She is not made of ice cream!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I've arranged the states geographically ...
What happened in Atlantic City ?!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Did not you hear me say "Du-ude?!"
And this girl is eyeing Chandler, okay?
So after a while he ... he goes to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler is not the kind of guy who only goes to bars and gets out with the girls, and you're right, Chandler is not the kind of guy who only goes to bars and has sex with the girls.
Did you kiss a boyfriend? !! My God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very nice boy.
Oh, Monday, I laughed so hard
Ho-ho, so strong that we had to throw the underwear back?
Any guy, you kissed a guy.

So, will you stay with me as long as I need you?
Of course I am!
Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.
I've read all kinds of books about pregnancy and childbirth, but I-I was not just thinking about reading the part about what to do when the baby comes.
And ... and then guess what?
The child is coming and I do not know what to do.
Oh, can I vomit in my diaper genie?
No. Honey, you'll be fine.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.
All right.
Now do not worry! Everything will be OK.
it
Hey!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I just made Bamboozled Chandler! That's not a sexual thing. It was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.

Okay, the reason I asked you guys for today's brunch is because I thought about who my bridesmaid should be.
My God! This is! I really hope it's you!
I hope it's you.
Me too!
First of all um, I love you so much and you are both so important to me
Ok, blah-blah-blah-blah !! Who is it?!
Well, I was thinking that maybe we could invent a system in which we exchange the maidens of honor for each other.
As hypothetically, if Phoebe was mine
Yup!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
Yet.
If Phoebe was my maid of honor
Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe, I'd be Rachel, that way we'll all do it once and no one would be angry.
Yes, it's actually a good idea.
Yes I will. So who can be yours?
Well, this is the best part. Umm,
Why is this the best part?
Because then I do not have to!
Good of
I'm not really deciding!
Well!
Yes, that's right.
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a beautiful lady!

If you want to give Joey a Christmas present that upsets the whole building, why not get him something a little thinner, like a wrecking ball or a small vial to release in the hallway?
It is not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
Oh god, my eye! "
I mean, it's so annoying.
Yes thanks. See, this is the way normal people should react to the battery.
Phoebe, do you have Joey's battery to annoy Rachel, so she would not want to live there anymore?
Perhaps at some level.

Joey? Could you have it? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, I'm taking over for our appointment. These are for you.
Oh, lilies. Joey, they're my favorites. Thank you.
And, a biscuit!
Well, a biscuit half.
In reality, it's just a bag.
It was a long walk from the flower shop and I was starting to feel faint like that
Oh God!
Is fantastic!
Actually I feel like I'm going to a real date!
Although, I get a bit of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up around there.
Hey, let's go now, this is a real date.
Uh, so cute place you came here.
Foosball, eh?
Box of pizza
Oh, a subscription to
Yes, it's actually my roommate.
I'd like to meet him. He looks like a boy standing.
Ah yes, but it's very protective of me, so it's better for you to look at yourself.
Hey, so this roommate is nice?
HM-mmm.
Oh yes, it must be hard to hold his hands, huh?
Yes, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
No-no-no-no, it's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!

Can you believe what an idiot Ross was?
Yes I know. It can become really competitive.
Has. Ah, ah.
What?
Oh, bye, kettle? This is Monica. Are you black.
Please! I'm not as bad as Ross.
Oh, I beg to differ. The
That was it
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Well, do not play Raquetball!
He forgot to leave his grip!
He did not have glasses!
Well, it seems like you two have problems.
Goodbye, baby.
Hi, bela.
Are they waiting for me to do this?
So will you tell him?
Why should I tell him?
How about why if you do not, your mother could do it.
Oh...
What are you guys doing here?
Uhhhh .... does not even have a jock!
... What did I ask?

God. I feel violated
Someone else felt that he just wanted to remove the skin from his body, have something else to do?
Ross, at ten.
IS? It feels like two.
No,
What?
There is a beautiful woman at eight, at nine, at ten!
Oh. Hello!
Is fantastic! It makes women seem to dream like low, fat and bald men!
Well, go see her! It is not with anyone.
Oh yes, and what would be my opening line? 'I'm sorry. Blarrglarrghh.
Come on. You are a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she
She could never have a woman like that in a million years.
Thanks friend.
Oh, oh, but you know, you always see these really beautiful women with these guys really nothing, you could be one of those guys.
Could you do it!
Y'think?
OK, it's enough of the sight. Look at it, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
OK.
Is fantastic! Helen, could you come here for a moment?
Thanks Helen, it will be everything.
The last time I do it, I promise.

I'm so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh Huh.
And I'll cook everything you want here, and you'll do anything in there!
Yes, you will do it! And are you kidding me ?!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please, please, please?
All right.
All right.
So, are we going in there?
I'm!!

Wow!
It is actually in the manual.
I can not go out with you or have a hot dish in my office.
I can not believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I appreciate the fact that you defended me. I felt really good. It made me like you even more.
I know, I know that I like you too much. But we ... we can not go out. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Wow!
What?
Just hearing you say it's forbidden, it's very hot.
Really?
Yes.
Well, I_I_I do not care how hot it is-it's wrong.
Stop that!
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's bad. It is a taboo.
Close the book!
We also take a hot dish!

Rachel, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you have a great job! Good friends
Yes! So when are you getting married?
Oh I'm not, I just like to try them.
I do the same thing
I'm kidding. I'm getting married on July 25th
I'm joking too. I will get married in December.
So when are you getting married?
Oh May 15th
Oooh is approaching!
Yes!
So who is your photographer?
Jeffery.
We met with him. Did he show you pictures of the naked marriage he did?
The best man? Wow!
I know! I almost canceled my marriage. Oh, who is your band ?!
Oh, my girlfriend wants the Swing Kings.
Oh, you're so lucky. My girlfriend wants the heavy metal band of Carcass.
Ooh, is it written with a "C" or a "K"? My God! It does not matter; they are both fantastic!
Oh you know what?
You know what?
Now that you know what you want, you should go to Kleinman and put it in half.
This place is so expensive.
So, this comes in another color o

I'm telling you, for years, schoolchildren will study it as one of the biggest first dates of all time.
It was amazing!
We could be totally ourselves, we did not have to play any games ...
So you already called her?
Let her know that I like it?
What are you, crazy?
It's the day after!
How much does it seem necessary to me?
I'm right, right?
Oh yeah. Yes. Let it dangle.
I can not believe my parents pressure me to find any of you.
Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Which, by the way, is the real treatment of San Francisco. I took his car.
His answering machine?
No, it is interesting to note that its leaf blower has collected.
So, uh, why did not you say anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. The last time I left a spontaneous message, I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Look look! I'm Rachel and Barry. No, do not look at them all at once!
Ok, ok, what's going on?
Ok, they're just talking ...
Yes, well, do you look angry? It seems like he was just told to push something?

So, what do you do for a living?
Well, um, I've worked in the past few years ... which is fun because, that was not even my major.
Oh no I thought you said they could shoot without you.
I thought they could ... I'll try to get back as soon as possible. I'm sorry.
This is fun
Hey, do you think ... would it be too weird if I invited Carol to join us?
Because she is, she is alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
I presume.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Do you want to come and join us?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on.
These people will go down.
You guys will, will you?
Let's try to make the scoop!
Come on.
Come on.
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches the sixth grade.
And Kristin, Kristin ... does something that, oddly enough, was not even her major!

All right.
All right.
When I was six years old.
HM-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel.
Instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken you go around.
It was embarrassing; the children made fun of me.
It was a rather difficult year.
Is fantastic!
To see?
I already feel like getting to know you a little better!
Thank you.
Ok, come on.
Now we can go and eat.
Here we go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!

Choose one, choose one! Here, what about that?
Those are garden furniture!
So, how, people will come in and think, "Uh-oh, are they out again?" Obviously!
And the birds?
I do not know, the birds do not say "Hi, sit here, eat something".
Choose one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so, forget the birds, but the big red bugs suggest a refined cuisine!
Well, you want to catch the birds, catch the birds!
Not so, I will not do it! Kip would have liked the birds!

Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?
Bijan for ... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe, after work, you and I could go, maybe get a cup of coffee.
Oh, I actually have plans.
Hello, Annabelle?
You bet. Maybe another time?
Hey, it's not the first time I've lost a girl for a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!

It was great!
Phoebe and Gary are
It was great.
We are the hottest! Eh?
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
I
Hey guys! What's going on?
Hey, Joey! Is not that the girl who greeted you the other day?
How are you'?

So, what are you going to do?
What can I do? A person wants to break up, you break up.
Hey, no! Come on, guys, call her and solve it.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, I do not have to wait a while?
Hey, it's not like swimming after eating, pick up the phone !!
You know that the whole thing about swimming is a myth.
Yes, tell my Uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, he really believes it.

It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really big this morning.
Well, okay, so what happens now? Go, get the eggs, put us inside.
Ok, it will take some time to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? As in "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five actually.
Five? Ok, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We make five because this gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attack.
That's all! 25 percent? This means that it is like a 75% chance of not having any children!
Hey, you know, I was thinking, what are the chances that if ... if you do stuff like 200 in there?
Sweetie, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Okay, well, you know what, do not worry guys, because I - I'll do it every time I need to do it right.
Well, you see, the - the thing is, we - we just have it, we have a chance to get it right.
Umm, it costs $ 16,000 every time you do it.
So, we're using a little bit of all the money we have to do only this time.
Whoa !! All right, this is a
No, I'm sorry.
Wow! You guys do not really know anything!
I know! Why do not you get drunk! This worked for many girls in my high school.

Sorry. So, how's it going with Joey?
Oh, just great.
He plays me now with the codes.
One is: "Bring me food".
Two is: "I'm with a girl, bring us some food".
Three is: "I'm lost and I can not find food".
Hey! Everything is going well?
Yes! She is right in there!
Oh great. Hey! Go get those pants off, they look ready!

Hey!
Hey!
Do you guys have something to eat? I just went to Johnos for a bit of chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I brought Larry there to eat, but it was all violated. So we turn it off!
Phoebe, if this guy keeps closing all our favorite places, where are we going to eat ?!
I do not know, clean places?
Umm, yum!
It's Danny.
Do not let it in! I should be at a sailing gala.
We'll be right there! Can not you say it starts later?
What? What kind of gala race starts at night?
The false type!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. Do you have a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party.
Ok, great!
Hey, guys, do you know what Larry would say? He said "I'll see you ladle".

You are so efficient. I love you!
Here we go!
No-no-no! We need something old!
Ohh, great, I have a condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
It will work!
I do not think so
Ok, now we just need something borrowed!
Here, take this.
This is stealing!
No, we'll bring it back! Put it under your dress.
Ohh.
Ok, one thing at a time.

I'm sorry for that. So what did you do?
Oh, not much. I ... I have a job.
Oh that's great.
Why are you- why are you so tanned?
Oh, I ... I went to Aruba.
Noooo! I'm lying. I'm so drunk.
Oh God, oh
Great, Monica, you know what, you could have called, I've been up here, I was worried ...
Monica? Monica!
Water rules!
Yes, yes, it does. Ok, look, the restaurant called, they want to know if you want to show up for work?
No. Going to
Ok, Monica, what are you doing? You will lose your job! This is not you!
No it's me!
You know, I'm not just the person who needs to chill the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they arrive!
You know, when I'm with her, I'm much more than that.
I am - I am Monana!
Hello? Yes, she is, wait a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the people on the credit card.
Helloooo? Yes, my God. Thank you.
What?
They arrested Monica.

Note the pictorial lines and the thin dough on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors, since his elusive subject was the light itself.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain thinks of monster truck!
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not written M-O-N-A-Y.
Me only ...
I wrote it phonetically for you.
Phonetically?
Yes, yes, it means ... do you know? We just ... we do not have time for this.
Ok.
Ok, but you know what? I must say that I am really impressed that you managed to memorize all this so fast!
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Wow. What does he do
No idea!
But I told the boy that he will die in the next scene, so I suppose it means "you'll be eaten by a bear".
Ok! So we move on to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No advertisement and guy, you can not
Come on! you...
No!

Oh. Oh, oh.
Hey! What happened to you? Why did not you come?
Done!
Have you just finished?
Well, I wanted to be complete.
I mean this - this is clearly very, very important for you, for us!
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
So, right?
I'm sorry.
It does?
It does? It does? Yes, I wanted to give everything that happened? only another glance starts.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said you read it twice!
Look, you know what, or does it or not, and if you must too
No, Rach, no. Not me, not me, not me
Are you sure?
Oh sure! I'm sure.
I know.

You married again.
Yup.
So this is your second marriage in two years.
Yes, the second in two years. Third in general.
Ross, I've been a divorce attorney for 23 years and I've never had so much work with a client.
Why do not you tell me what happened.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and got drunk
I'm sorry, is it the same Rachel that name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes Yes Yes! But, I - I do
Oh, it's better then.
This was just a drunken mistake and I needed to get it canceled.
I see. Have you considered the therapy?
I just think of the
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Easy.
And we will need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
No problem.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ooh!
There's no way to do it without her?
Because I prepared everything ready, um, it was, it had already been taken care of.
No!
All right.

So, Phoebs owes $ 7.50, Monica, you owe $ 10, and Rachel, you need fifteen big ones.
But hey, thank you for teaching us Mary Cross-Eyed. Guys, we have to play it in our usual game.
Well, here's my $ 7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Oh, I cursed him So bad things will happen to those who spend it.
All right, I'll take it.
The bad things happen to me anyway.
In this way I can break them with a film.
Well, this leaves the big green poker machine, which owes fifteen ...
Ah! Eh?

Do you want to do it now?
Great!
Ok, I just want to be sure this time. Andie McDowell is the girl from
No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the type from
Oh yeah. OK thanks.
You are welcome.

it is for me not to see you anymore
This is crazy!
You can not do this!
What are you going to tell her?
Oh God.
Ohh, you already accepted this, right?
It's terrible, I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do it if I want my marriage to work.
And I do it, I have to do
Ohh! Lucky me! My God! what
You have no idea what a nightmare it was. It's so difficult.
Oh yes, really? Is it Ross? Yes? Ok, well, let me make it a little easier for you.
What are you doing?
Soon!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yes, that's how I'm crazy !!

These little women. Wow!
You like it, eh?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I do not see how he can ever forgive her.
Umm, Jo is a girl, is short for Josephine.
Chandler.
Hello.
Hello.
Joey.
Hey-hey!
Hey.
This is Monica.
Whoa!
And this is Rachel.
Hello!
Whoa !!
I'm going to have a coffee.
Hey, how do you do something?
We do not, really.
Well, then, do you guys have a lot of big projects?
Oh yeah! Yes, no, we will connect, you know bond, and everything.
Yes, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and catch some ninja stars.
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a prostitute.
You know, we do not really take advantage of life in the city.
I know.

Ok, Chandler!
All right.
And your horoscope says: "On the fifth, someone special will give you a gift".
Oh, well, thank you in advance.
Op, but the twelfth brings the spasm of a lover.
Oh, wait and the nineteenth secret crush announces.
Hey guys!
Hey !!
My God! I'm Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!!!!!!
Oh this is true. It's your first day! So are you tired of fighting fake crime with your robot buddy?
I'm crazy? The protagonist in my TV series? I've dreamed it for years! Why am I not preparing ?!
No! Joey, you'll be great!
But I had to act with a robot Pheebs and ... and I know nothing about the technology!
I can not even use Chandler's computer except to find porn!
And - and that's just because it's right there when you turn it on!
I think the spasm of our lover will begin a little early this month.
I'll wait.

This is the last minute, so I want to apologize for the mess. All right?
My God! It certainly did not look like this when I lived here.
I know!
Now look, there's only one problem though.
There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay with Joey.
Well, since the fire was a little my fault, I guess you should stay here.
Hey! Hey-hey, now it's nobody's fault, Phoebe. All right? It was an accident.
Well no, it was my fault so you should take the nice room.
All right!
So Rachel!
You are the first guest at the Hotel Monica!
Umm, you just have to tell me how you like eggs in the morning.
And I thought to take them, you know, to bed.
Oh, you've been through so much.
I have.

This is only Bactine. It will not hurt.
Sorry, it was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find its owner.
Why do not we simply put "poor little Tooty" in the hall?
During a blackout? He would have been trampled!
Yes?

Well, I want you to know there may be times when I might not be around like this.
But I will always come back, this way.
And sometimes I could stay away for longer, like this.
But I will always come back, this way.
And sometimes, I want you to steal the third, and I'll go like this.
He is so extraordinary.
Oh I know. Look at him.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Anything. I do not think it's his name.
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
He does not do much, does he?
No, this is practically everything.
Guys, do you want to have a coffee?
Yes.
Okay see you later.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Come on, they'll love you.

Here it is.
My God! This is a six-hour pill! That's all! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
Oh, it's like a huge weight has been lifted!
Why look, no hair loss, no rash, no beehive, I'm so happy!
Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria ... Oh.

Well, thanks for lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I did not pay, I thought you paid!
So apparently we do not pay for food anymore. See what I see?
How did it go?
He had the money in the wrong hand.

All right, I'm going to get my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility to make sure nothing happens?
I will do it.
Who wants it? Anyone?
I said I will do it!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I will do it myself.
Monica! I'm not going to ruin everything!
You know what?
You're right, I'm sorry.
Actually you've been a great help tonight.
Yes, and thank you for putting my grandmother in the cabin and making sure to get to the hotel safely.
Well, of course, this is what I'm here for!
All right. Sorry.
Ugh! What grandma?

Hello. Tag, I have a conference call today is the right one?
Yes, at 4:00.
Okay thank you.
This will be everything.
Wait!
Wait!
Did you see that?
That mail guy had no idea there was anything between us.
You saw my huge pile of porn, right?

Hey Monica, it's Chip.
Yesss !!
Who is Chip?
Shhh!
Well, today I'll take you to the bank, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Call me. After.
Chip, it's Chip Matthews.
The guy who brought Rachel to the dance? Why is he calling you?
Because I ran into him in the bank, he's still so cute.
Monica, you're so lucky! It's like the most popular boy at school !!
I know!! Chip? Hello! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. All right. Ok, goodbye. Oh my God, we just had
I was leaving.
Good! Because I have a report on the product to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I do not fall asleep.
Why? Did you write it?
Wow! Look at that, he called Chip Matthews. I wonder what he wants?
Well, actually ...

Here is your Phoebe tea.
It's so good. Oh thanks.
Good.
I'm so happy you liked it.
Oh!
What?!
What?! He made tea!
Oh! No, I think I just had a contraction.
What do you?
My God!
I like her. She sees intelligent.

I have no idea, it could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oh alright. It was worth the wait and I do not mean just tonight.
I really
: Yeah, well, your friends are in violation of it.
I've been a good boy so far, but I do not need this pain.
I'll call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegitimately submitting her grandmother's apartment.
Your friends are out of here friend.
Why do not you tell me something I do not know!

All right! I found one that fits!
Well, you know what they say, 23
Whose is it?
Oh does it matter ?! All that matters is that you look so beautiful.
Oh damn!
No! Do not say that! Do not say that!
Damn!
No no! Return to repeat!
Damn!
Oh shit!
Oh shit!

Hey, Rachel! Hey, do you mind if I read my comic books here?
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's pretty hard to concentrate.
What?!
He just called and said he will work late!
She keeps lying to me!
That's all!
You know what?
I'll just go there and I'll deal with them now!
So, Chandler, I ... I'd like to come tonight.
Really?
Oh absolutely. Let's say, around seven?
Yup.
Good. I really can not wait for you and me to have a sexual relationship.
Hey-hey, take a look! Check it out! Ugly naked boy has a naked friend!
Oh yeah! My God! This is
Yes it is! Ross nude !!

Yes, because I was

Noo! Could be! I do not know.

Well! Here! Take an excursion!
Excuse me, sir! This lady played my fourth, this is my money.

What do you say if we talk about it during dinner?
Ok lady, you're out of here.
No! No, you can not stop me! No!! I will not come back! I will not be back in that hell hole!
I'm just bringing you out!
Oh ok.

Hey!
Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that might make you want to stay married. We register and
No!
Ross, let's go!
No!
Listen, look, I've been thinking a lot about how to tell you and the bottom line, Ross, we can not stay married.
I do not know if it's true.
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, okay, you know what it is?
Oh Ross, let's go! This is not, this is not a wedding !! This is the worst hangover in the world! Ross, listen, if
All right. Ok I will.
Thank you. Hey, hey, er, is there, is there something like a shower of cancellation?

Hey! What are you guys doing?
Hey.
Make holiday candy for the neighbors.
Yup!
So I will never be able to win again?
How much has he ever really won before?

He's so cute. So where did you grow up guys?
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
How, how could this happen?
My God.
What?
Suddenly I had the feeling of falling. But they are not.

Thank you.
It was very nice Ashley.
No, no.
So, is it my turn now?
I'm next!
Oh!
Evidently they do it.
What?!

Ok, I'm taking a break for this, I go out the window.
No, no, no, no! I was waiting, forever, to go out with Lorraine. Take it easy.
Take it easy? Take it easy? You put me with the woman I downloaded twice in the last five months!
Can you stop screaming? You're making me nervous, and I can not go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go on, come on !!!

Hey guys, guess what?
Are the British coming?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmas. I will be one of those donations for collections of people.
Yes, I already have my bell and later ... I'll take my bucket.
Ohh.
Yes, yes, I will be out there to spread the joy to people.
I mean, last year, I spread a little joy, but not enough.
So this year, I will do the whole city.
You know, I knew a girl in high school did it. She was
I can not
Oh! Look, time is up! My turn!
Was it half an hour?
It's your timer.
You know, I do not like bragging, but I give the
Okay, so massage me well!
Ah! Ahh !! Ahh !!
It's so good, is not it?
It's so nice that I do not know what I did to deserve it!
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Goodbye muscles !!

Oh whoa-whoa-whoa!
Wait a minute, open your hand; let me take a look.
Quarter.
Of me.
Lint?
I do not care.
What is this?
A Canadian coin?
Get out of here!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
No drinks near the bucket!
Set it there and then you can make a contribution!
And you can leave the wounded bunny there too!
Hi Bob!
I thought I told you to get out of here!
Uh, Phoebe complained and we'll move you to a less prestigious place.
Well, because we thought you knew it !! It's so obvious! God, it would be like saying to Monica: "Hey, you like clean things".

Hey, Joe! Do you want to shoot some circles?
Oh no, I can not go. I'm practicing; I auditioned to host a new game.
Oh nice!
Is fantastic.
Yes, yes, and if I have Dr. Drake Remoray by day, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
You'll be perfect for this! This is already your name!
But the audition lasts a couple of hours and I do not even understand the game.
Well, do you want some help?
Oh really? Would be great! You guys can be the competitors!
Awesome!
Ok, I suppose we could lose middle school girls one more time.
All right! Let's play at Bamboozled!
Deceived?
Yes, is not it a nice name?
Yes!
No!
Oh. Ok, breathe.
Oh honey, I think I have one too!
Watch this! Here we are!

I'm sorry. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the section of Paleontology, on the fifth floor, stack 437?
Well ... yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my turn.
No! No!! No! Can I talk to someone in charge, please?
How can I help you?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase safety in the paleontology section?
See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-they're fine, rolling in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
But as for the increase in security, I fear the library is very lacking.
I can not help you.
Very well.
Well!
If, if I am the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I will go there and defend myself!
And do not follow me!

All right. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
My God! Phoebe looks, it's Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look that! It's a line of ants! They are working as a team!
Phoebe!
Right, oh yes
Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking them.
Ugh, I hope you let it go down easily.
Here we go.
Come on, Phoebe, look at that!
They are not melting, look at them.
Ok, this is, you know what it is?
That's a, this is a second date, that's what it is!
Look at it, put your hand on your thigh ...
Oh no! That's really nothing, she is
Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he will marry her, and this is all your fault.
You know where I work!
I want it?
The cinema, you always came.
Do you still work at the multiplex?
Oh, as if I had to give up that job! Popcorn and candy for free, whenever I want. I can make you free posters for your room.
Thanks, I'm ready. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh yes, but I can stay out late.

Nice car!
Yes, it's not mine.
I love your car.
Yes it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Me too! Yes. And comfortable. Do you like leather seats?
Yes!
He has them!

Joey, please!
Sorry.
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Hello children!
Hey! Do you want to play table football? Please?
All right.
No-no, no! We have to move the table to my room, yes! For all the boxes. Come on!
All right, I have a question.
Hello bye hand of the puppet Joey?
No, the silent thing!
You mean this.
Um-hmm! Look, I_I_I do not know what else I can take! Did you know that he registered mine
Okay, you know, this maybe hard but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
All right, I think I can hold out a little longer. We play a game.
All right.
No-no-no-no!
YUP!!
Uh guys,
Ok, so it's out of here.
Okay, you know what, because you said it, I will not do it tonight.

I know it does not make much sense
Much
Look Chandler, it was instinct! All right? I just went for this!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the biggest sandwich in the world!
So you did not choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you are like my brother!
Really?!
Yes! In fact, to show what you mean by me here.
Thank you.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is it?
Oh-oi-ho, yes!
To see?
HM-hmm.
Oh-whoa-hey, buddy, what are you doing ?!
I thought you showed me how much you meant to me.
Yes. With a bite! Gee-and-E-ZEE!

Check the ring.
Beautiful! One and a half carats easy.
Hello.
Hey-hey Phoebe!
What?
Chandler will ask Monica to marry him!
Oh I know, I helped choose the ring.
Did you tell her before you told us?
Well, it came in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You understand it, do not you? Guys? Guys?

Let's see.
Congress is discussing a new law on reducing the deficit ... the mayor wants to increase the subway rates again ... the high today was forty-five ... and - oh, the teams have done sport.
What about Glen? It could be a Glen.
Nah ... not-not special enough.
Ooh! What about Agamemnon?
Waaay too special.

Hey, Phoebe!
Hey!
Check it out. How much are a man?!
Wow! Beautiful! Manly is also a kind of slut.
You know, I'm starting to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh Huh.
Silk? It feels really good!
Ah yes, I'm sorry for that.
All right. Come, come in
Thank you for letting me stay here! I mean that Monica's place was nice, but her girlfriend definitely stares a lot.
Oh.
My God! Make a big Chandler!
Uh Huh. Yes, I - I have a talent for impressions.
Well, maybe after we react, you can do me.
Yes No !!

Hey! You guys! Take a look, take a look! Guess which job I had.
I do not know, but Donald Trump wants his black blue blazer.
What?
Blue blazer back. He ... wants it back.
But you, you said black. Why would she want her black blue blazer?
Well, you ... you know what I meant.
No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
So, what job did you get Joe?
Oh, ah, tourist guide to the museum. Yes, Ross took it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, do not you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
I just walked into the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like a torture!
You know, if we ever go to war and you're caught, you're ready for one
Keep getting worse and worse!
You know?
I mean, it's pretty bad that I'm in love with my roommate partner, which, by the way, I think she knows.
Because every time we are in the room together there is this strange energy between us.
And call me crazy, but I think I like it too.
And now I saw her naked.
I mean, at least, when I saw her in her clothes, I guess her body was covered with holes or something.
But there are no oxen, she is smooth!
Smooth!
Wow! Could everyone see his dress?
Yes! My God!

So, you and Angela, eh?
Yes enough.
Oh, that's what he meant!
You know, if they shorten it, they should call it MUSE!
You know, abbreviation of museum, and avoid all the confusion!
Yes, most is a place
Ok, that's fine, so I'll take it to the MET.
Yes, uh, ok, there's this fantastic bookstore on Madison Avenue.
You know what?
Love architecture, do you know what you should do?
You should take a walk to the fifth St. Patrick's Cathedral and there is this small and small bakery that she would love.
Damn, it seems you should go on this date!
But they are not! . You know what to do if you're in the mood for Thai food ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, go
Ok.
You have to tell me exactly what to do there.
Ok, when you enter the museum, take the right, that is the wing of antiquity.
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I go to the door and do the right thing

Hey!
Hey, so everything was fine with the cancellation?
Oh yes, no problem. It's all right.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you want to go see a movie?
Oh yes, why not?
Phoebe?
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Ok, um, I'll get my sweater.
All right. Do you want to hear something strange?
Always.
I have not received the cancellation.
What?!
We are still married! Do not tell Rachel. See you later.

Hey! Are you OK?
Fabulous.
Listen, critics of the drama are nothing but people who could not make it as actors. Do you know what you should do?
Exactly. So you did not, you did not say anything to Issac, right?
Oh, well, I tell Issac everything.
You say, of course you know. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, bye! You know, we did not actually meet ...
You dog!
Yes, I suppose I'm a dog. But Issac, see I-I happens to have a girlfriend.
Oh, right, Rachel cleans coffee.
Yes it is that. Listen, I do not want to hurt her.
Oh, hey, my friend, no matter how much we love them, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Yes. Listen, can you keep this information for yourself?
Aw, no problem friend. You know, we have to look at each other. We're the same, you and me.
Actually no, we are not.
Yes, we are.
No, we are not.
Yes, we are.
No, we are not!!
Ok, we're not.
Right.
But we are.
Beautiful. I just have to know that you will not tell your sister.
I can promise not to tell him anymore.

Emily!
My God! What are you doing here?
Alone, I had to see you once again before take-off.
You are so sweet.
I mean, this is a big candy bar. (He's holding one of those huge ones
Me too.
Well, that's me. Here, you have this. I'm only allowed a piece of carryon anyway.
Wait, listen.
I - I have to tell you something.
Umm, I was thinking, I'll go out and I'll say it.
All right?
I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Oh. Thank you.
No problem.

Monica!
She is sleeping.
I know, just a quick question, a quick question. Which was
Strong impact
Sorry, I can not sleep.
Ooh!
Where is that book you're reading with the two women who skated and wore ice, wearing those hats with flowers?
Because every time I look at that cover I'm like
It's in the living room where there's even a light! And nobody will kick you in the shin.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking the real estate section
Yes?
Watch this.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house.
Oh, he even has a tree with a broken limb in front of him and uh, the window in the attic is Oh my God!
!
What? What happened to the window in the attic?
I can not believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I can not believe it - they did not even tell us!
I can not believe I do not know what happened to it yet
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the newspaper! Yes, we are surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Sorry!

OK then
Anything?
Look, you and I received a gift.
All right?
We have to do something with this.
Simil-like, manual modeling!
Eh?
O-o magic!
And you
I have to go back to
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa-whoa!
We could have our show!
You know, we could clap together, people will love it!
Eh?
E-e-e I wrote a song for us!
(Singing, for the music of
All right.
But you did not even hear the chorus!

Well, will you understand well? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Dad, he does not care.
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all that is - is growing new things!
See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes you think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh my God, do you really think so?
Well, can you blame her?
Well, I do not know, I suppose we might have subconsciously favored you, you've been a marvel of medicine! The doctor said your mother could do it
Daddy, Daddy, I do not want to hear about it.
Really?
Well, not now.
Okay, Monica came here for some memories and, damn it, we'll give her a little!
Ok, take some empty boxes.
All right?
We'll take from my stuff and anything we can sell like her, we'll put them inside.
Great!
You know, Joey, I could teach you to surf if you want.
Could?
Yes! I have sailed all my life. When I was fifteen my father bought me my boat.
Your boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.

He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Count in our heads just as well
I think I've finished.
The fun is over!
Wait, guys! If, if we follow the rules, it's still fun and means something!
Uh Huh!
I think I'll take the flight.
Guys, the rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!

Japanese spaghetti dehydrated under fluorescent lights ... it does
Question. You're not dating someone, right, because I met someone who would be perfect for you.
Ah, yes, perfect could be a problem. You said "co-dependent" or "self-destructive" ...
Do you want an appointment on Saturday?
Yes thanks.
All right. It's cute, it's fun, it's ...
Is he a him?
Good yes!
...Oh God.
I- only- I thought- Well, Shelley.
Now I'm going to rinse in the toilet ...
Ok, goodbye...

Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Well, let's go to a bad guy and find out.
Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can slam the rabbit against my back.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey friend. What happens?
Maybe you can tell me.
My agent would like to know why I did not go to the audition I did not know I had today.
The first good thing I get for weeks.
How could you not give me the message?
!
Well, I'll tell you that I like feeling guilty, but, ah, it was not me.
Yes it was! It was him! Uh Huh! Ok, it was me!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.

Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a boy who has a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There's this guy in my class who said he was in love with me.
Whoa!
Whoa what?
Ross has a boyfriend.
I do it
Really?
Yes!
I do not know.
I mean, last year Elizabeth now ... now this guy.
What-what-what-what is it ?!
Am I giving a kind of sexy professor atmosphere?
Not now.
It-it-The point is that my natural charisma made him fail in his interim period.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the baby!
I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
You know, I could not concentrate and blushed every time he looked at me.
I mean, come, you remember what it means to be 19 and in love.
Oh yes! Thanks a lot! Oh, that's - it's actually like the French drink it.

A new pair of Chan-Chan men's shoes! Yup!
Yup! I-I have never seen a roll like this in my life!
It's right, honey! Ok, what do I want now?
All right, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Choose a number! This is yours
8. 8!
Thank you!
If you take it, we all buy a steak dinner here!
Yes, I see.
Take as long as you want.
Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it.
I will be here.
Not smoking.

We'll really do it, eh?
It seems so.
You know if, if this is too weird for you, we can still pull back
I got it!
All right.
Susan! Hello!
Hey!
Thank you very much for coming.
Oh, I would not miss it for the world.
By the way, it's Ross.
Hi Ross. I love what you did with this space.
Thanks a lot.
How hot is it?!

Guess who is here. He's the toughest guy in the toy country, Ben. "A true American hero
G.i. Joe
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects US oil interests from overseas!
It took me 28 years to find a man with whom I want to spend my life, if I had to wait another 28 years then, I will be 56 years before I can have a baby, and this is just stupid.
That's what's stupid.
I do not need a real man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
And there, there are places where you can go and get that stuff.
Back to the dock?

Hello. How many, how many have you sold?
I will not tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Hey, now! It was an accident, okay.
You are a great scruple.
What is a scrub?
Why do not you look in the mirror, scan.
I do not have any too. I can only watch you.
It's okay girls and man. Let's see your final comments. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, very nice.
Not pretty enough.
Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
So, how were the lasagna?
Really?!
Good.
So you owe me three nice things.
Yes, I thought a lot about you too.
I know.
This whole platonic thing is difficult.
It's a word!
Yes, I think it's better this way. Yes, we are intelligent. Yes I'm sure.
Are you really sure?
I'll call you back.

So, are you really going out with that nurse?
Well, you and I are just joking, I thought, why do not you joke with him.
You know, I do not know if you've ever looked at the term joking in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care about each other and have fantastic sex and just want to spend more time together.
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that you are made to do, then we must, you know, get my original dictionary.
I'm
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? OK then
Know when to stop.
You know, I felt I had to stop. So are we okay?
Yes. All right, I'm going to tell Dan that it will not happen. Do not do the dance
Right!

Ouch! -Ow! -Ow! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! You know, ow!
Hey! Hey! What is going on?
He broke my arm.
He touched my girlfriend.
No, first he touched mine!
It's my job!
Are you English?
No not anymore.
Why are you shopping here? You do not live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Yes, eh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just taking some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party does barley serve?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends are not as sophisticated as yours.
Where's this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Who's the party?
Of a woman
Which woman?
Chelsea.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here.
Or you're seeing someone behind me, that would make you the biggest idiot on the planet.
Or you're pretending to see someone, which makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal corridor.
So which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be that guy?

Great story again! The yarns that intertwine you! Woo-hoo-hoo!
You know, actually I-I-I should go.
Oh no-no-no! To remain! To remain! Because you-you should-you-should-stay!
Wow. Oh, I'm really flattered, but I do not feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, it's not-no-no-no!
Did you just hit me?
OK, well, you would not let me finish and I was just ... [Monica takes a step back] Ow. That pain [flicks Monica]
Oh! All right. Now, do not do it!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
OK, now I will kick my ass.
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
I know! I know! I know!
Well, now I'll let it go if they both stop.
Well!
Well!
Here we are. You know what, if we were in jail, you guys would be, like, my whores.
OK friend. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I wear everything you own.
My God!
Watch me! I'm Chandler! I could
Yes.
Wow, it's hot with all these things up.
I, ah, I will not do anything, I do not know, lunge.

Hello.
Hello.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about that first.
I do not need to have a game room.
I mean, when I was a kid, I played only those games because I could not have girls, and now I
Stop Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Really?
Yes! Oh yes!
Ohh.
Listen, we do not have to make a guest room, we can think of something with the room together.
This is a great idea! We can
Totally!
We do not have to invent it now.
Oh good.
Yes, and I'm fine with being a pushover.
Is fantastic. Good for you guys.
I'm not high maintenance!
I'm not a pushover!
Who said you were?
You did it!
Oh, I'm shaky. I will say anything

Ok, I know it sounds really stupid, but I feel like if I can do this, you know, if I can really do my laundry, there's nothing I can not do.
It does not seem stupid.
You know, it's like the first time I had to have dinner alone, after Carol left me?
I'm sorry, it's all the time we have.
Come on Ross ... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Uh-oh, oh-oh, the laundry is over.
It is, it's a song.
The laundry song we sing.
Uh-oh the laundry is over, uh-oh, oh-oh.
Ross, what's the problem?
Nothing nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry is over.
Why are you here?
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had problems last time because apparently we ...
No no no ... I mean,
Oh! Someone is a bit irritable today because they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy dimension.
What!?
This was fun! But I have an invasive vaginal examination to get!
I would like to stay, but I have ... I had a hot date ...
Please go! Let me know if you need a hand!
I think he just fell.

I do not want to be single, okay? I alone ... I alone- I just want to be married again!
And I only want a million dollars!
Rachel ?!
Yes.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I will not let it!
And we're not a couple of suckers!
I heard you, Mugsy!
But look, all these rooms are fine?
You can choose one so I can watch - have a magical and perfect weekend with you.
All right,
Anything! It's over! Damn! This is regularly scheduled!
Can we turn off the TV? All right? We really want to spend the whole weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm intruding on changing fun in all the rooms?
Hey, do not blame me for the wig tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice messenger who had to drag the bags in 10 different rooms?
I do not know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada with half a tank of gas!
Do not talk bad about the dead.
We should spend a romantic weekend together, and ... what's wrong with it?
I just want to watch some TV. what's the problem? Damn, relax mom.
What did you say?
I said: "Damn, relaxed Monnnnn".

You know, maybe it's better never to do it again.
Yes, that's what makes that night special. You know, technically we are still
I'm going to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you in a while?
'Kay!
Can I ask you something?
Uhh, no.
Felicity and me, we're watching
No.
I mean, the giant is five years younger than me, you know, do you think I'll ever get there?
Yup.
Thanks man.
Okay, buddy.
But what about what is taller than me?
I mean, there's no way to make me taller now, you know?
And who knows what science will come in the future, but Chandler, and if I die a man of normal size and without success?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for half an hour.
I know!
He had beef tips, eh?

Goodbye and God accelerates, Hope Brady.
Not so fast Wesley!
Remoray!
Exactly, Wesley! I stopped to say that you are not a real doctor! And that woman's brain is fine!
Oh! Thanks God!
Hope! Hope!
Drake!
You are not dying Hope, you will live a long and healthy life. With me.
Oh Drake.
All right!
Here we are!
All right!
Hi, Joey!
It's Rachel!
Umm, I'm free tomorrow night.
Yes, of course, of course I can bring sandwiches.

OK, we got the slap, we got the sandwiches ...
We have minced meat from previously cute cows and turkeys, ew ...
Men are here
Mom, do you relax?
That was 10 blocks from here and, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never have done it.
Mom, come on, stop worrying.
This is a safe road, this is a safe building, there is nothing
Hello.
Hello, hello, can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for Phoebe, do you still live here?
Uh, no, he does not, but I can, I can give you a message.
Great. Uhh, just tell her that her husband was stopped.
What?
Hey, how, how did you do it?

Well, someone.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior college year ... on a pool table.
Whoooaa!
That's my sister.
OK ... my strangest place should be ... the women's room on the second floor of the New York public library.
My God! What were you doing in a library?
Phoebe, and you?
Oh ... Milwaukee.
Um ... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, "It's a Small World After All".
There's no way!
The ride broke.
So, Carol and I went after a couple of those mechanical Dutch children ... then they repaired the route, and we were asked to never return to the Magic Kingdom again.
Oh, Rachel.

Hey!
Hey!
Oh, is the game over?
Yes. Where were you?
Thanks for your patience, you're the next caller.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be crazy.
Nah. I kept busy.
Oh, okay, yes. I put your things in her room and her things in your room.

Well, there is a time. And uh, you know, yesterday.
Yes no, I'm telling you that Rachel has such a nice eye for this stuff.
Ross, you know, if you ever decide you have to repaint ... And I think you should.
You should, you should ask Rachel to help you.
Oh honey, he does not need my help.
Oh come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, how did you call him? The cheap knock-offs and the dinosaur trash.
Really?!
Hey, you know what?
Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here ... here's $ 60, why do not you take Phoebe into your colonial flea market and get me something.
You know what? Not me, I do not think Phoebe really wants to come.
No! I want!
Oh, she wants.
She wants.
Yes!

Wow, you have good feet.
These old things.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadica area, it's killing me today.
You mean siadic-Okay, you mean the towel-covered part.
Yes.
Of course, yes, no, I can do it, yes, because, you know, the muscles in the sdica area can understand it, really beautiful and tight.
So, tell me Rick, how, umm, how did you hurt the area.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Oh.
Ouch! Did you just bite me?
No!

Um, that's it.
No.
Hey!
You!
J.
Crew boy
Yes.
Why did you follow me?
I mean, for the whole week, wherever you look, it's you.
You would not have answered my calls, you sent my letters back ....
What?
One more chance Ursula, please?
All right.

Ok, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music.
Good deal.
Here it is.
Thank you.
Hello!
Hello! All right, let's go shopping !!
Um, you know, before I go ah, there's something I have to say.
Oh ok.
I had a bit of ah, this crush for you.
But since you were with Ross, I-I did not do anything about it.
But now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out.
So-this is-this is what I'm doing now.
Wow! Umm ....
I dropped a cup.

Hello, little embryos.
Well, I'm Phoebe Buffay, bye!
I-I-I hope to be your womb for the next nine months.
You should know that we're doing it for Frank and Alice, you know, you've been there!
Umm, you know that they want you so much, so when you get there, really get it.
Okay, and-and I promise I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to take you home, so Oh!
And then, umm the next time you see me, I'm screaming, do not worry, that's what should happen.
Ready?
Uh Huh. Good luck.

We are baack!
Hey!
What are you guys doing together?
Joey and Janice's
Really.
Yes, yes.
We went to a game of Mets, we got some Chinese food and, you know, I love this woman.
You have a friend of the competition.
I came only to give you a kiss, I have to go get the baby, then.
See you later, honey, Chandler too.
You can not stand it yet, do you?
I'm sorry, man, I'm tired, I did it.
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
But look, you know that the good thing is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she.
It was the bat day at Shea Stadium.
You told him to play the gay boxer !!
Well, I could have said Supergay.
You completely screwed him.
Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Because, Monica, the guy is so good, and I really, I really want this part.
Well, if you really want it, really, then it's okay.

So we have to wait for data from recent MRI scans and DNA tests that challenge information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Look at that woman sitting in the pool to get a tan ... so tough and wrinkled, I'm like that
I'm not your brother.
What about my children Drake? Eh !? No!! No!! No! God!
Because we do not try to massage the breast to stimulate the flow.
Are you kidding me?!
It's so frustrating! Why do not you want my breasts?
I do not know! Maybe she's crazy!

Hi Joey, I got some beer for you.
Uh, do not you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen, I'd order a pizza, would you like to share one?
Pizza, eh, it's not like I've never done it before ... ba dum bum cheshhh.
There is something wrong?
All right, all right, let's get this out in the open ok?
You're hot.
I'm lovable
Clearly there is an atmosphere between us.
But we are roommates and it is a huge mistake for us to continue on this path.
Joey ...
Oh no it is not, no it is not. It's a first date. I'm
Oh.
Oh-oh, it will take some!
From the glow of the lamppost outside his apartment.
You know, he closed the curtains to have a pleasant and pleasant conversation with your little sister.
Well, I'm going to bed!

You were so funny with that waiter! You are crazy!
You know, the fangs of the breadstick are always fun.
No, make them fun. You're the fun one!
Uhh, look at Katie, listen, we have to talk.
All right?
Umm, look, I like you.
I-I really, I like you a lot
All right?
But sometimes when you, when you punch me that way, it seems to me that someone hits me with a very small but very
Aww, as if you could hurt yourself. Are you making fun of my size? Do not make fun of me because of my size!

Oh, Joey! Sorry!
They made you head of the department!
No, I can teach one of his advanced lessons! Why did not I take the department's command?
Oh! Hey, Rach, listen, umm
Yes.
I have an important appointment, do you know a good restaurant?
Uh, Paul's Café. They have great food and it's really romantic.
Ooh, great! Thank you!
Yes! Oh, and then you can take it to the next
Sure, you're naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell you
Ooh, I miss going out.
We all go well dressed and go to a luxury restaurant.
I will not be able to do it for so long, and it's so fun!
I mean it's not fun sitting at home and worrying about giving birth to a sixteen-pound baby.
Hey, you know what?
Eh?
Why do not I take you?
What?! Joey, you do not want to go out with a pregnant lady.
Sure!
And we will go out, we will have fun, and we will keep you out of childbirth and from caesareans and giant heads that stretch out
All right! I'm coming with you! I will go! I will come with you
I'll be fun
All right?

Hello!
Hey!
Joey, I have to tell you, I was thinking
Oh, you know, the script is good, and the director is good, and ... and my co-star is good
God, you must tell me what happens tomorrow!
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! Want to read the lines with me?
Myself? Oh, no, I'm not an actress.
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Oh, fuck it, that part is mine!
Right ... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
All right. . Hi Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
I can not believe you married him.
But what choice I had. He was holding my sister in one
So, and we? Everything we feel for each other.
It's over! you
How can I?
Knowing that I will never hold you in my arms, I will not touch your skin, nor will I feel your lips, knowing that I will never make love with you?
How can I accept that ...
I will never be able to kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you now.
Kiss Me.
What?

Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you have the biggest half. What did you want?
The biggest half.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Brindo here, ding ding.
I know this is not the kind of Thanksgiving you all planned, but it was really great for me, I know, I think because it did not involve the divorce or the projectile vomit.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you had gone to Vail, and if you had been with your family, if you did not have syphilis and stuff like that, we would not all be together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very grateful that all your thanks have been sucked.
It's so sweet.
Hey, here's a bad Christmas.
And a lousy new year.
Here here!

Now wait!
Hold on!
Look, look, your daughter and I should leave for our honeymoon tonight, now-now you-you say I'll be at that airport and I hope she'll be there too!
Oh yes, I said Rachel's name, but it did not mean anything, okay?
She is ... she's just a friend and that's it!
That's all!
Now tell Emily that I love her and that I can not imagine spending my life with anyone else.
Please promise me that you will tell it.
All right, I'll tell him. Come and make a bugger face!
Call me.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, because you never leave the bloody window!

What happened?!!
Well, I do not know!
We fell asleep! That's all.
Yes. Yes. Yes. All right, well, I'd better go.
I think it would be better.
Yes. All right, I'll talk to you later.
All right. But not on this!
No! Never! Never! Hello.
Do not touch! Do not touch!

Umm lady, do you have a minute? I have bad news. I do not think I can transfer to Tulsa.
What?
It's a funny story, actually.
I fell asleep during the meeting this morning, so when I said I would move to Tulsa, I did not really know what I was saying.
You fell asleep?
But just because I've been up all night worried about this meeting, is not it fun?
Irony?
Not a fan, all right.
See, here's the thing.
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she will not go.
See, I love Tulsa!
Tulsa is heaven!
Tulsa is Italy, please do not let me go there!
Chandler, I ...
No no no!
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
Why, why should I call you Elaine?
Oh what a beautiful picture of your son, holding up!
This is a picture of your daughter, it's not like that, well, it's adorable.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.
I'll call you from Tulsa.

Hello.
Hey.
How are you?
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue is my color. How did you know I was here?
Because ... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card that you were using.
Which I did not expect.
I want you to know, I did not let you in.
Oh. Thank you.
No thanks! You gave me so much! I mean, if it were not for you, I would never have sung
Well, actually, you just sang "Memo".
I can not believe you're here.
I mean, what will I do without you?
Who will make the embassy parties collapse with me?
Who will take me to the
Uh ... Oh, Mindy, you're so stupid. Oh, we're both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Family smell?
Oh no
Oh, I'm so sorry.
No, I'm so sorry ...
Oh my.

Well, I have no way to give it a try.
Maybe they can take the needle and stick it in your mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Doctor, can I see you for a minute, please? My brother has a slight phobia on needles.
Did you tell him about my idea of ​​the thquirt pistol?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there is a way to treat it orally.
No, in these circumstances it must be an injection, and it must be now.
Tho?
Ohhh.
All right, sit down.
The doctor says it must be a needle.
You just have to be brave, okay?
Can you do it for me?
Ok.
Ok. Oh boy. You're doing so well. Do you want to squeeze my hand?
Yup!
All right.
All right, Ross, do not hold it so tight.
Honey, really, do not squeeze that much!
Oh, Ross!
Let my hand go!

You'll love me so much I got tickets for Sting !!
My God! I love you! How did you do?!
Well let's say
Oo, where are the seats?
Uh, middle balcony.
You're a bad old woman.
No! Wait no! Shut up, I mean do not cry! Let me have my checkbook!
Look, baby, you do not have to do it, okay?
It's the strength you have inside that means more to me.
You are loyal, you are honest and you have integrity!
This is the kind of strength I want in the man I love!
This does not mean anything to me. Come on!

Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
: Hey.
: What are you doing?
Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It is a bit old but
: No! You're clogging up the chute I've spent a half-hour detox!
I'm sorry. I have not ... I do not come here very much.
: Oh yes, of course not!
No.
: Because you're a little princess! "Dad, buy me a pizza, dad, buy a candy factory, dad, make the cast
I have never said that.
: You think you could mess and the big man in coveralls will come in and clean it, eh?
Well, why not think about someone else for a change?
Ok I'm sorry.
Hello!
What is this?
Oh, just that girl's phone number.
Yes, yes, here it is, just a phone number that gave me a very sexy girl.
It's not a big deal, I mean, it's your home phone number, but ... Whoa!
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
Yes, the beautiful Amanda gives me her number and I - I'm going to let it go.
Thank you.

I do not know how any of these has been opened ?!
Did you open them all?
I know! I know! I'm a terrible person! I mean, Chandler will never trust anything with me again!
Oh hey! You have the gift of my parents!
Yes. What is that?
Well, I do not know. I think I do something for salami.
Hey! How did it go?
Yes. What-what did Tag say?
Tag is not the father! And does Joey know now?
I'm Rachel. I know, and I'm so happy for you.
Oh wow, you did not even try to unplug my bra!
So will you ever say who it is?
No, I will. I'm not up to tonight.
Hey Rach, listen, no matter what this guy says, I want you to know that you will not be alone in this.
I'm not?
Listen, I'm a scary world, especially if you're a single mother.
You know, I've always felt that you and I have this ... a special bond.
You know?
So, Rachel Green, will you marry me?
Thank you.
If I can not have it you can not have it!

I can not believe it, you know, it's just ... it's so typical.
Now Monica, I know you're angry, but do not forget.
There will be a wedding, you are about to launch the bouquet, and
Paris?
We will take a moonlight walk in the Rue de la.
Keep talking.
Then we'll sprinkle the pink pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
I love you!

Yup!
I win again!
Ha-ha!
It's like $ 500 you owe me!
Whoo-ho-hoo!
$ 500 which is a loooot of electricity!
Whoo-ho-ho!
I have to buy some food.
Ok, give me a chance to win my money back. All right? Sudden death, a goal, $ 1,000.
Are you serious?
Oh yes!
Ok, get ready to have me!
All right.
Ok, here we are. Ready?
No! No! No! Nobody can beat me.
To see? Now, that's why only fake little men should be kicked.

Who is that?!
Do not worry, I'm brave!
I am brave!
I am brave!
No-no-no-no !!
Can you tell me who is there please?
Hello!
Hello. Do you know what time it is?
It's candy time! My roommate says they taste like little drops of paradise.
Oh please! Did you hear it? Small drops of paradise.
4:00 AM.
So, can I get some candy?
I'm sorry, but some of us must
Umm, listen, I'm sorry, but first I'll put something out in the morning.
All right, I'll go later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.
Mm! It seems I would have remembered you!
Mm! Night Gar '!

Aaron! You must let me go. The boy is hammered!
I'm sorry, Joey, as long as he's here and he's aware that we're still shooting.
Do you happen to have a very large fork?
So, I just talked to the director. That's all, we ended up for the day.
Well, did we finish the scene?
Yes! You've been wonderful.
As you were.
So I took your car, it's right outside.
Why? We finished for the day?
This is what you told me.
Oh thanks. You are welcome.
No-no-no! We have to go! Come on! Here we are.
Is it my ass?

What about these? These seem equal?
Definitely!
Not like each other!
Oh, then no.
Hey!
Hello!
Are you ready?
Yes.
You look amazing. I am the luckiest man in the world.
Oh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Show me the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings
They look good! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend has really good taste!
Thank you for choosing the earrings man.
HM-mmm.

I know there's no hole there, I really liked that picture.
My God! Watch this!
Ok, but there
I do not care! The threads are loose in your head!
I just thought that if I could follow the thread I could find out what he did.
And you ?!
No. Disappear behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought he had gone downstairs.
But it was not so. Greet Mrs. Chatracus.
My God.
Hi dear.
Hi, Mrs. Chatracus.

Ok, are all clear? We will take it and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We will do it
Ross, I really do not think so
Lift!! And slide!
Ok, here we are.
All right, get up! And slide !!

All right, Carl, we're next. Now remember, what will not be?
Another
Quite right! And what will you not do?
Well, I will not talk because
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but
Oh my God, I understand.
I - I'm so sorry, I go.
Goodbye Monica, I wish you a happy life with him.
Chandler, you call me when this enters the cop.

Yes?
I found my twin identical to one hand!
Ohh, you are
No!
But she has just arrived here!
That was Joey!
I wonder where she is. It's so strange
Yeah, well, he's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop it?
Want to know the first thing he said when he returned from his lunch with Richard?
He felt nothing for him.
She loves You!
Really?
Yup! Now, he feels terrible! She really wants to wear makeup! You must find it.
All right.
Good. I really should start wearing hats!

I mean, why should I let him meet?
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all on him.
I mean, they're like coyotes, taking the weak members of the herd.
Listen.
As someone who has seen more than his good dose of bad beef, I'll tell you: it's not such a terrible thing.
I mean, they're your friends, they're just hunting you.
I know. I only hope that once, I would bring home a boy whom they really liked.
Well, you realize that the chances of this happening are a little thinner if they can not meet the guy.

No-no-no-no. Hey!
Anyway, I should go. OK Bye.
Hey honey.
Hi sweetie. So, what was that whispering?
I can not tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people should not have secrets from each other. We have too much love and respect for each other.
Awww. But still not.
No, I'm serious, we should tell each other
Really? Okay, so why do not you tell me what happened to Ross Junior a
Oh no-no, I can not do it.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
All right.
All right.
So, Ross and I are going
My God. Did he vomit?
No, he visited a small town south of throwing up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson of Phoebe's old massage center gets fired.
That's all?! I gave up on mine
Quite right! Lose the sucker !! Please, however, marry me.

Ahhh! Ooh nice!
My God!
Oh hey! How was your audition?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just making you explode because I'll become a great movie star!
Oh! You got it right?!
Well no, not yet. But the audition went really well.
What was it for?
Oh, it's this big budget movie about these three Italian brothers who arrive in America towards the end of the century.
It's really classy!
Oh, and the director should be the next Martin Scorcese.
The next one?
Yes, there's this guy from Chicago who should be the next Martin Scorcese, all right?
But then this guy is right behind him.
Hello!
They loved me!
My God!
Are you kidding me? I've never rented a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay, let me call you back.
What's up?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Wow!
I know! My grandma will see this!
Grandma will have to get in line.

Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
What? Of course I did it! You are sitting near Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
Oh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I had a nickname.
As if the boy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh yeah. So, do you have a nickname for me?
Umm, no. No.
Yes, you did it! What was that?
Umm, I'm Cutie McPretty.
Ohh it's so sweet!
Listen, I have to tell you, I'm enjoying a world!
You know how you said it could be weird, the whole thing about the student teacher, and to be honest, I thought it would be too much, but it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Burt!

Ok, so we got other good waste, many things to work on.
Ok, shoot.
Ok, oh, the zoo spot.
I did not get it?
No. They said that "I was not credible as a human being". So, you can work on it.
Ok, what else?
Um, the off-Broadway theater people said, "You were pretty but stupid."
Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, it's 'pretty stupid'.
Hey.
How's the maniac?
Oh, well, it's very good. We had a little kiss.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's no longer involved in that stuff. He left for me.
Phoebe, this guy was obsessed with your sister, who knows how long, okay, do not give up.
Look, he gave me his night vision glasses and everything.
Are you taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
What, he is not following her yet. Do you think he's still following her?
Phoebe, wake up and smell the restraining order.
What are you saying I should do?
I think if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thanks, Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Oh, that's what I would do, I'll forget mine.

Hi guys, take a look! My mother sent me the paper!
Ooh, let's see!
Ahhh.
Ah!
Are not you crazy, are you?
No.
So what's up?

There he is!
There is our star!
So, then, what did you think?
Almost as perfect as the one with the two naked girls on the swing.
I-I was not in that.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian woman who lives in mine.
So you know?
The postman was downstairs, so I contacted your mail.
Oh good. Thank you.
Now what is Fabutec?
Ok, okay, do not judge me too much.
All right?
Um, but I've seen this info-merciale, and, um, I swear to you that I've never bought anything on TV before, except for this rag.
But there was this stuff on the waxing of the legs, simply, it seemed so incredible ....
Waxine !!
Yup! Have you seen it?
Oh, it's incredible! I really want to be a Waxine girl.
I know!!
God. Do you really think it does not hurt? Why how can they do it?
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rainforest!
They have the best things in there.

Comin through. Move, move.
Oh, 'excuse me. I was using that car.
Yes, well, now you're not a bit.
But I saved it. I put my trash can on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, is it your basket? It's really pretty Unfortunately, I do not see foam.
What?
No suds, no rescue. Ok?
What is happening?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my car.
Was your basket at the top?
Yes, but there was no foam.
So?
Well, you know, no water, no hello.
No foam? Excuse me, wait a minute. This is my friend's car.
Hey, hey, hey, his stuff did not fit.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Because it's a good price! But this does not change the fact that it is an evil bloodsucker!
Well, I think this is a great place to work!
Ok, are they listening?

Varrrrrroom!
Hey!
Look at you lady!
Varrrrrrrrrrom!
Hey-hey, look good!
Varrrrrrrrroom.
All right, I'm leaving.
My bed is so boring.

Ross you realize that this is the first time in my life that I'm doing something that I really care about.
This is the first time in my life that I'm doing something I'm really good at.
I mean.
if you do not get it ...
No, bye, I got it, okay, I had that great moment.
And I'm happy for you, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your voice mail!
Ok, I do not know what to do anymore.
Well, me too!
Hey!
I'm sorry, I'm late, I missed something?
Joey stuffing 15
15? Your personal best! (Ross takes one
Where were you?
Oh, on an appointment. Yes, I met this girl on the train going to a museum in the north of the state.
Oh yeah! How did you meet her?
Oh, what museum?
No, answer to his.
Ok, it was just me and her on the back of the train, and I sat by the door, so she would have to pass by me if she wanted to change the car.
He was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were drooling this woman?
No, I'm coming back because he lives in Poughkeepsie.
It sounds really fantastic, but it's absolutely fantastic, but it's two and a half hours away.
How can it be great if it comes from Poughkeepsie? That joke would kill Albany.
Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?

No, there's no way! can he
Because it's your family
He can not play at our wedding!
I mean, everyone will leave!
I mean, come on, it's just noise!
It's not even a song!
If you listen very carefully, I think it is

Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
So you think these images ... Are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, sure, of course.
I mean, as in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she is screaming, 'Where am I, where am I?'
Well, he will not find them lying on the grass like that.
Oh yeah. Aw, do you remember the days when you went to the barn, did you get up on your shirt and bend?
Yes.
See, now, go out with this girl.
She's pretty, she's in the open air, you know, and she knows how to light a fire.
I mean, this must come in handy
Ok, I have a question. If I had to choose one of us to date, who would it be?
I do not know.
Me neither.
Rachele.
What?!
I do not know. Me neither.

Look, I wanted to tell you that ... I'm sorry you lost.
Listen, I have a secret for you. I let him win.
It's a secret or a lie.
No, I let him win, Ross!
Yes?
Would you tell her I let you win, please?
Oh. Yes. Uh Chandler
I am strong! I'll show you!
Chandler please!
Oh what is it? You are scared?
Let's go big bunny!
All right. 1 2 3-Go! I will kill myself!

Hey, Ross, is Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh, that's why they call him Staten
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Wow! Do you realize that we threw this ball without letting it fall for an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yes. I realized about half an hour ago, but I did not want to say anything because I did not want to unlucky him.
Wow! We're pretty good at this! Hey! We completely forgot lunch!
Oh, me-I think it's the first time I miss a meal! Yes, my pants are a bit loose!
Hey guys
Hey!

Who is it?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey!
Oh God. So, you're making porn movies.
No I'm not.
You're doing one now!
IS-
Yes, can I help you with something?
Look, I'm talking right now! You ... you mean her.
You know, twin things are always a great seller.
What?!
Yes, I can talk to you to give you 30 dollars.
No!!
There's no way!
No!
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!
And shame on all of you!
You're disgusting!
Above all with you!

Hey!
Hi Phoebe!
Are you going out?
No, these are not all my bags. This is from Paul.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a second?
Well, of course ... just a second, though, because Paul is coming.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Phoebe, Phoebe ...
Ok, we have not known each other for a long time and ... there are three things you should know about me.
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best raisin cookies in the world.
Ok, thank you Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted them before ?!
Oh, I do not do them a lot because I do not think it's right for the other cookies
All right, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which shows that I never lie down.
I guess you do not do it.
Paolo made me a passage.

I'm so sorry. Please stop going crazy.
I'm not going crazy.
Why should I be out of my mind?
A woman named Heldi called and said we would get married, but this happens every day.
Honey, we were in this beautiful place, and I_I_I put down our names for fun!
I mean, what's the damage in this?
Right here!
Chandler, please do not think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
Phoebe and Rachel!
So the people who knew our marriage before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some bands called Starlight Magic 7 that are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please do not take this to say anything, because it does not.
All right.
Really?
Yes, if it really does not mean anything, because you know I'm not ready
I know! I know.
All right.
I'm going to tell Joey that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Hey, did you buy it?
Totally.
So Heldi showed you the place?
Yes, it's beautiful.
I can not believe you'll ask Monica to marry you!
I know.

No Phoebe!
You can not take the phone like that; it's not right!
Okay, I have an idea.
Because we do not do it, because we do not see what kind of number it has on its speed dial, and from that moment we can say who has more in common with him.
And then who takes the phone.
Or, we can decide based on the name that is never closer to the word phone.
I do not think so
All right, but I bet you'd be singing another song if we were arguing over a ratchet.
All right, the name on the speed dial is mom.
Oh, I lost my mother for suicide.
Okay, no, you can not use it to get the cute boy and the last blueberry muffin.
Have I used it today? I'm sorry.
Yes it's okay.
Well, now you see this is not telling us anything.
Joe.
Carlos.
Peter.
Ooh!
Peter Luger!
It's a steak house!
Ok, a meat eater. Well, this is for you.
Oh, I win! He has
So you do not know it
His new girlfriend!

I can not believe. Do you think your parents could help pay for this?
I do not know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth marriage.
He's saving the rest for his divorce.
And all the extra money my father has for his annual trips
Well, what happened to dinner?
My parents spent the money on our wedding!
My God! What did you order ?!
Wait, but there is no money! Well, this is terrible! You guys should marry you like a, rec. center!
Darling you'll be okay.
No! No it is not! It will not be good! It sucks! No swing band! No lily!
No, you know what?
It'll be fine.
I mean you do not have to have this rustic Italian party.
You know?
And-and you do not need, you do not need this tailor-made, imperious life, duchess, satin dress; you can wear the rack.

Dr. Geller, there is a place here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having lunch at this table here in the middle.
I'm having lunch here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
You know, we work in a museum of natural history, yet there is something unnatural about the way we have lunch.
Now, I look around in this cafe, and you know what I see, I see - I see a division.
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself: "My God why?"
Now, I say we release them - these coats that separate us, and we know the people below.
I'm Ross!
I'm divorced and I have a baby!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I do not know the dinosaur squat!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
All right, here you are!
Yes, you stayed in Teddy!
I'm Andrew, and I have not paid for this pear.
All right, good for you.
I'm Rhonda, and these are not real!
Wow, Rhonda.
I'm Scott.
Yes, ok, Scott!
And I need to turn the light switch on and off 17 times before leaving a room or my family will die.

So thanks for the warm welcome.
It's nice to have guys on my team and I come to play.
I hope you do it too.
Now, let's go out there and get them!
Eh?
And remember, there is no "I" in the team.
Yes, but there are two in martinis, so everyone
You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Oh, it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry, I was just ah ...
No-no, I heard what you said, funny.
I like fun
This team talks about hard work, but it's also about having fun.
It's nice to have you on Bing!

Yes. You will not be able to take it.
So, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what will they call her?
They will call her Chandler.
It's a masculine name, do not you think?
It works on you.

Oh, it's so sweet.
No, no, ok, hang up.
Ok, ok, one, two, three.
Well, you did not even hang up.
She did not hang up too ...
Ok, no, no, hang up. You, you, you
Ross, hi, I'm Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that um, everything is fine and I'm really happy for you and yours
Rachel, I received a message from you.
My God.
Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.
.
.
Are you on top of me?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
What ... are you, are you, are you above me?
Ohh, ohh.
When, when were you ... under me?
Well, basically, lately, I've got a kind of feeling for you.
OK, I need to lie down

Hey! I'm in, they'll let me audition!
Really? Is fantastic!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting women saw me in a comedy, so I moved away from her
(noting a child who has collected a copy of
Oh yes, yes! He did a lot of publicity. I saw it as Sugar Smacks,
Yes, well, he will not take it
Ben is so much nicer than that guy.
I mean look at it, look at it,
Is fantastic. Listen, would not it be nice if I could play Ben's father?
Joey, do not look like Ben.
I look more like him than you!
You know, I do not know you well enough for you to do it.

This was really your best job.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can not believe I have only two hours before you call sick for work.
I have to be awake in seven minutes.
Well, you will not believe it, but if you have seven minutes
Really?!
Do you want?
All right! Get the vacuum cleaner and I receive the furniture polish!

Oh ok. But you know what? Watch out. Because a guy who was helping me first had to leave because he hurt his back.
Fiance?
No.
I'm Joey.
Kristen.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! Again?
Kristen.
Done! So
So, do you live around here?
Yes!
Yes!
Right over there.
Hey listen; let me give you a little advice
Do not take a nap like this or you can wake up with the missing shoes.
I will remember it.
All right. Yes. Listen, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
What about tomorrow?
It looks fantastic! Ok, all right, well, where are you going?
You are strong, because I do not take it and take one of the boxes.
All right. Yes. Yes, I will take this.

Hey.
Listen, um ...
I'm sorry.
: Yeah, uh ... You know, you should just forget what I said under the bridge, I was talking
That's right, I do not ... But I was, I was drunk of you!
Ok, yes, so it will not work.
If it were, will you stop going out with her?
Er, so yes, it's because of Phoebe! So, you know, it's her or me.
You know ... You'll really be very difficult to overcome.

By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see many of me.
Oh, hello liar.
Look, I ... I'm really sorry for letting my bike go.
I could be killed, I hope you know!
I know. I know. But can we try again? Eh? I mean, you were
Well, I'd like to but the bike was stolen and the police have no suspicions.
Phoebe.
What?! What the hell?!
All right, you know what?
If you do not learn to ride this bike, I'm sorry, I'll have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
Why! Because, it's - it's like you had this guitar and - and I never played it. Ok, this guitar
All right. If you care enough to recover that shitload, okay.
Great! Great! You are making the bike very happy.
Ok, Ross! Please do not die!

How could you keep all this from me?
I was about to tell you, but
But what?! You thought you'd get what you wanted and then you downloaded it as you downloaded Rachel!
Hey! I did not download Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just because we do not let the car do it?
Hey, Ross. It's Joey. There's a prostitute here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need, I need to lie down.

Everything about your application looks really good-Ohh!
Just one last question, you and your friends will go here all the time like partying and going out?
Oh, do not worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa !! Now look, do not be just angry. I want you to really think about your answers. All right?
You can call the roommate's search! Hello! I will live here.
Oh, do not listen to him, he's just a guy who really wants the apartment, but I do not think he'll understand that.
Why did you lower the shower curtain?
That thing was dangerous! I am very attentive to safety.

Hello.
Hey buddy, how did the audition go?
Estelle said I did not understand it.
What?! Why? Joey, you were so ready for this!
Yes, I thought so too, but you said that the casting members had some trouble with me.
No!
As far as I know, he's trying to find me, but I could not because I kept moving.
No, from now on, I'll stay in one place.
Right here.
Well, it's getting late.
Yes, we will go.
In fact, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Uh, you know, we have to get up early and get that plane to New York.
Yes, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
But we will stay here with you.
Thank you guys! I appreciate it a lot, you know, but you do not have to rub my ass.

Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
I'm not a couple!
Oh, ok, I have the game now.
Ok look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it really hot?
Oh yeah!
All right, so you're fine.
The rule is when two actors are making him off stage, all the sexual tensions between them are gone.
All right?
So as long as it's hot on stage you have nothing to worry about.
It's when the heat goes out, it's when you're in trouble.
Really?
Listen, you guys have been to every opera I've ever been to, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
No.
Noooo !!

Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. OK Bye Bye
Wait a second! So, what's new with you?
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.
And your breasts! Hmm !!!
All right.
Umm, you're getting a bit strong.
But I will give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems that the universe really wants to be together.
So, why do not we start all over again?
And you can only tell me about you.
All right.
All right.
I write erotic novels for children.
What?!
They are wildly unpopular.
My God!
Oh, you might be interested in knowing I have a Ph.D.
Wow! You do?
Yes, a lot 'huge
All right.

So, how are you?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How are you mum?
Myself? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ... What are your hair?
What?
What's different?
Anything.
Oh, maybe that's it.
It's incredible, our mother is ...
Ok, relax, relax.
We'll be here for a while, it seems, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh God!
The small mind blurred at the bottom of the bag.
Oh!
... Yes, they were disgusting.
Oh, do you know what I loved?
His sweet 'n' Los.
As he was always stealing from restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from our home.
Could be.
You can not!
Why? Seriously I did not understand a word you said.
In the room.

Now, you, most people, when their pets pass, want them to be as if they were sleeping.
But sometimes you get your person who wants them posing.
Like, chasing the tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I want to look for my keys.
That's a good one!
Hey, Joe.
Dad, Ronni is here.
Eh?

So now, these are all the tuxedos we create and if there's anything you like, we can make a deal.
Just nothing.
But these are the three that Monica has pre-approved.
Well, thank you very much for keeping me company. I want you to know that I want you to participate in our marriage as my guest.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. All right? Do not try to pin blue me!

Oh, here, I think it's us. Yes.
Limited to sit in my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hello!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know about the bride and groom?
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I have not been invited! A
Stop saying "Blood" to strangers.
So, and you? How do you know the happy couple?
Ok, you're fine.

Monica, why did you bring me here from all the places?
You will see.
I tell you, this marriage will not happen.
Oh God.
All right? But ... but imagine many more lights, ok? And you know less bricks, and-and-and flowers and candles
And the musicians, look, they can go here, okay? And the chairs can handle this way, and you go.
But, if you do not love him, we'll do it anywhere else at any other time.
Really, all right, whatever you want.
It's perfect.
And, I do not know, if it starts to rain
Well, then we'll get wet.
Ohh. And I do not even have an appointment.

Coming.
I have a bone to choose with you.
Uh Oh.
Yup! Ben has learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? He pulled the old man
Quite right! Quite right!
Oh that.
Yes! You know I hate practical jokes! They are bad and they are stupid and I do not want my child to learn them!
You know what? It does not matter! Because it's not true!
All right.
And if it were true, how
Mrs. Monroe Oh, here you are.

Mark is a genius!
Why?! Such as?! How is a genius?
Look, you do not understand what's going on here.
Instead of beating her right away, she is becoming her confidant.
Now it will be the guy who goes to complain about you too.
What am I going to do?
Well, why do not you send her a musical bug, op, you have not already.
All right, you have to go to you now, okay, take a surprise visit.
I do not know you guys.
All right, do not do anything, sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she's talking to you about you.
And it's Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because she understands me.'
And before you know it, she's with him.
And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
And he will be everything, 'Yes!'
And we, we will be like "Wh-whoa, friend".
And very soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii', and, and, and, 'I can not go, Rachel and Mark could be there.'
And we'll be like, 'Man recovers, it's been four years!'
He rather paints a picture, does not he?

This is what I have done so far for the party, wise liquor. Take a lot of liquor.
Great. Great.
Okay, now, as far as the list of invitations is concerned, I've got you, Chandler and me, and I'll invite Gunther because, well, we've talked about this pretty hard.
I will be there.
All right, oh!
Listen, I know this is your party, but I really would like the number of museum buffs there will be.
Yes. Tell me what, we do not invite any of the anthropologists, just the dinosaur guys!
All right! We'll need a six-piece package
Hi guys, what are you doing?
Hey, you know what, if you do, if you call him Joey, you should call him Chandler.
Oh come on!
Chandler is fun, sophisticated, and he's very lovable, once you know him.
Oh well, hey, Joey is lovely too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, well, it might be a bit late, but ... but it will be there.
And it will bring you some cold soda, if you want me to need it, you're really hot.
What do you say? What do you say?
Well, I like the idea of ​​naming him as someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are big names.
But, alright, not ... maybe I'll just call him Hulk.
I knew I should not have said it! This is what I wanted to call my son!

What Rachel did to his life ... We ran into his parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I will not tell you what they spent on that wedding ... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least you had the chance to leave a man at the altar ...
What should it mean?
Anything! It is an expression
No it is not.
Do not listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you've always been!
Even when you were a child ... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were fine!
And you will read alone in your room, and your riddles ...

PBS Telethon.
Hi Joey.
Hey, Phoebe!
I
$ 200? Are you sure about Phoebe? I mean, after what
Oh, I'm still angry with them but even now that they bring happiness to so many children that mothers do not kill themselves, so supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
What kind of problem?
Well, to tell you the truth, they had a problem with the bag!
My God!
Nooooo!
You know what? It was still a stupid comedy!
You know, Joey, I think it's time to leave the bag.
I do not want to give up the bag.
I do not have to give up the bag!
I'm doing Rach?
Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey, wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean it as terrifying as I think you're with it
Oh hey!
I do not know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can not believe I hear it!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I'm not saying you should not have a bag, just ... there are other bags that are a little less humble, controversial.
Yes, they are called portfolios.

I think you will find this room more to your liking.
Ok, fantastic.
They say that only half a tank remained.
Half tank? We still have a lot of high-speed pursuits to do!
We are changing rooms.
What? Why?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Our last room with an ocean view was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you here for a second?
Uh Huh.
Chandler!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey !!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey !!
Oh. Oh, really ... did I wake you up?

Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was going to leave. I-I-I-I did not think you were coming.
Oh, do not lose this.
Well, I'm very happy you're here.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my house!

Hey!
Hey-hey.
So are the boys okay?
Yes, we talked and Monica made me realize that I reacted a bit and some things in life are more important.
Do you have a minute?
Well yes, of course, what's up?
I was invited twice today when I was at lunch as a child.
Oh really?!
Yes. Did you tell anyone I was gay?
Oh, did not you want people to know?
But I'm not gay. And above all I would not want you to think I was gay.
Why?
I do not think I should say.
Oh, you can say. Come on, I do not want you to feel that you can not tell me things.
All right.
'Kay.
Well
Yes.
I'd like to ask your friend Phoebe.
Yes, he's gay.

Here it is.
Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
Great!
Hey Hey Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. We'll go out tonight.
Go out, eh? Wow! Wow! So things did not work with Kathy, eh? Bummer.
No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having dinner with her tonight, right after my first dinner with Casey.
What?
Yes, yes. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza alone!
Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Yes. Why are you getting so angry?
Well, I'm angry for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be really unsatisfactory for you.
what's the problem? It's not that we are exclusive.
Listen, Joey, Kathy clearly does not meet your emotional needs.
But Casey, I mean I just saw the back of her head, but I got the feeling she's ... she's smart, and funny, and she takes you.
Do you have all this from the back of your head?
Ok, I think it's time for you to settle down. You know? Make a choice, choose a lane.
Who is Elaine?

Can you not see me?
So, will you talk to him?
I do not know Rach.
Oh come on! I'll give you ten for free
One! No ten! You said ten! You can not take it back!

Hey!
Hello!
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your TV?
We need a porn break.
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Well, then, why do not you turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off porn for free.
Ooh, well, you heard! All right.
Hey!
Hello!
Well, what? Has Cha arrived there?
Oh, well, I'm glad you asked.
Now, do not you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with a normal steak knife?
Ahh!
Now, I know what you're thinking
Does the pregnant woman play at four?
Phoebe, they did not charge you knives, did you?
No!
Are you sure?
No!
Honey, you will not earn enough money to help Frank and Alice simply by selling knives.
No, no, I know, but I have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
What is the second part of your plan?

You are right.
Why?
I'm tired of attacking two women, it did not work.
What?!
No, I mean, it's all right, I mean, I'm ... they're my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, did you attack your ex-wife ?!
Oh, no!
Ninth!
No I am tired!
But I could not.
That's why I'm here.
Maybe we could attack them together?
That ... that's a no.

What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
Friend, if you come back, you'll be Dead Ross!
I do not care! I'm not quitting! I insist to finish this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing it, let me help you at least.
No, God no! It is not a place for a woman. Those guys will take something.
No. That's not what I'm saying. I could just know some things that could help you inflict pain.
I like it.
Yes? Listen carefully, Devon has a weak ankle.
Eh?
A quick kick and he will pull back.
All right, ugly ankle, get it!
And that big guy with a beard has a deceptive hip.
Yes.
And uh, and David over there, I heard he does not bring a cup.
Yes? I can use that, joking hip, no cup, okay! All right!
And you, Liam, Liam has bad knees. You hit him on the right and he will come down like a lamp.
But ... but Liam is on my team.
I do not care! Just take it!
I'm going to get it! Ok, I'll go back inside!
The Red Ross! All right.

Oh! Oh by the way?
Uh-hmm.
James Brolin?
Oh I know. I could only think of two names, he and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he was gay.
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?!

Hello?
Hi, is Ross there?
No it is not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce attorney, just told him that since I did not hear from him, I assume he decided to try marriage.
Ross remarried - Nooooooo !!!!!!!!!

Oh, oh! Ok, he's kicking up!
Oh! It's growing inside of you.
Whoa !!
Oh!
Wow, it was great.
I think it's the youngest girl to ever refuse me.
Oh hey guys!
Of course, I can go out until I have to meet you. What ... How come you're not going?
I have a job interview so I have to be ready.
I thought you already had a job.
And people say they do not pay attention.
No, this is a much better job.
He is vice president of a company that performs data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do it?
This is what I do now.
Hey, Joey, come and taste this.
What is that?
Do you remember that guy who gave me a bad review? Well, I'm taking revenge!
Did you cook it?
No.
He teaches a course of food criticism at the New School, so before going to the cinema I want to go there and let him try my bouillabaisse again.
Oh, I can not wait to read the first page of the Post tomorrow!
"The restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
The first page? You really live in your little world, do not you?

So, did you find someone who marries you guys again?
No, but Horny called Monica, to find out if we were still together.
We will never find anyone.
Well, let me do it!
Joe
No-no-no!
Look, I was thinking about it.
I'm a real actor?
So I will not get nervous talking about people.
Joey looks really sweet
No-no-no-no look no!
I will not spit and I will not stare at Monica's breasts!
You know?
Everyone knows I'm a donkey!
This is true.
Yes, and the most important thing is that it will not be a bit like it, a stranger up there that barely knows you.
I'll be me!
And I swear I'll do a great job.
Besides, you know, I love you and ... and that would mean a lot to me.
You know, we have not found anyone else.
It could be a bit cold.
So can I do it?
Ah-ha! Too arrogant!

I still can not believe they took my key away. You trust me with yours.
Of course I do it! And I'll give it back to you as soon as they've finished it at the key point.
What the hell is that?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
You said there was a gas leak here.
Well, why do not you use your key?
Because when I find it on this thing, the whole place could have exploded.
If it happens in another building I manage, people will start asking questions.
Come on!
Hurry up.
Oh! We could have done it.

Fortunately, the guy he's adapted to can not hear what you're talking about.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Um, and maybe I'm wrong!
But, you know, I'll go out with him again, I'll find out more.
Do you think this guy is destined for someone else and will you keep going out with him?
Well, it may not be my soul mate, but a girl has to eat.

(going up with this
God Ross, what is it?
Oh, but it made her so happy.
The girl is missing her cat.
Mad thinks that her mother is in a cat.
Okay, you know what, I have to go to dinner with my son, I can trust you when you see Phoebe, you'll tell him.
Yes.
Thank you.
I
He's right, is not he?
You know what, I think this could be one of the times he's wrong.
You think?
Oh-no, he's right.

Seven hundred dollars!
All right, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, two weeks hell, eh? Do you know what, though? I really feel like I've learned something.
Really? So, will you stick with this thing 'it's all for you'?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man opens his eyes, does he walk like this?

Oh.
You know, those are a delicacy in India.
Me too.
Even if this city is my home, like this.
So it's stupid what I said, do not tell him I said it.
Umm, do something.
Nice thank you.
This is me.
Here.
Your eyes are very cute.
Thanks a lot! Oh! Thank you!
He would like to kiss you.
Okay, you know what, you do not have to do it now.
No-no-no-no !!
Not him, you do not!
Well, the moment is over.
Oh.
Oy!

Hey! Wait a minute, wait a minute. Do you think these pearls are beautiful?
I would really prefer a mountain bike.
Janice's birthday is coming, I want her to have something special. Come here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
Ah, you want to bring her something special, bring her flowers, get candy, get rubber, girls love rubber.
It's a good idea, "Dear Janice, I have a Hubba-Bubba birthday". I'd like to do something serious.
Oh, you want something serious.
You know what you should do, you should take one of those um, barium enemas.
Those died seriously
All right. Look, I'm going here, and you never buy me anything.
No, no, you can not, you can not, okay, you can not, you can not buy its pearls, you can not, you can not, you can not.
Why not?!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, that's the thing, okay, the thing is ...
What is the thing?
All right. I went to the "Mattress King" showroom and I saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?
They were in his office.
Well, she would not do it, she's with, she's with me.
All right!!

I'm telling you that it's like watching Bambi learn to walk.
You're drunk! Mom and dad will become maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Right here! Can we have some here, please? Here we are.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did not I tell you to come directly to me when other crab cakes were ready?
How do you feel?
You
I really wish you did not do it.
Now all you have to do is spend a little more, ok?
Then we can get you to bed, okay?
Just smile and do not talk
Speech! Speech! We hear from the celebrated! Eh?
Phoebe !!
You do not see? Everyone is watching me! The plan works! I did not even have to take my head off!
Speech! Let's go Monica!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
Hey Chandler, you can not keep your hands away for a second!
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
Well, you gotta because maybe it's stupid.
Well, just as Monica and I were dancing with them, it was the first time I knew you were the woman with whom I wanted to dance all my dances.
Oh shit!

All right.
The super could not understand what he did.
A $ 200 an hour electrician could not understand what he was doing.
I had seven pretty serious shocks.
I officially give up.
Thanks God.
I guess Joey was right, he does not do anything.
To see? I'm doing. I'm doing it totally. I lost it.

Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
He has no one.
Yes, we ... we feel a bit responsible.
I can not believe you said woowoo. I do not even say woowoo.
Oh, it's coming! Is coming!
People, when we come back we'll talk about his new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
You may want to put the children to bed for this.
You know, we do not have to look at this.
In no way, forget it.
Come on, it's your mother!
Exactly.
Chandler, I have to tell you, I love your mother's books!
I love his books!
I can not get on a plane without one!
I mean, it's fantastic!
Yeah, well, you would not think it would be nice if you're eleven and all your friends go through page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch'.
Come on, Chandler, I love your mother. I think it's an explosion.
Thank you.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Thank you. Uh Rach?
Yes?
Why does my cinamon stick have a rubber?
Oh! Here because. I'm sorry!

Oh. Oh! Mrs? Excuse me Miss?
Yup?
You can not put a cigarette on a tree!
Yes, I can, it worked really well.
No, but you should not! Do not you ever do it again.
I will not do that! Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Stop punk!
What?!
Yes, it's true, you're so angry. Book 'em.
Who are you talking to?
Save it red! Unless you want to spend the night in jail, you apologize to the tree.
I'm
We apologize with the tree right now or I'm calling for backup. Backup! !! Backup
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Ok, delete the backup! Cancel backup!

Shh! Take me out of here.
Oh.
Ross!
What?
Come here, look at this!
What? Is it the comet?
No! No, no. Look, there's a bug stuck in the tar here.
Joey come - I can not believe it - I'll bring you here to see King Bapstein's comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomena, and all you care about are insects stuck in tar and ... and some women!
You know, there is
Show me where?
Right here.
Joey where is the pipe that held the door open?
I do not know! Yes I do it.
Joey!
What?! All right, hey! Do not look at me! You're the one who wanted to come and look for stupid people
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!

Wow! This place is amazing! The Sting pen he gave Phoebe. Come on! Secret Passage!
Hello!
Hello!
I'm Trudie.
Uh Huh.
You must be Ben's mother.
Why else should I be here?
Sit down
Yes.
Oh Rach is magnificent. Is fantastic.

Hi .. how was the game?
Well..
WE WON!! Thank you! Yup!
Fantastic! I have a question: how is it possible?
Alan.
It was incredible.
It was like that-that-cartoon Bugs Bunny where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was the first base-Alan, the second base-Alan, the third base -...
I mean, it was like he made us a team.
Yes, we certainly showed Hassidic's jewelers a thing or two on the softball.
Can I ask you a question? Have you ever thought that Alan is ... sometimes ...
What?
.. I do not know, even a little Alan?
Well no. It's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Yes, it's his, innate Alan-ness that-that-we worship.
Personally I could have a gallon of Alan.

Well I enjoyed it! I learned to cook, to eat good food, this is the first A I got from the seventh grade,
Oh look! Acting for beginners! Do you want to feel good about yourself?
What the hell!
All right.
Well, let's start with some basics. Can someone tell me what is the difference between the stage and the stage?
Yes, this was a stupid idea.

My God!
These pants are burning!
Oh come on, she wants to curl up now!
What is he trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano in here!
Are you hot?
All right, it must only be me then.
They were just the pants on the sofa. Umm, hello, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
You're driving me crazy with that!
Ok, I'll stop.
Do not stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could do that shot!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You want to play?
Chandler, I can not play, Ross will be home soon.
And I have to write five full pages if I respect his program.
Well, then, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until you get home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we made a quantum leap?
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter.
Ok, but be careful, because I want to get our security deposit back.
Yes, I think we said goodbye when we invented the hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not sprayed?
Uh yes, right here.

Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? All right! How would you like a Tiki Death Punch?
What is that?
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Yes, honey, you would not lose this.
Relax. You're only nine centimeters. And the child is at zero station.
You're really scaring me.
Someone wants to help me, trying to tear my heart out. Uh, it's fantastic. Has anyone seen a nipple?
All right, ten centimeters, here we are.
All right, honey, it's time to start pushing.
But I'm not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can not tell the child to wait for them.
Oh God.

Here we are. Mona umm, I think it's time to talk about where things are with us.
Yes, I think I suggested it.
Aw, we - we are so So, well I - I - I like you and I - I love umm, you can go out with you.
And I mean ... I'm having a lot of fun.
All right.
I mean, it makes no sense to spend time with someone if ... if it's just fun.
Must be, must go somewhere right?
So where ... where is it going?
Ah!
Here ... this is the real question.
And-and the answer is that it's going somewhere funny.
Now I - I know what you're thinking, the fun was good for you like ten years ago, you know, but you're not getting younger.
No, I mean ... No, not you, you, you
I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?
You know what?
I'll take you out to dinner tonight.
I found this place that makes the biggest mozzarella sticks and jalepino popcorn.
No?
Really?
They taste so good.

Drumroll.
All right. All right. All right. Help! Am I a Mark or a John?
Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you could be a good Barney.
All right, I'm serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 am I will go to court.
Are you really doing it?
Hey, look, this name has held me for a lifetime.
Ok, that's probably why the kids chose me at school, and why I never do well with women. So, starting at 4 tomorrow, I'll be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You have problems because of you!
Not your name!
All right, this must end!
Chandler is a great name!
In fact, yes, I am, I'm sorry.
I know you really wanted me to call little Joey, but eh, so, I-I, I'll do it, I'll call little Chandler.
Damn! I thought it would be romantic to die for!
Was.

Look, I just saw my best friends in the brain smeared on the canvas, it will not be me, not me.
Wow! That was good. That was ... Tweezers?
No.
Whoa. It was really good
Thanks, any suggestions?

Hello!
You-did you have sex with Ursula ?!
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she came in and I thought it was you and I kissed her
Did not you notice that he wore different clothes ?!
Well, I was so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! You know what? This is too strange
No-no it is not!
I do not want to lose you!
It's as if I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought I was in you ... Yes, it's too weird.
So I guess this is it.
Yes. Maybe it's for the best. Feel just like her.
Yes, you too.

Hey!
Hello.
So, do shopping make you feel better about Ross?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well,
Can?
Yes. I just need you to bring me some pictures of Ross.
Um-hmm.
And a piece of chocolate.
All right.
Ok, we have to talk. I'm just coming out of a very serious relationship
I know! And I'm just coming out of a wedding, I mean talking about what it means to be!
Right! I just think it's happening too soon.
Oh, too early, too much schmoon. Admit it darling, I will not let you escape this time.
I hear you. But! Unfortunately, my company is moving me abroad!
Oh no! Where is it? Too much Paris?
No! No! No, Paris.
Even in London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
Okay, could you stop talking for a second? Yemen. Yes, yes, I was transferred to Yemen!
When?
I do not know exactly.
Uh, well, I'll just have to dive from Chandler Bing every so far.
But I know it's some time tomorrow.

Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
Great! Go get it.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
He's not really my type.
No, not you, dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what he likes. People tell doctors everything.
But you said he was an exceptional guy!
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then turn out to be the biggest idiots.
You attract some stinking.

Chandler.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're adorable today. And I can say, this is a
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stay in his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen.
If it's about those jokes reminders, I've had nothing to do with them.
Really.
Nothing at all.
Really.
Anything.

You know, when we get together, can I get a gumball machine?
Obviously! Joey would not let you have one?
No. When it comes to desserts, it's surprisingly strict.
Hey, did you find a way to tell him you're moving?
No, no, I keep trying, you know?
I can go out, "Joey, I too" but then I lose my nerve and I always end up with "going to the toilet".
He might think I'm sick.
You know, I just have to tell Rachel, but I just have to finish it!
You know, the next time we see them, we'll tell them.
All right?
That's all.
Oh, so it will work now? Do you want to order me all the time?
Quite.
All right.
Hey Monica!
Hello!
Hey friend, are you feeling better?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
My God! You're pregnant!
Yes, if you get married in Las Vegas, you're only married in Las Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Las Vegas, you're married everywhere.
Really?!
Yes!
OMG! -Oh! Well

See that guy? Now it's in the classics, but you know that as soon as we leave we'll go straight to porn.
He is about to go to the desk with
Yes.
I lost this.
Me too.
So, do you want to get a burger or something?
Yup! Yup! Yup! Yup! Awww!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, you know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We.
Okay, Rachel, you want to put marshmellows in concentric circles.
No,
Every year.

IS
Hey! Ross!
Die Hard
Yes. Hey, what do you think we do a double function?
What did you rent?
Die Hard 2
Joey, this is it
Oh, well, we look at him a second time and his
Joey, us
IS?
And it will be nice to see it again! Yes!
Die Hard
Friend, you did not say
Yes, I just had, I have plans.
Well, John McClane had plans!
No, you see I want to get out of here before Joey gets aroused and starts calling everyone bitch.
What are you talking about? Bitch.

I know you did the wrong thing on purpose.
I can not prove it yet, but when I do, you're going to jail for murder.
I do not care if you're my brother.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your article on the dotted balance in the Devonian era was top notch!
Stop taking a look at my things!
Hey!
Hey!
I just wanted to let you know that I changed my mind: I will, I will kiss Joey.
No you can not! Friends who connect are a bad idea.
Please, and you and Chandler?
It's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Good bye!
What about all the guys you got phone numbers with? Why do not you just kiss one of them?
I could, I could but I do not want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I will do it.
And I can not stop you.
No.
Hey Rachel, did you see Charlie anywhere?
I'm smarter than

Oh, hey, Gunther, take a look.
Yes, that ... that Chandler makes me collapse.
Hey, Ross, listen, you want something to drink, because I'm going up there.
Uh, yes, I'll take a coffee Thanks man.
Sure. Coffee? Because I'm going up there.
No.
No thanks.
You guys need something, because I'm going up there.
I would like an ice water.
You got it right.
Joey, what are you doing?
Simply be friendly.
Joey, honey, I do not think you should go back there.
No, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Do not wink at me. And wear your apron.
Ok, but I can not see you ask any other paying customer to wear aprons.
Joey, do you work here?
No.
Hey, waiter.
Yes?

You have reached Monica and Chandler, if you are listening to this message, we will probably do it. Yes, we are
Hi, I'm Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
I'm calling Monica Geller.
I want to let you know that there has been a cancellation and if you are still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom !!

Thank you.
Thank you.
I can not believe! This is like the worst night ever!
You know, Monica, you had a small setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's just Chandler. I'm
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid topic. I do not even want to see Richard anymore.
So go repair it!
Go find Chandler!
It's probably in your room!
Tell him you're sorry and you love him.
You know what? You're right, Phoebe. You are right. Thank you!
Sure! Yes! Las Vegas, number one!
Does anyone lose it?
Comin out. Place your bet The dice are out. Double or nothing! Pay in the front line!
Hmm.

Do you remember where the duck's food is?
Yes, it's in the boys' apartment under the sink. Why?
Because I'm going to London.
What?! What do you mean to go to London?
Yes, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
Now baby, you take care, you do not have those kids until I get back.
Rachel, you can not go! Ross loves Emily!
Yes, I know, I know, I know he knows.
But I have to tell him how I feel!
It deserves to have all the information and therefore can make an informed decision.
That's not why you're going!
You're going because you're hoping he'll say, "Yes, I love you too, Rach.
Forget that british chippy. "
Ohh, do you think he will do it ?!
No!
Because he's in love with the British Chippy!
Look, Rachel, if you go, you'll get your head wrong and ruin your wedding!
You know, it's too late!
You're lost, you have chances!
I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
You know what? No. It's not over until someone says "I do".
I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it! Uh, how can I really chase you. I'm bringing a litter.

So are everyone here?
I arrived here a little early.
Let's start.
Now, the hydrosaurides have been unearthed in two main places.
Here.
Here.
Now as for the hydrosaurs

Well, so anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is that I should have considered your feelings before I came home with you that night.
I ha, I recently learned what it means to be on your side, and I'm sorry.
So, do you think you can forgive me?
Great.
Thank you.
OK Bye.
Hi, Jennifer?
Oh hello, Mrs. Loreo, is there Jennifer?
Oh, it's not at home eh?
Well, actually, I need to talk to you too.

Hey!
Hello.
Are you OK?
Uhh ... I think I just got engaged.
My God! Did he do it?
Well ... did you know he would ask me?
Are you kidding?
I am like the one who convinced him.
I like to think of myself as the puppeteer of the group.
And do you really think it's a good idea?
I just interviewed him, do not tell me I have to do it too. The puppeteer gets tired.
I just do not know! It simply does not seem right.
Why?! You two are so destined to be together, everyone thinks so.
Really?! Ross too?
Above all Ross!
Oh uh, hey Phoebe. You know what? I'll come back later.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of full house here. I just imagine ... I'll be back.
Here it is, your girlfriend.
I think so.
Even if he plays with himself in his sleep.
I can not say I'm surprised.

Oh, it's so unlucky.
What?
Cute naked boy is really starting to get fat.
Ok, I'll be back in a minute. Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You did not leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Oh, then it must have been you. Hello.
Bye Bye! That's why I went out.
Hey, you know when we're here, when you tell my sister you do not live here anymore.
I think he already knows at some levels.
Night Mon Night Julio.
Adios.
Look at Julio, someone left their book here.
Ah, actually, this is mine.
Oh yes, what are you reading?
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Did you read it?
I read it? No, are you enjoying yourself?
I thought so, but the translation is not good.
You are a poet and you do not know it.
Actually I ah, I'm a poet.
Oh, you know that. So, what kind of things do you write?
Things that move me, the shadow of a tree, a laughing child, or this lip.
Mine? Right here?
I can write an epic poem on this lip.
How was it going? Well, he did not rhyme, but I liked it.

Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
What?
We are at my stop. But would you like to have a coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?
Yes. So, coffee?
The coffee looks fantastic. Wait, so, do you live in Montreal?
Oh, no. But it's only a two-hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

Ok, here's the batch 22.
Oh, maybe these will look a little like those of your grandmother.
This has some orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Let's try.
All right. Friend, I have
Oh, for what? How a sale of baked goods?
No, just a Friday night.
Would you do it?
Would you do it? You ate my candy bar!

Oh my God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know, honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I want to quit, but then I think I should stick to it, so I think why such a person should stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's distantly related to the field they're interested in.
Damn, I do not know Rach. To sort !! I took a Yentel soup, a James Beans and a Howdy in possession of the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I did not ...
I do not mind paying my debts, you know, it's just how much I'll learn about fashion by walking towards Mira, the arthritic seamstress, in the bathroom.
Hello! Is my misery fun for you?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah ....
It's not fun, this is actually my job.
Oh believe me, I_I_I was there. I had to order dummy heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, so I'll be back to talk to my friend here.
And you can go back to enjoy your little hamburger.
Ah, just another thing.
Yup?!
I, I work at
Do you want my pickle?

Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Why?
I just want to check my horoscope, see if it was right.
My God.
Phoebe.
Do not look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and throw us into a depression pit.
Where is it? Ooh, come to mom.
He's coming. Be calm, be calm, be calm.
We should do something. Whistle.
We're not going to whistle.
Come on, do it.
No!
Just do it!
No!
Do it foul!
Woo-woo!
I can not believe you did it!

Hello! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm Alessandro's chef.
Yet?
I think the things you said about me are really unjust, and I would like you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
I see no reason why I would like to do it again to myself.
Eat it, or come in.
Spoon? So, what do you think?
I am torn between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I have to be honest, your soap is abysmal.
Thata girl! Eh? We should get out of here; there is a new class coming soon.
Welcome to the introduction to the kitchen. Now, before you start, can someone tell me the difference between a Dutch sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
I can.
Ok, proceed.
Well, they both have an egg yolk and a base of butter, but a beetroot has scallion, shirvel and, above all, tarragon.
It's very good, what's your name?
Monica.
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
All right.

And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seen.
But they tell me that for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen.
Humaaan spleeeeen.
Ole!
What are you doing here!
Well, you said you had customers lined up on the street, so I'm here to entertain!
Great!
Yes!
It was really great, you know, some of these people saw me play before because they were asking for a lot of my songs!
Yes, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
Listen to Phoebe ...
Yes.
You know how much I like listening to your music, you know, but ...
But what?
This is a kind of class seat.
Ok, do not say anything else.

I'm so bored! Rain stupid, we ... we can not do anything.
Well, I brought books. We could read
Hey, it has not arrived yet.
Hey Hey Hey! It does not matter if I do it!
I'm sorry, sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
Hey, Rach, do you want to go to a convention?
We can not. We are not pharmacists!
I know we are not, but Frank Medeio and ... Eva Trorro ... womba ...
Kate Miller?
Kate Miller is.
And ... this is the most sex part I'll have this weekend.
If so, should I make sure it's really good?
Thank you.

My God!
We've heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
This year must have been fantastic!
But it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that do not even fit!
No. No, you're not a loser.
Watch me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben designed your picture! Eh? You're ... you're a cowboy!
Oh, because of the leather pants.
To see? Ben does not think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now it's something.
Yes!
This is really something; It's really fantastic
Good companion!
Maybe I should have another pair!
Ooh, you know, they ... they had a little fringe on all sides.
I'm going to kiss Ben, goodnight.
I can not believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would be a good cowboy.
Ok, now that it's all over here, I think I'm, I'm going to do the laundry.
Oh yes, me too. You know if this shirt is dirty. Yup.
No you did not. You said you would do it, but you never did it!
Oh yeah!

Great nap.
It was really.
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends that I am.
So we talk about women. I'm sure our women readers will be interested in learning about your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, as I do, I look at a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how's it going?"
Oh please!
Hey how's it going'?

Hey, Mikey
Hey P
What are you doing?
Setting the mouse traps.
To kill Bob ??
No, no, to test his neck strength.
No, Mike, I do not want to kill him!
I thought we would capture him and, as you know, free him in the countryside where he could meet a friendly friend and a hostile owl.
Ok, ok, throw away the traps.
I'll find Bob, I'll take it.
Bob?
Bob!
Roberto!
Oh wait, I think I heard it.
Oh - Oh my god!
Bob had children!
Bob is a mother!
Better to think of a new name for him.
I do not know, I like Bob for a girl.
I do not know, I mean, I'm not sure ...
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Maybe it was not Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Suzie?

Hmmm, soup!
Joey, Ross will be here any minute now, would you mind looking at Ben for me while I was using the women's room?
Oh yes, no problem
Thank you.
Hi Ben! So you want to be an actor eh? I have to tell you, it's not a picnic. There are tons of waste.
Joey!
Which? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yes, but he waited until the last minute!
So if I said yes, he would have known I had nothing better to do than wait for an invitation to his stupid party.
I said no!"
Which puts
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ball? There is no ball.

Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Yes, you know, eh, let's jump.
What?! Why?!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
Oh great! what
Well, ok, look. I do not know, listen, I do not know what's going on here, but let's do it
Do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close to them?
No-no, they are not very kind people.
Ok, listen, I really like you.
All right?
I think this can go somewhere.
So, if I were close to my family, will you let it stop us?
Well, I ... I do not know. See when ... when you put it that way, you can do it
Danny! Hurry up! The bathroom is getting cold!
What?
Yes, ok, see you later.

It's over.
Oh, was it terrible?
Well, it was a ring.
I had not even realized how late it was, until I noticed the shadow of the 5 on his head.
In any case, he did not want to stay.
I called a taxi; she left.
I wrote you a letter
Ohh! Thank you! I like the post.
These are just a few things I was thinking about.
Some things about us, and before we can think of the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
All right. Wow, it's ... it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better break up with this baby.
Well, I'll wait for you, come on when you're done.
All right, I'll be up, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
The waiter brought the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said that we except the
All right, I retract.
But I stay from my review, I know the food and it's not that.
Your marinara sauce is as tasty as tomato juice!
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
My God! Do you own an Italian restaurant and do you think it tastes good? Where are you from?
Lebanon.
Give me those tomatoes, I'll show you how it should be! Come on, give me to me.
How long will that take? Because I received another critic to scream.

Ok, so what happened?
Ohh. Uh Huh. Uh Huh. You will have your turn!
Hey Phoebe, what's going on?
Anything! This is not over!
No! No! No!
What?!
I was up all night writing this really ugly letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-In reality, thank you!
All right! All ready to go to the cinema?
In fact, I think I'll skip it.
Really?
Yes, I will stay and read my book. I just want to be alone now.
Oh. Are you sure you do not want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, receive mail and stuff.
All right, Joe.
All right, let's go to Phoebe.
Oh God!

It was great.
I know.
Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have just started a family.
Nine months from now we can be here, have our baby.
And if not, we have to do it on a bucket.

Ross! You must stop! All right?! You can not just look through the hole for three hours! You will get a nice eye!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I always knew she liked it!
You know, she would say no, but here we are!
Right?
We just broke up, first thing he does!
You have not just broken up.
Hey, it's been three weeks!
You slept with someone three hours after you thought you had broken up. I mean that the bullets have left their weapons for longer!
That's Bill Clinton.
Who is huggin '?
My God! That's Pete! But why Bill Huggin 'Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
We use it !!
Here it is !!
Oh my God, Monica will come out with a millionaire.
I will not go out with him.
Oh my God, I can not believe this is a real $ 20,000 check, oh this is so exciting.
Or incredibly offensive.
Oh yes, of course, that too.
What?

Hey, so, do you know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yeah!
Well, you know how I'm trying to fix things with Emily.
Well, there's this thing, okay, here it is.
I made a promise that - Oh hey!
What?
Your nose is bleeding!
Oh God.
No!
Oh, not again!
This-this happened when my grandfather died.
It's ugh!
Sorry.
Oh, ok, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Umm
Sorry. Sorry.
Ok, I can not see you anymore.
Yes I know. It's ridiculous! I can not see you either.

Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hi, Chip.
Hey, Rach! How are you'?
I am big! I am big. I have a great job at
So, is Monica still ready?
He will stay out in a second. So, Chip, how are you, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Wow! I have not seen her since ... So, is Monica ready?

That's right, I love you! And ... and I will play with you all the time.
How can you let him talk to your horse like that?
He is talking to the child.
Ohh!
All right!
Okay, because when-when he said "I can not wait to hear your first words", I thought, "There's a trick."
All right. Well, I have to go guys. See you later.
All right.
Oh my, oh my God!
Aw, it's amazing!
Wow!
She is kicking so much!
Oh, she's like umm oh who is that kind of annoying soccer player?
Mia Hamm?
Mia Hamm!
Oh, it's fantastic
Oh, oh !! A hand on the sheet Joe!
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!

Ok, what do you guys think?
Guy!
I've never known a love like this.
Do you really like it?
Guy! How did you write this?
I stole Monica and I changed her name.
You can not
If it goes first, it can!

Hey!
Yes!
In any case, I - I still think we should try to fix things, you know?
For example, maybe we could take him to get tickets for another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow, it's a great idea! IS
Here it is.
Oh.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I took this.
Here it is.
You know, I have to tell you, sometimes just ... I do not understand Chandler.
You know, he and I do stuff all the time without you and do not get angry.
All time?
All time!

Cassie, how are you ... how are you doing with that hot dog.
I finished.
Thanks God.
I guess the last time we really enjoyed it was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh right.
Right.
Ooh, remember when I ... I nailed you and tickled until you cried?
We're probably too old to do it now.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all these freckles.
Uh Huh! Uh Huh! E-e-and I'll always remember that summer because it's when I realized we're related.
It took you so long to understand it, eh?
Well, I am, I'm a bit slow. Just like our children would be.

Relax any muscle in your body.
Listen to the plutky-plunky music.
Ok, now close your eyes and think of a happy place.
Ok, tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
All right. No, no, no, not a thing about Richard, put the glass down. And leave!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, ok, well, use my happy place.
Ok, I will, I have to ask you not to move anything.
All right, I'll try not to do it.
Ok, okay, so, yours in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky ....
Do you think breaking up with him was a big mistake?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Ok, just, the warm breeze and the moonlight flowing through the trees ....
I bet it's totally over me, I bet it's fine.
All right, bet and bet of any kind, I'm sure, I'm not allowed in the happy place.
All right.
Just, you know, the beautiful waterfalls and the dripping fountains.
And the ... the calming sounds of the stream ...
Ok, this does not work. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.

OK honey, see you later.
See you later.
Bye bye Julie.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, come on, cut it off.
Hey?
What?
Can I ask you something?
Hey, Rach, do you want to hear the new song I'm thinking of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Ok.
Uh, Rachel, honey, could I see you for a minute?
What happens?
F.Y.I ..
I decided to pay a professional musician to play here on Sunday afternoons.
His name is Stephanie ... something.
It should be very good.
What do you think of Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not like your friend is bad, it's so bad, it makes me want to put my finger in my brain and turn it around.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you can not do this.
Uh ...
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. Do I have to do this to you?

Ahh, no.
Oh.
You're jealous?
No, I know I do not see why she has to play with you, that's all.
I mean, do not you have any friends mothers strippers?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous.
All right, umm, people hear certain things about the strippers.
And you know, and um, I ...
Honey, I love you too
Ugh. Wait wait wait.
What?
Huh.
Well, there's a kiss he will not forget for a couple of hours, you know.
Yes. Or that, or you just turned it on and sent it to a stripper.

I can not believe you're back.
Do not say anything
I do not want to talk, I do not want to think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love with me right here, right now.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
You lost the exit!
Oh sorry.
My God, what were you thinking?
Um, Barry.
Awwww !!

I ... I thought you were doing it, I did not know you were in love!
Guy!
And hat to Phoebe. Rather a competitor. And I could say that your breasts are still showing.
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Well, actually, Ross does not.
Yes, and we would appreciate it if no one had told him.

Dear Mary-Angela.
Hello.
How are you.
This is the most difficult letter I have ever written.
What the hell is a problem with you?
How do you think Joey will react when he finds out that you blew your sister with a letter?
Well, this is the part where you tell him I moved to France. When in reality I will be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, you have to do it alone, okay in person.
At least you know his name.
Go home and ask Mary-Angela, okay, when she comes to the door, take her for a walk, let her fall easily.
What if Mary-Angela went to the door and I asked about Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?

Hey.
You may be right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Umm, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
All right.
Ok, here it is. I have two queens, what's wrong?
A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you won! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Oh yeah! Ok, let's play again. What do you have?
A four and a nine.
You're joking, right?
No because?
Well, this is a full cup!
Damn! I'm good at Coppe!

What? Why? Where are you?
I'm still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! I'm sorry! The boy is drunk, they will not let me go until we understand.
My God! I have to find another minister.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look, look, you put them both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Do not hang up on me! I will marry you and you now! I've got the power!

Oh hey Joey! What happens?
I can not decide which route to take in Las Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot, have you?
Yes, I've been around.
Ok, so, which road should I take for the northern or southern road?
Ooh, if you take the northern road there is a man in Illinois with a beard.
Ok, I have to protest, I've lived in Illinois all my life and I do not know any bearded man!
Wisconsin, on the other hand, could be a different story.
Great! Problem solved!
Estelle, you have to get me a job. I lost my health insurance.
All right, first thing we have to do, damage control.
Why?
Well, I think someone out there could have gotten you bad in the whole city.
Bastard!

You mean every time Monica and Chandler are like when you do the laundry or go shopping or ... oh!
All that time Monica went to the phone with the sad Linda of the camp!
Uh-huh, do it. Doing it. Telephone that does it.
Oh!
Oh, I can not believe it!
I mean, I think it's great!
For him.
It may be able to do better.
Hey guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
Phoebe just heard about Monica and Chandler.
Do you mean how they are friends and nothing more?
No. Joey, her
Ok, now they know you know it and they do not know that Rachel knows that?
Yes, but you know what?
It does not matter who knows what.
Now, enough of us know that we can simply tell them that we know it!
Then all the lies and secrets would finally be over!
It is a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided he was gay, he left and left all his family.

You know, you're a friend who gets married, he has to change things.
Do you really think it would be different?
How could it not be?
I want to say that soon we will have children, and then they will go out with other couples who have children.
And then maybe they will have to leave the city to be close to
Well, things change.
I do not want them to move to
Everything will be fine, Joe.
It's still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
It could be out of town. Maybe he will leave for months.
At that point, the cheesecake may have gone wrong. We do not want you to go back to a bad cheesecake.
No, that could kill her.
Well, we do not want it.
No, so we're protecting it.
But we should take it.
But we should move fast.
Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving in there.
Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!

Hey, Kicky. What are you doing?
I'm just trying to get comfortable. I can not sleep in my underwear.
Well, you will do it.
I was thinking. You know, about how I always see girls on girls ...
Are they running out, or tall as pancakes?
You know what I mean, about how I always go out with all these women.
And I always thought, when the right one comes, I would be able to be a boy standing and go far, you know?
Now I'm looking at my father, thinking ...
Hey, you're not him.
It is you.
When they took you to go to your father's pipe business, did you get away?
No.
No.
You have decided to enter the world of actors out of work.
It was not easy, but you did it!
And I would like to believe that when the right woman arrives, you will have the courage and the courage to say "No thanks, I'm married".
Do you really think that?
Yes. I really do it
Thanks, Chandler.
Get off!

Hello.
Your Fettuccine Alfredo seem a bit 'dry, you used all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean to eat as a pre-cooking snack?
And the cream?
The cheese makes me thirsty.
All right. Go on.
All right.
Oh! Something smells good at Monica station! My God! This is absolutely amazing! Have you never done it before?
Oh no!
I do not know anything about the kitchen.
I had to ask someone what's his name when, when the water makes those little bubbles.
Well, hat to the chef.
I-I-I'm sorry, you-your mouth was full, I did not hear what you said. Umm, hello to whom now?
The cook!
Quite right.

Hey, Phoebe.
Hey.
How are you?
Good. Oh, oh! Roger is having dinner and wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
Nothing, um, it's just, um ... It's Roger.
I do not know, there's just something on ...
Basically we feel that he is ...
We hate that guy.
Yes. I hate it.
Sorry, Phoebe, we're sorry.
Uh Huh.
All right.
Okay, do not you think, maybe, is it just that it's so perspicacious that it scares you?
... No, we hate it.
We are sorry.

Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
I'm postponing all these things that Chandler bought from guilt.
Yes, this was mine.
Because I thought you'd connect with a girl and she left him there.
Yes, it would have made more sense.
You know, I-I do not even know you're more man!
All right, look, I only ask you this time.
And whatever you say, I will believe you.
Were you or were you not on a gay cruise?
!

Oh hey! There are children playing in the street, do you want to go there and give them a project, ruining their day?
Hey, if they have a ball, maybe you can put razor blades and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
He said what?
He said: "If I'm not happy to get married somewhere we find in one day, well, then we should just postpone".
Bring back?
Emily, do you think Monica understands how much our parents spent on this wedding?
The brain of a young child of my sister understands that people have lost time from their lives to fly thousands of miles from here, eh?
This is not right.
I realize that people will be disappointed. But I'm sure they will come back when we can do it well.
Can not I ask people to do it? Would you ask people to do it?
Do not point your pants against me!
We have no choice!
Wherever it's decent, it would have been booked months ago, Ross, do not you understand?
This is our marriage that I'm talking about.
The only thing I understand is; postponing is not an option. This is when we will get married.
So what are you saying? Is it now or never?
No. I'm saying it's time.
OR?
There is no "o" in mind. What's wrong with these pants? !!
They are not pants.
You're the one behind you.
And if, and if you do not understand how important it is to me, well then, maybe we should not marry at all!
Do not wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please

Hi sweetie.
See you later.
What? I bought groceries, I was going to make you have dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Hi, I'm Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to let you know that there has been a cancellation and if you are still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
Oh please, he did not hear it! He did not hear it !!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
NOOOO !!!!!!!!

But! What are you doing here?
I came to give you this and this.
Oww! Great ring!
Yes, always. I want the child to know my voice.
Are you talking about me?
Yes, yes, always.
Really?
But um, we refer only to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.

Would you look at this landfill? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much bullshit?
In fact, I think this apartment cheats on the good name of shit
Check it. Can I have it?
What?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
Suddenly, Leon, the manager, calls me in his office.
It turns out that they fired the head chef of lunch, and guess who got the job.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Fortunately it's me.
And, they made me the head of the purchase, thank you very much.
Anyway, I just met Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
You know, a nice place.
Yes, a nice place.
Yes!
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?

So, what do you think?
I think it's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
So, how does it work, are you going to balance the dishes with the heads of these guys?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Let's play!
Look on Ross! Point! You are disgusting!

What is this?
Thank you. Get comfortable.
Gotcha.
This place is really my grandmother.
I got her from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I would never have been able to afford a place like this.
So, if the landlord asks, I am an 87-year-old woman who is afraid of her video recorder.
So are you thirsty?
Oh, you can bet on it!
Ok, here's your penis!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
How was your first day?
Oh ok.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Thanks, it's from my mother. So this is the kitchen.

Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Great! How about going to the Italian place on Bleaker Street, right?
Ooh, I love that place! Then no.
How about Mama Lisettie?
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long that milk has left.
Oh, no-no, this place is completely healthy!
That ... this milk is mine.
I bought it today because I was thirsty for milk, you know.
OK let's go!
Hello Friend! He knows Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all waste materials to come out
But then I should go around the laundry.
Oh, so you're saying that you'd choose convenience for health ?!
Ok, stop!
Larry, okay, can not you just be Larry and not Larry, the health inspector?
You know, well, at the beginning it was really exciting, but now it's like, okay, so where are we going to eat?
Well, I suppose I could give you a warning.
Thank you.
OK Go!
Leave!
Leave!
Now, if after dinner you still need to make someone fail, I know a hot dog seller who takes his nose.

No! No! Phoebe, let's go! I do not want to pass! Please come! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No, but from Monica you can eat cookies on the sink!
I know. I'm sorry.
All right! It looks so funny.
Yes.
God, what a mess.

Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost.
A young girl lent her uniform to her nineteen-year-old sister, who went to the United States.
Nimitz and has sold over 2000 boxes.
Hey! How was the interview?
Oh, I blew it. He would not even hire me.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you'll go on like a thousand interviews before you find a job.
That's not how he had to go out.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
You know what Rach, maybe you should just, you know you're here at the cafe.
I can not!
It's too late!
Terry has already hired that girl over there.
Look at her, she also had a waitress experience.
Last night he was teaching everyone how to make napkin .... swans.
That word was swans.

What did we get there?
A piece of something: boxers, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-carbonized portrait. Wow, that guy is more hairy than the Boss!
You know, it's a really funny story how it happened.
Everything is alright.
Everything is alright.
You do not have to explain.
This is not the first bonfire of the boyfriend we've seen get out of control.
You're our third call tonight.
Really?
Oh sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.

I'm so sorry, guys. I did not want to take you down.
No, you were right. I do not have a plan.
Thank you God. Food.
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I do not even have a "pl".
No, no, that's not what we ordered ... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Wait! Did you say "G.Stephanopoulos?"
Wait, was it a ... a Mediterranean boy with a curiously clever intelligent appearance?
Wore a beautiful blue suit?
Is it a tie of power?
Oh God.
You are crazy?! We have George Stephanopoulos pizza!
Uh, Phoebe? Who is George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
I see the pizza!
Oh, I want to see! Let me see! Let me see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?

Hey, do you know what a good rainy day is?
What?!
I mean nude game. Strip poker, we should definitely play strip poker.
No, no!
What are you crazy ?!
Come on! When you go away, you have to play, it's like a law!
All done!
Thank you.
Ok, who's next ?!
No-o-o! There's no way!
C'mon, please?! I'm Boredddd! Let me do it once before.
Yes, well, if ah, if this is the rule this weekend ... No!

It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor ever. Whoa! Are you going in there?
What, like a number?
Hey!
Hello! Hello!
Ok, I'm finished with my choices, these are final.
Well, it's now.
Ooh, very official.
Oh yes, well, you know, Chandler printed it on his computer.
And who laminated it?
That would be me.
Okay, let me see Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer and Dorothy Hammel?
Hey, it's my list.
Okay honey, you realize that it just turns like this on ice.

Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings for Fonzie or any of the gods
Hello! And are you going in that class?
Umm, I'm actually a resident of the first year, but I understood a lot, see, I graduated early
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should have specified that I would need an adult doctor.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified for
Shh!
Doogie, shh!
Someone does not understand that soon I will have children?
Eh?
Leave!
Go small boy, go!
Oh nice! You made him cry!

Hey, there are some people out there, asking for candy.
Well, they'll just have to wait, right? I have only two hands !!
Need help?
No! You do not know the system! There will be no one to mess with the system!
Your license please.
You do not ... do not you want to hear about my dream agent?
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
Do you have a son!
I know. I know.

Uh, how could these margaritas?
Hi, Mr. Bing.
I liked your Stevie Wonder last night.
Thank you. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I need them on my desk
Sure.
No problem.
You have to give it something, you know.
Ok, now it was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with a mustache?
Petrie.
Petrie, right, right. Ok, some people will work

....right?
Right?
I mean, it's pretty incredible, I mean, they just took off, they left without even looking back.
You know, I do not, I do not need them, huh, now I have you guys as friends, you and Susan.
Ah, Susan will be so happy.
717? Where is 717? Hey, do you have more for Susan, right?
No. But fine, I'll put pickles or something.
Ross, thank God.
Phoebe? What, why are you whispering?
I ate a bug.
Hey, Rachel, the swabs here are just a penny. We stock up.
Listen Ross, we have finished the gas and we do not know where we are, so we can not take a tow truck.
Oh, now you want a favor?
Yes thanks.
Well, I'm sorry that your car broke Phoebe, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends now, but please call to let me know you've come home safe and sound?
Phoebe, wait a minute. Here, take my car, go get your friends.
No, I will not collect them.
Listen, we both know you'll do it because you're not an idiot.
All right?
So you can pout here for half an hour and then go get them, or spare us both times and pout in the car.
No, Rachel does not want me ...
Look, I_I_I'm sorry that Rachel dumped you because she's in love with that Mark, and you're the innocent victim in all this, but do not punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Yes you are right.

God, I feel so guilty for Ross.
Oh I know.
I feel like it's my fault.
Guy? If you kept this to yourself, none of this would have happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things for myself these days, something was meant to slip out!
Well, I think what you said is very courageous.
All right, I can not sit here anymore. I have to walk in places.
Phoebe, what are you doing with your coat? And the whole thing about animal rights?
Well, I read and for your information, minks are not very nice.
Ok, I admit it!
I love this coat!
Ok, I-it's the best thing I've ever had around me, including Phil Huntley!
Remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine!

So your father has passed. He is a pleasant man!
Oh no
It's better for me to go. (He goes and sits in the
Ross, I'm so sorry. It's okay. I-I promise I'll straighten him up tomorrow with him in person or by e-mail.
I do not care about your father! I'm interested in Mona! She was there and now she's totally out of her mind!
Oh ok, I'll fix it. What is your e-mail address?
Rachel!
All right, I promise. I'll fix it. I swear. I-I-I-I-I will talk to you.
All right!
All right.
Thank you!
That's all?!
Do you call it combat?
Come on!
"We were on a break!"
"No, we were not!"
What happened to you?
!

Hi, could we have two burritos to go, please?
I'm sorry.
But not so sorry, because you do not have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation under the name of Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets for the
I'm sorry. Christmas is a busy period, sir.
Is it because of the burrito thing?
You have to give him some money.
Give him some money? It was a joke!
No, to have a table! Places like this are always shaking you. Everyone wants to be repaid.
Well, calm down, O'Mally. I will give him some money.
You must be calm about it.
Hey, I can be calm.
Listen, we're in a hurry, so if you can get us a table a little faster, I'd appreciate it.
OK sir.
All right.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Ok, you're a hard worker! I will remember to put it in your evaluation.
Thing?
Well, you've been here for two months and your boss is asked to provide a performance evaluation.
But you know, there's one thing I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
No, I always wanted to do it. Can you help me clean this up?

I can dry it.
I can put the gel on it.
It does not matter, I end up with this little uncertain thing in the middle of my head.
It's so boring.
Does it bother you?
You disgust me.
Is there any chance you did not see it?

Hey, Joey, what are you doing?
Sweepin '. Why? Light yourself?
No.
Huh. What happens if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey, done
Where are you going? The vicar will not be home for hours.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Did you find my book?!
Yes i did it!
Joey, what ... what are you doing going to my bedroom ?!
Ok, look, I'm sorry, I went there to take a nap and I know I should not have, but you have porn!
Hey-hey, you know what?
I do not care!
I'm not ashamed of my book.
There's nothing wrong with a woman having fun with a bit of erotica.
It is only a healthy expression of female sexuality, which you will never understand.
You have porn!

Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want shortbreads? Eh is Scottish like you.
Oh no thanks. I do not like
What?!
Well, it's just that my whole family has been short of Scotland from the Vikings. However, many bad memories.
Oh well, it seems to me that your family is ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.
No!
No-no they are not.
I'm still very angry!
But you also know Chandler is half Swedish.
Do you know what the Swedes are famous for?
Sitting and making silence.
Well yes, yes, Scottish history is much more
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding !!
How did you know?

Hello!
Hello!
Come in.
Thanks for the return, umm, okay, there were a lot of people interested in the room, but I narrowed it down
Great!
Okay, before I make my final decision, I just want to make sure that our personalities match.
Ok, I invented a small test.
Now I will say a word and then you will say the first thing that comes to mind.
I can do it.
All right! Here we are. Pillow.
Combat.
Very good! All right. G.
String?
Excellent! Ok, um, little dog.
Kitten?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close, though, bye bye!

Dad, please do not pick your teeth here!
Well, and if you want to lift your feet, why do not you sit on the
Monica, leave it alone
Will you hurry?
Did not you hear me before when I told you that all Janine's friends are dancers ?!
And that they are going to drink a lot!
?
No, I did it, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well, you're doing so slowly! Can not you do it faster?
Joey!
Come on!
I do not want to make mistakes, okay?
This is the only sweet and if they ruin they'll all be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel ruined it?"
So why do not you just let me worry about being silly and just worry about eating it, okay?
Oh, I am!
Ross, if you do not tell him, then I'll do it!
OK well!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, can you wait a second for Joey? I have to say something to my parents. No he can not? All right.

You are so cute! How did you become so cute?
Well, my grandfather was Swedish and my grandma was actually a little bunny.
Ok, now you're even nicer !!
You know, today is a popular opinion, I must say.
What?
The strangest thing happened at the cafeteria, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting me.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you that I think Phoebe thinks I'm crazy.
It is not possible!
Ouch!
I'm sorry it's lonely, Phoebe always thought I was, you were charming in a sexless way.
Oh, you know ... I can not hear it enough.
I'm sorry, I think you just misunderstood it.
No, I did not misunderstand it, okay? She was on me! He touched my bicep to scream loudly!
This biceps?
Well, it's not inflated right now!

It's Phoebe.
Umm, well, I have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, good, umm Grandma is dead.
No, she just died today! Ok, we're doing a funeral service tomorrow.
No you did not!
Well, many people! Listen, do you come to the funeral service or not?
Beautiful. Ok, enjoy your concert.

anyway, it's called Allan and we've been out for three years.
He was my first client when I became a party organizer.
He was organizing a party for his girlfriend at the time.
Oh good.
And he was Theta Beta Pi in Syracuse.
Oh. Oh that's great!
Oh, you're one of
Really? Do you like it?
Well, you know, we would like to repeat everything the other said, or, uh, we would jump out of the closets to frighten each other, or exchange salt sugar to put salt on their cereal.
That's a good one.
Yes? You like that?
Yes, you're funny.
I'm funny?
Oh thank God!
Well, hey, I have a ton!
Umm, oh here ... Do you want a good one?
Here is a good one
Umm, you take a quarter, take a quarter, and you're curious about it.
Right?
And then you say in person, I bet you can not roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without you leaving your face.
And then when they do, they stay with a large line of black pencil right in the middle of their face.
Can I do it for you?
Yeah, me-I-I'm fun Ben, but I'm not stupid. All right?

Chloe? Hello..
Is it on me that you're taking your watch?
Did you get my watch?
I'm sorry, I do.
I keep it, listen, did you tell any of us?
Oh no, I feel it's nobody's business, you know.
Oh, another thing. Hoshi thinks that being in the front row may have influenced my concentration.
Yes. That - that was the problem.

Excuse me, Doug? Hey, passionate about sports !!
Bing! Do you have those numbers for me?
So are you still in touch with someone from high school?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, um, I think it's like that. How are you?
Oh yes, I'm still with Simmons and Zana, you know.
I see a lot of Spindler.
Devane, Kelly and I come across Goldie from time to time.
Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
That's all?
Ehh, you know after high school, you lost a little bit of tact. Oh yeah! I met Richard Dorfman.
Ohh, how are you?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Is not he an architect now?
Yes, they still wear underwear.

So the guy Porsche took his car back.
But did you find the keys to your clothes?
No. No, I'm just uh, I loved the way it feels when everyone thinks they own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you wear clothes?
Really?!
Oh yeah! Yes, so you came across Richard! You grabbed a bite! It is nothing serious.
Great!
Ok, London 1

Hey, Monday, I was just doing the dishes!
Hey!
Oh! It is you. Hello.
What about me?! You - you just said I could!
I'm not even marrying! Ok, this is a question for science fiction writers!
I can not believe you're not kidding me.
Hey, how can you?
Neither am I not even either
Well, you know what, it's all. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my witness.
Yup! Too bad for you man.

Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading the man is here! We go to work.
Umm, slight change of program. We have closed.
C-What?! Why?!
It's a question of money, we do not have any.
You're joking, right?
No.
What?!
It is probably only temporary. We hope to get some money soon, so if you could ... uh, go out.
Uh, go out ?! How long?
I do not know.
A week?
Maybe two?
The money will come!
People will always want to invest in movies!
Hey, you're not rich, are you?
No!
Eh, it's worth shooting. Look at Joey, let me know where you are, okay?
Hey buddy, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yes.
These went away for you.
Thank you. Congratulations on your big chance.

Rachel, did you leave some muffins?
Yes, I forgot which ones.
Oh, you're busy, all right, I understand that. Does anyone else want one?
Hey.
Hey!
So, how was Joan?
I broke up with her.
Do not tell me, because of the great thing about the nostrils?
They were huge. When he sneezed, the bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not so huge.
I'm telling you, leaned back; I could see his brain.
How many perfectly perfect women will you reject the most superficial and insignificant things?
Keep it, keep it.
I must align myself with Chandler on this.
When I moved into town for the first time, I went out a couple of times with this really lovely girl, a big kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
It drove me crazy.
You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women do not have Adam's apples.
Guys, you're joking with me, are not you?
Yes.
It was nice. For a second, I was like "whoa".

Oh my God, he lost it. He totally lost it.
What?
OR! Or we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them at the source.
You are a genius!
Aww, man, now we will not be bank mates!
Now, there are two reasons.
Hey.
Hey!
Ohh, guys, remember that nice customer I told you about? I bit him.
Where is it?!
On touchy.
IS
I do not know!
I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch it, I just want to throw away my old oath and get a new, dirty one.
Well, the next time you massage him, you should try to distract yourself.
Yes! Yes! Yes! I like it when I'm doing something exciting and I do not want to
Thanks, Joey.
No no thanks.

Hey, Estelle, listen
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back eh? They
What are you talking about? I've never left you! You've always been my agent!
Really?!
Yes!
Oh well, not bad, nothing wrong.
Okay, you guys are free tonight?
Yes!!
Tonight? You, you did not say it would be at night.

Yup? Yup?! How can I help you?
Yes, we were just looking around.
Oh-oh, you're a fellow scholar.
What were you looking for exactly, hmm?
Perhaps, perhaps the reflections of Dr. Chester Stock on Smiledon's Californicus?
Uhh.
Ah Ah get out of here! Uh, meet someone? Or ... or are you here just to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Uh, I actually find Marion's views too overly progressive.
I find the views of Marion too overly progressive.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm a professor here, Ross Geller.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-wait! Did you write this?
Yup! Are you the person who checked my book ?!
You know, you do not look anything like what I thought. You're so young.
Well, I skipped the vote.

You did not have the right to tell me that you ever had feelings for me.
What?
I was doing great with Julie before I discovered you.
Hey, I was doing great before you discovered yourself. Do you think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
The point is that I ...
I do not need this now, OK.
It's too late, I'm with someone else, I'm happy.
This ship has sailed.
All right, fine, go ahead and do it, all right Ross.
Beautiful.
Because I do not need your stupid ship.
Good.
Good.

Oh, it's so romantic to send honeymooners.
You know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
All in due time my love.
All in good time.
Oh, shoot!
I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later.
I do not have a key, they took mine to give you.
What?! They took mine to give you!
Why should they take off our keys?
Wow! It seems like we have a lot of good things.
Oh, we did it, but my mother gave us the greatest gift of all.
A
No. He will come with us for eight weeks.
Uh, what?
Yup! It will help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
What ... you're not serious.
I mean she's a very nice woman, but there's no way to take eight weeks.
It will drive us crazy.
Hi Ross!
Hi roomie!

Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I do not know!
It's not like it's porn!
This is a serious and legitimate film.
You know?
And nudity is really important for the story.
This is what you say about porn.
You are right. Maybe I should not even go to the call.
No! No you should! Many main actors make nude scenes! I mean, the possibility of acting in a movie? Come on!
Well, it's true
And I'm naked in one scene only.
It also seems really fantastic.
My character is Catholic and falls in love with this Jewish girl.
Those who escape together and are captured in this great storm.
So we go to this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
It is really sweet and tender.

Hi how are you?
Nothing, Monica and I argued stupidly.
But you're still moving together, right? Because my announcement came out today.
"Wanted, female roommate, non-smoker, not ugly." Beautiful!
Yes?
I just imagined that, after living with you, it would be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, you know?
Someone from whom I can learn, someone, someone different from me.
And what's more different than me? a boy who is

So where are we going next?
This witness will not return my calls, so we'll see if we can surprise him back home.
Sur-surprise? We're not, we're not going to make anyone angry, are we?
Come on man! Listen, uh, are you going to squeeze the perps shoes a bit before lawyers?
He is a witness, not a killer. And nobody talks like that!
Yes, nobody talks like that!
Oh what? Like your mister policeman!
Hey, I'm more a policeman than you two!
How do you understand it?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
I think so.
Here it is. Thank you!
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Oh what, you, do you want them both?
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring ?!
Ok, ok, ok, look, do not be scared, but I lost it.
I know it's in the apartment, but me
Well, what will I say to Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her earrings.
These
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings ?! I'm not allowed to borrow his things!
Why not?
Because I lose his things!

Well, you're sweating.
These are these beads of joy.
Oh, it's sweet. Do not touch me
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Yes!
What is going on?
Chandler's gone again!
My God! Why should you play hide and seek with someone you know is a risk of escape?

All right. Are you ready to push again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Ok, ok, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Yes!!
Little Leslie is here!
We have another one!
Oh my God, I can not believe I have two or two children.
How scary is it?
Come little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come little Chandler! Come on!
All right, it's coming. He's coming!
Hey, where's your thing?
Chandler is a girl!
Oh God, the flashback of the kindergarten.
They have to read the wrong ultrasound.
Because they thought they were a boy, but Chandler is a girl!
Chandler is a girl!
Ok, keep saying!
I'm late ?!
No-no ah, everything's fine. All are healthy, there are 30 fingers and 30 toes.
Do we have our children?
Yes.
Oh, we have our children.

Hey, Toby!
Hey Bobby.
In reality it is Bob. Hey, you work here, you can tell me where Chandler is
Uhh yes Yes, it's true, right there. Right there, yes. Can I ask you why?
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Ok, listen to Bob, I'm the reason you did not get the job here.
Toby no.
Bob!
Toby! I will not let you cover it for him. Whatever you say now will make me madder even more with Chandler!
Ohh!
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! He's so cute!
I know! I found it on the street.
Are you serious, really ?! It is in good condition.
Yes.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
I do not know.
It's moving.
Ew.
It's still - It has a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here !!
Ooh! Ah! All right!

Well, I went to Kyle the other night to collect some things and we got to remember
we talked for most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry with each other was because there were still feelings there. So
Oh, just say Kyle!
We'll do another try.
What about his lament and his constant need for attention ?!
I will work on it.
Oh, right, because you're so capable of changing.
You know, he hums when he pisses!
I know it.
It makes him lose the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
It's all right, we ... we do not need you. In fact, hey, I'm already thinking about it.
Yes, and you know what? I do not give a fuck.
Yes, we will go.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Phoebe, you were, you were right about her. You know, her
Oh. You know, he hums while he does other things.
Yes, we're better without them.
And you know, even if they broke up again, you'd better not leave it in your sad men's club!
Club for divorced men.
Potato, Potaato.

Why did not you come back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you have the keys?
Porsche.
This is totally your fault!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you ripped the paper from the court reporter's car !!
We can, we can only forget that it has never happened?
Yes sure, absolutely! You are right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Yup.
Well, I guess I'm, I'm going to pack.
All right. Oh wait! One more thing, do-do we still need to solve the question of "us?"

Phoebe!
Yes?
Did you see Chandler ?!
No! Why?
The woman in the museum called and said there was a cancellation and we could go to our wedding and Chandler heard!
I know!
How serious is this?
!
Well, for the normal boy, it's ugly, but Chandler, oh my God!
I know! I know! And he is completely out of his mind and I can not find him anywhere!
What will you do?
Well, I'll never listen to you again, that's for sure!
"You know, can you hurt if you go and put down your name?"
Rachel said this!
Well, Rachel is not here!

Come on come on.
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.
This should be, like, the most beautiful day of my life, you know?
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of being locked in a closet with you.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I waited for this as much as you.
No no no, believe me.
Nobody has waited as long as I have, ok?
And you know what's funny?
When this day is over, you can go home with the baby, ok?
Where do you leave me?
You must become the father of the child.
Everyone knows who you are.
Who I am?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's not ... the day of lesbian amateurs.
Every day is the day of lesbian loves.
Is fantastic
Do you want to explain it?
I mean, well, because when I was growing up, you know my father is gone, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole.
And here is this little child who has like three whole parents who worry so much that they are fighting over who will love him more.
And he's not even born yet.
He's alone, he's just the luckiest child in the world.
I'm sorry, you were fighting.

Ok, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just coming out.
Hi, how are you Kelly?
I'm doing well! God, Tiffany, you smell so beautiful!
It's my new perfume. Why do not you approach where you can
Oh, you know, Joey, you're sick!
This is disgusting!
I'm not reading this!
What?! Wait wait wait! The handsome man was about to enter !!

All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
I mean he has a monocle, he has a hat ...
Do you know he's gay?
I just want to clarify this: are you dating Mr. Peanut?
Danielle! Hello! Everyone, it's Danielle, Danielle, everyone.
Hello. Hello.
What are you doing here?
So what?
What?
What is that?
What did he leave you?
What do women like?
What did you leave for another woman who likes women?
Slightly stronger, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma who has not really heard you ...
So what?
My first time with Carol was ...
What?
It was Min e
With Carol? Oh.
So in all your life, you've been alone with one - oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a lot of stuff we could have done tonight!

Hello. Where is everybody?
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to block me: what's wrong?
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, it's a bit 'expired.
Oh no! Why?
Because Carol is a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
My God! I do not believe it! Oh, poor bunny.
I'm an idiot.
I mean, I should have seen it, I mean Carol and I would be outside and she would see a beautiful woman, and, and she would be Ross, look at her, and I would think, God, my wife is strong!
Aw! Hey, do you think Susan's person is her lover?
Well, now I do it !!
I'm sorry.
Seven years.
I mean, we've been together for seven years, she's the only woman I've ever loved and the only woman I've ever ...
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
I will do it.
No you will not.
Look, he knows he did something terrible and I believe him, he's sorry.
But you still have an excuse to do, all right, you have to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Ok, absolutely!
All right.
You got it
Cookie, now you can punch him!
What?!

All right, that's it, I stopped.
What? I did not say anything.
Yes, but this is not the face of a person who trusts a person.
Okay, this is the face of a person who, you know, does not trust a person.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Do you relax? I know what I'm doing. That's how he wears it.
Julie.
What?!
Jody!
Were you with Julie?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were ... doing shopping.
Oh. My God.
Honey, wait. We did it only once. It meant nothing to me.
Yeah, for sure. Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you all the time.
Look, I'm sorry, it's okay.
I never wanted you to find out!
Oh, please, you wanted to be discovered.
That's not true!
Oh, so you just happened to leave it here?
Did it ever occur to you that I could be just so stupid?
Ok, Monica. I just have to know something. You went with her to

Hey!
Yes!
I can not say
Why?!
Why not?
I can not say why it is famous.
Oh my God, who is it ?!
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Ok ok. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my child.
Like Barbara Streisand's husband, James Brolin?
What?! Well, he never told me!

In
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler is worse.
Friend, it must be so nice to remember things like that! I have no memories of past lives.
Of course you do not love him. You're brand new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, we do not tell this story.
Oh come on!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey framed Monica's turkey in the head!
What?! Does Joey have a turkey stuck on his head?
Hey, it's not like it seems.
His

Wendy, we had an agreement! Yes, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was that?
Wendy has been saved. I have no maids.
Oh ... it's too bad. Bye Bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I made plans to go around.
You know, Rachel, when you finished your marriage, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you ... twenty dollars an hour.
Done.

The reactor will burst in three seconds, we'll never make it!
You have to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I will not leave you!
Do not worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a car !!
No you are not! Not to me!
My God.
What?
I'm
Yes, you are fantastic! Ok, let's take it from
No, I mean I was really acting out my ass.
Yes, I thought I was also pretty good.
Oh yes, you're solid. Yes, you're not really me.
You know what? I think it's enough for now. Yes. I do not want to be tried above.
Well!
I will do it without you!
I do not need you or anyone else!
I will do it alone!
You will see!!
you

I can not believe Ross left. It's so sad.
I did not know Ross and you were so close.
We were not, but we had a lesson together. He was an exceptional boy and spoke passionately about science. I always remembered it.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear against it and listening carefully.
I've thought so many times to call him and ask him out. I guess I really lost my chance.
But you did not do it!
I am still alive!!
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.
It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day!
I mean, the fact that you're here means more to me than if this room was full of people!
You're a sick monster, who does it? I can not believe I have a crush on you!
Did you hear it? Kori Weston had a crush on me !!

We will do a quick check.
All right.
So, eight days late eh?
Yes.
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Eh, just a little bit.
You're 80 percent canceled, so you're on your way.
It could still last a bit longer.
If you are anxious, there are some ways to help things together.
Fouls !!
In reality, these are things you can do. Only some home remedies, but in my experience I have found that some of them are quite effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Ok, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
All right.
What's wrong with Emma?
Oh she misunderstood, she thought he was moving to Tulsa.

Whenever you're ready.
Ok, ok, here we are.
Ok, where am I talking, here?
I mean, uh, well, there's a way that seems to offer some acoustic advantage, but ...
Just aim for the collision.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here it is.
You know, I, you know, I can not do it.
Uh, this is too weird
I feel stupid.
So do not do it, all right. You do not have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hi baby. Bye Bye.

Hello!
Oh hello. It's Mark.
Oh.
What? Is it my breath?
Ouch!
Rachel?
Ouch! Ouch!
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. All right?
All right, I know.
All right.
I really do it
Ok, I'll take your coat and then I'll put you in a taxi.
All right. Oh wait, wait ... wait, will not you come with me?
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
All right.
All right?
Thank you. Oww !!!! God!
What?! I know, what's wrong?
I'm sorry, I can not go to the hospital with this aspect.

Pete Becker is going around the ring now. It seems, it's just trying to hear it. Oh, Bruiser is just ...
To run! Drive crazy, rich fanatic!
Oh, I can not watch this.
Take a look, it's winning! Pete is winning!
Really?!
No-o-o !!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going to his favorite area.
Oh! Oh!
Wait, if this is your favorite area, why is it so bad with this?
Well, this is ironic.
Of your last two boyfriends, Richard did not want to have children, and from his appearance, now Pete can not.
Friend, you do not have to brag! We have nothing here !!

Should we tell Rachel that there's an empty private room right next to her?
We could, or we can have sex in it.
Well let me think about this while I take off my pants!
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you were going out with him.
Oh! Oh, I think I'll throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.
What?!
What? I've just imagined that since you're pregnant you will not see people.
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Secondly, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I did not tell him. I did not know if you were telling people. This came back when I thought Kash was still people.
Well, well, do not tell him. Do not tell him. Just let me call ok?
Look at Rachel, I really do not think it's so great
Ok, go and do it! I'll be back on that set! I will meet more actors! I will meet them all!

Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
All right.
She is still there to enjoy her fake party and, ah, it's too late to do the things I had planned, so
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, wait, wait, wait
Tell him to wait!
All right. Wait! Wait!
Emily.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!

Hey. Call me when you arrive. All right?
All right.
I know. You're the type that would not want to make the chip for the handyman.
It does not matter!
No, I_I thought the way everyone was reacting was unfair. I mean you just moved.
I
Jen.
Jen, I know this might sound like a bit. But uh, you'd probably take a cup of coffee sometimes, or
Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?
Oh! My number is there. Call me.
I'll give you a call.
See you later.
All right!
I forgot my card.

Here we are. Ok, get ready.
What?
All right.
Ouch!
Are not you going?
No thanks.
No, Rachel never pisses in public toilets.
Well, they never wrote anything there, you know. So my rule is "no fabric, no crushing". Well, if everyone is going.
No, you know what does not close it because the ... keys ... are in there.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no !!
What is going on?
My lighter is in there!
I promise.
Even if you do not seem to be unable to visit.
Hey, is it, is Chandler here?
No, no it is not.
Guys, Joey just saw Janice kiss her ex-husband.
What? So, what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I was thinking about this and me, I think the best way would be, do not do it.
Joey, you can not keep it for yourself, if you know, you have to tell him.
He will kill him. I mean, he will kill him.
Well, you could wait as long as I go to the dentist, maybe

Hello!
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, oh, just, I was wondering, when you and I broke up, you got the tape that was half of the last episode of
Ah, yes, but now it's me and Susan in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Where is Ben?
He's sleeping.
Ahh. Ooh, it's a ah, is it a bad time?
Umm, yes, actually, Susan will be home any minute, it's a bit of an anniversary.
Oh! I thought you were married, January?
It's not that kind of anniversary.
Ah! Oh.
It was so !! Anyway...
Where will we find a small hat?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll have "The Rain Bear" !!
Why will you know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Oh God, oh God, it's sowed though.
From. From.
All right.
Oh!!
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath here today.

Please. It's your fault.
How, how is my fault?
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you arrived.
Yes? Well, there are a lot of things Carol has never done before I arrived.
Are you trying to be smart? A funny woman?
Do you know what your problem is? You are threatened by me.
Oh, am I threatened by you?
Yup.
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's all!
Enter here.
Come on.
My god, you guys, I do not believe you.
There are children who come into the world in this same building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should hear.
So just stop all the screams, just stop it!
Yes, Susan.
Do not let me do it again, I do not like my voice like this.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?

Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I did not! Who would have done it?
Son of a bitch!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Oh, did not I talk? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
You know sometimes good ideas are right in front of you, right?
Ok, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it could work. You know? The only problem is that Carl's acting is
The
Yes, that's the reason why I did not grow so big
Hey, can I have a piece of that cake?
Pizza!! We like pizza !! Go out!!!

Hey Monica, is there a customer who wants to complete the chef, should I let him in?
Of course, I love this part!
Come inside.
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment, yes.
But only right now. So you want to kiss again?
Of course, the New Year is only two weeks. It can wait?
No.
Me neither.
3, 2,
Joey, you do not have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yes, okay I just thought I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.

Wow ... Wow!
Yes.
Alright. Phoebe?
Ok ok.
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would like, um, peace in the world, no more hunger, good things for the rainforest ... And the biggest tits!
Yes, see ... you took mine. Chandler, and you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I would be omnipotent forever.
See, there's always a boy. "If I had a wish, I would like three more wishes".
Hey, Joey. Hello. Hello Friend.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
I probably kill myself!
..I'm sorry?
Hey, if Little Joey is dead, then I have no reason to live!
Joey, uh-
you

I'm sorry.
Joey, on stage!
Well, can you at least stay until the end of the game?
I mean, I'll go to the airport with you, I'll say goodbye.
Where are you Vic?
The flight lasts one hour. I have to go.
Vic! Vic!
In a minute !!
So this is it? Winner?
Yes, I guess it is.
Listen, I, ah, I have to say hello, and ... and I have to say it quickly because it's killing me.
One thing you need to know is that I will never forget you.
But you have things you have to do now, and me too.
So I'll go on this spaceship, and I'll go on Blargon 7 looking for alternative fuels.
But when I come back, in 200 years, you'll be gone for a long time.
But I will not have aged at all.
So you tell your great-grandmother to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I want to meet her.
So long, Vic!

I have to say
Via Nooo! The most romantic song that has ever been
See, I_I think what Elton John wrote, um, that guy
What song was that, Phoebe?
Hi Monica!
Hey Mon!
Hey Mon!
Oh my God, did you sleep?
No.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Yes, he finally stopped crying yesterday, but then he found one of Richard's cigar stubs on the terrace, then.
Oh, okay, that explains.
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this loud, creaky sound, so I thought it was okay like a mouse or an opossum.
But then I understood where a mouse or an opossum would get the money to make the phone call.

So, buddy, are you going to play with me tonight?
You know what, I do not know how much I'll feel comfortable to see how hot the sex is between a boy and your girlfriend.
Yes, I know but
Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
Hey!
Hey Mon! Do you want some pancakes?
Did you make pancakes?
Yup! Take a plate.
All right.
No-no, stay there. Approach.
Ok, ok, but do not worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,
Listen, we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come here.
Oh yeah!

Yes, if the hole was sandwiched.
Yes, the hero's sandwiches.
Well, you all know I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in the war in any way.
But you know what?
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.
Not you Joey.

Oh my good God
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite dishes. Tonight, n. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut hot dogs.
Look, you've done enough! All right? You have to stop it now.
I will do it! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you gave me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
The way you look like tonight
You're just the sweetest.
No! You're the sweetest!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
What?
I'm checking the restaurant with Pete.
Oh, Monica, I'm so excited for you.
Wait wait wait! Wait!!

So honey, this threesome, umm, I mean how-how will you start to find
Ooh, I actually made a list of all the women I know who could do this!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone did their homework.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is there twice, but it's true
Oh I know. You know, just ... just talking about it is making me a little sick
Oh me too.

and then, we could have gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Ross, it would not have been possible.
But having a dove to place the ring on the finger would not have been a problem?
It was really fun to be married to you tonight.
Yes! IS! And it was the easiest $ 400 I've ever done.
Okay Ross, I can, uh, can I ask you something?
Yes.
That proposal, to the planetarium
I know, I know it was stupid.
Are you kidding?!
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!
It was really wonderful!
Did you just make it up?
No, I actually thought about it when, when we were going out.
That's how I imagined I'd ask you to marry me.
Well, it would have been very hard to say no.
It's a good thing I did not do it, because it looks like it would have been a very expensive wedding. OK Goodnight
Good night
Even if the sidecar had a windshield so the hair did not get messed up?
I'll think about it.
That's all I'm asking for

You guys! They were bananas, cream and beef! I - I can not believe you ate it so you do not feel bad!
In fact, I-I did not eat mine. It is still in the bathroom.
No, it's not, I ate it.
Well, we left ours in Monica's room.
No, I understand and I have yours too.

Okay, we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mother and father, and I really do not know what happened with that.
And I'm so happy there are no problems.
All right, I'm actually in the hiring committee, so there will be at least one friendly face.
Ohh! Is fantastic!
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the
Really?!
No-ho-ho!
Yes.
I mean, no-no-no-no-no, do not worry, I'm sure that with your qualifications you will not need to sleep with a guy to get that job.
Although, I may need some conviction.
Good, me, umm
Making fun of! God, I feel wild today!

My God! Chandler just left!
Yes, but maybe that's not what we think. Maybe it's telling Monica that I'm sorry I drank the last milk.
Or maybe he - he was writing to tell him - that he changed his name, you know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I think it means that he went out of his mind and left!
Do not be so negative! Good God! Is not it possible that Sorry is sitting in there now?
All right. Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What we will do?
Look, okay, I will, I'll have to go look for him and bring him back!
All right?
You - make sure that Monica does not find out, ok?
All right.
All right
I will do it, I will find it.

Hey!
Hello! Hey!
Guys, do you know any cute guys?
Well, of course I do it! My good friend Joey here.
Oh sorry. Thanks Chandler.
However, there is this great charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren has bought a table, so I have to go
What is the charity?
I do not know, something that is tree or disease ... Ralph mumbles a lot.
Ralph mumbles when you're not paying attention?
Yes! It's strange. But the thing is need to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Hey!
What are you guys doing next?
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get my hair cut.
We do?
I want to see what he wants first.
All right.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! Are not you Elizabeth's dad ?!
Come on guys, I ... I really want this guy to like me.
It would really help if you guys were here to make me look good.
Obviously we will help you! Yes! We will be here!
Thank you!
We know how difficult those parent / teacher conferences can be.

Oh hello! How are you doing?
I'm fine. I have to go to the police station and look at the mug shots.
Oh.
Thanks for finishing me, guys.
Label?
Y-Are you going?
We did not, and we did not have the chance to talk.
Uh, so, where did you say you come again?
Colorado.
Ah, what's the use?
Listen, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
All right.
Ah, I-I should never have said what I said.
Hey, you know what?
It does not matter how I feel.
I mean we work together, so nothing could ever happen between us, and what I'd like to do is go to work on Monday and ... and never talk about it again, okay?
Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I knew it, I scared you.
No you did not. The only thing that scared me was that you said nothing would ever happen between us.
Really?
Yes, so please do not dismiss me for doing so.
Ok, well, this is one less thing we have to do on Monday.

Take it! GET! Take it! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, you're a friend!
See friend, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!
It's open!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!

I'm so glad I held this chair for me!
Yes me too.
Hey, how's the miracle chair?
Beautiful.
Yes? Wow! You know, this thing has speakers in the headrest!
No, really?
Yes! You can connect it to your TV
My chair is taken care of.

Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study last night?
Yup! Yes i did it.
So do Iceberg!
G-sharp.
sol
What?! I did not touch a guitar!
No, but you're questioning my method!
No, I'm not questioning, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
Thank you.
You know, none of my other students thought I was stupid.
Your other student, it was you!
Yeah, well, you know, maybe you just need to try a little more!
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Right here!
Here!
Andy Cooper, teaches guitar and looks at ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little boy and
Well! Go to learn from your qualified instructor! But do not come crying to me when everyone is tired and tired of hearing you play
"The worst man in the whole damn city."
Oh good! Take his part!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey has to work. Now let's go!
Hey!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have it back when the five pages are finished! Ahh!

Hello!
Hello.
Hello. Umm, I think there's something we really need to talk about.
I think we do it. Why do not we enter? Look uh, I know why you're here.
You do?
Yes, and to save you from any embarrassment, I think maybe I should talk first.
All right.
All right. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. This was a devil of a swing is not it?
What?
I mean, look, that ... that night we had fun and definitely passionate, but do not you think it's better if we're friends?
Seriously. What?!
All right.
All right.
You know what?
If you wish, we can do it again.
I mean, I'd agree with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.
Ok, you know what? Can I, can I speak now?
Oh sure.
I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Ok, when you're ready. And you're the father, by the way ... but you understood it

We should play football provocatively more often. Maybe there's a similar league we could join or something like.
I know!
Yup! Wow, well, that was easy. Okay, you-go.
All right.
All right.
Okay, you know, you know when you're in bed with a woman.
Mah.
And, ah, you know, you're joking with her.
And you have all these mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl in Xerox's place.
With the navel ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, and then suddenly your mom comes to mind.
And you like 'Mom, get out of here!'
You know, but of course, later, you can not think of anything else, and you can not, you know, stop doing what you're doing.
So it's a bit like, you are, you know it.
You know ... you do not know!
Your mum, what are you telling me, are you telling me about your mother, what's wrong with you?
You said...
I said '

Oh!
Look at Emma!
I can not decide who looks more like you or Rachel?
Oh, what are you kidding? It's beautiful, it's all Rachel.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why are not you two together yet?
I do not know.
I know, because you're not in that place.
Which would be good, except you are totally.
It's complicated okay?
Yes, it's true. Yes, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no correct answer.
Look, we were together.
All right?
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.
It's only if, if we get together again and it does not work, I could never do it to Emma.
I mean she-she thinks everything- Oh, that's me.
What do they put something in the water in this place?
Since Rachel and I are really doing it, we're doing really good now.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you could ruin it.
Yes exactly.
Right. Or you could get everything you wanted when you were fifteen.

God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have
You do not have a
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just have to relax, okay? I just need to relax, okay? I just need to relax
What-what are you doing ?! You're fine, it's not funny! Stop riding!
I'm not kidding, okay? I'm walking around.
Uh Oh.
Ok, stay calm. Nothing will happen to you, you're not in trouble.
Really? Do you think so?
I was talking to myself! You're going down!

Hey honey! I missed you today!
Oh yeah?
Yes. What do you want to do tonight?
Oh, well ... Maybe we could ...
Ok, trying to light me up by messing up?
Know your audience!
Also, tomorrow we are doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep the tadpoles in the tank.
Do we really need to take those tests?
Honey, we're trying to have a baby for over a year.
I think it's a good idea to find out if it's all right. Just some routine tests.
But I do not want to do it in a cup!
Oh, bye Max! Hey, do you know everyone?
No. Did you see David?
No, no, it was not around.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack up. Let's go to Minsk.
Minsk?
Minsk. It is in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
So when, when are you leaving?
First of January.

Did you want to see Professor Geller?
Yes, yes! Please come in.
Oo-oo!
Pretty awesome! Except I had a little attitude on the part of the robot.
Damn those robots, they should be ours
In any case, it was not the robot, it was the boy who controlled it.
Yes, he does not like me.
He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
turn down the sandwich just when I reached one!
Ohh!
Well, why do not you fire him?
Maybe I'll have to, I hate doing it, but I'm the star!
You know?
There is a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat from the floor.
I'm sorry.
Joey Tribbiani.
Joe! I'm glad to have found you, I had an audition for you!
Wow!
The fact is that it is a little bit about Q.T.
The actor who plays the part does not know he could be fired.
He is the protagonist of a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I'm the main character in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!
Uh Oh!

Oh good God! If you want a child so bad, just steal it!
What's happening to you? Since when are you so crazy for children?
I'm not crazy for children. I'm crazy about us.
What?
Listen, we've always talked about having children one day.
I'm not saying it should be right now, but I'm starting to think we can handle it.
They were good.
We are really good.

Oh, did you get it ?!
Uh Huh.
WH-What did he say?
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda." Well, of course I could not give him my real name?
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw how it ended up here!
What do you think?
He will stop and talk with his daughter who has left!
What did you tell him?
Well, I said, I told him I was the executor of Francis's will and that I needed to talk to him, so I'll meet him at the cafe later.

Oh yes, of course.
Ok, in about ten seconds you'll see him kiss me.
And in about five seconds you'll see why.
Did Ross ever tell you about when I went backpacks around Western Europe?
Ok, get ready to see a little bit of beggin!
Oh, you came to Ross!
What?!
Now I'm so happy.
What are you talking about?!
You used the history of Europe!
This is the magical story you use when you want to have sex!
How do you know about that story?
How can I do
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from a guy!
Someone!!
No. No, he told me that his name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams !!

How are we, guys ready?
Mum has already called this morning to remind me not to put on my hair. Did you know that my ears are not my best feature?
Some days is all I can think of.
Hello, sorry I'm late, I could not find the orientation.
Oh ... ok, fine.
But ... um ...
I have only one question for you, um ...
When we go out, walk, run, say hello or walk ...
Stop it, stop it! Speak slow but could pee quickly! OK let's go!!

I can not believe! How far has it gone?
Well, Alexandra was
Oh, has a name?
Phoebe, do not be angry!
Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on, Chandler, let's go!
Well, Phoebe I thought I would ... Yes, what the hell.

Well!
Oh that's good. Maybe he will hear you and he will pull the cord.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Are you sure you did not break it because it really hurts?
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry!
Hey!
Hey!
I took my s!
That we can celebrate later.
To celebrate.

Ok, Paulo, why do not you go get dressed, and then go your way, ok, bye bye.
Rachel, how did it happen?
I do not know, I just ran into him last night.
Where is it?
In his apartment. Is this juice?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you downloaded him because he hit Phoebe?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
I licked my arm, what?
It is breast milk.
So?
Phoebe, this is the juice, squeezed by a person.
what's the problem?
What have you just done?
Ok, people would stop drinking breast milk?
You will not even taste it?
No!
Even if you only pretend it's milk?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child.

Aww!
It is funny.
Hey Phoebe, could you please do not put my feet on my new old sheet?
Oh sure! Noo!
Ohh !!
My pharmacy table !!!
What?!
Noooooo !!
Ross, where did you get it ?!
I understood
Oh my God, Phoebe,
Wow! Oh my God, well if they have torn our table our must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Oh yes.
Well, this does not even smell like opium.
Of course not, it smells like wine, you've overthrown! And thank you for destroying my paper by the way.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.

Like her?
It's too early to say. It's resting, which is a good sign.
How are your hair?
I will not lie to you, Ross, it does not look good.
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped curling.
Can we see it?
Your hair looks too beautiful, I think it would upset her. Ross, why do not you come inside.
Yes.
How are you?
Obviously the package appeals to adults and children.
Ross, you're stupid. I tried it, it's not a big deal. Tasting it
That would be no.
Come on. It does not have a bad taste.
Yes, it's a bit sweet, like ... uh ...
Melon juice.
Exactly.
Did you taste it? You tasted it.
Uh Huh.
Oh, you tasted it.
You can go on saying it, but it will not stop being true.
Give me the bottle. Give me the towel.

I still do not understand why Greg and Jenny give us a false number.
You know, if they knew what they were doing, they probably did not even give you real names.
Ok, maybe people give false numbers, but they do not give false names.
Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Queen Philange.
I still do not understand, we did not do anything wrong.
I know! Even if you've told a lot of jokes.
I thought you said those jokes were fun. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
Well, maybe they were all your questions.
And my questions?
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot that itches like crazy.
Oh, I understand that.
Wow! I can usually get to know a girl a little better before you leave me a spoon.
Relax, it's not like we're bifurcating.

Look at him! Ohhh! The wallpaper is a little faded, all right. The carpet is a bit slow. Solid wood floors !!
Hey!
Hello.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
I know!!!
So, I'm here, ready to play.
All right.
I've brought some stuff for the house, so take a look. Ha-ha.
What is this?
That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
Not one who can pee on the roof.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
And this is in case the house sneezes?
No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
I do not want a ghost.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you have it, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian cemetery.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste and an ancient Indian cemetery? It would never happen.
Ok, obviously you do not know much about the US government.
Hey!
Hello.
I need to talk to you!
Of course, what's up?

All right, I just changed in thirty seconds so I could be alone with him. You'd better look for it.
Please, I'm not going to anything.
Well, if you do not, I will.
Please, do you want to go?
I would like to!
Hey, guys, guys, have you seen my new china cabinet ?!
Uh Huh.
Look look.
Ooohhhh !!
And e!
Ahhhh !!
Hey, my father's house does it!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Well, the film was great, the dinner was great and there's nothing better than a cold and buzzing evening in New York.
Hmm.
Of course, I did not like anything about it, because Joanna is like that

All right. It's Emma.
Emma! To see? I do not want it
Take it.
What?
It is clearly an emma.
Oh honey, but you love that name.
Yes, but I love you more.
Besides, you know, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.
I mean Oh, bye Emma.
Yes its you.
You're our little Em.
Oh what is that honey?
What?
Oh, do you want a little cousin?
Do you want a cousin right now?
!

Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, charlatan!" I'm happy all the time!
Good try.
Wait wait wait!
Look, Monica
Look!
This will not work.
I bet it will work!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
Anything! I said, I said "You're so beautiful" and then I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can not believe!
No I did not!
Yes, you did it!
No I did not!
You love Me!
No I do not! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that!

Hi Greg?
Hi, is this Monica from the plane?
Listen, the number you gave me 853-5 This is their old number!
Jenny has given us since they moved!
Jenny! It's so Jenny!
Hey, listen, how would you like to be together?
Say next Saturday?
Ok, what about Sunday?
All right, the week after?
The week after?
Do you know what Greg?
You know what?
We are good, interesting, fun people with

Hey, Chandler! Do you know what a girl you went to college with who-who became a director?
Oh yes, Dana Keystone. He was in my movement class.
What is a movement class?
It's Chandler's way of pretending not to take mimicry.
Oh well listen, anyway he's directing the new film by Al Pacino. You have to audition me!
Oh, I do not know the man. I did not talk to her in ten years.
I'm.
Joey, what are you talking about? You are an exceptional actor.
Do you really think that?
Uh, how can you even ask that question ?!

Ross! Give it a try. (He's carrying a problem of
Oh, ok, I'm doing another one!
This also does not hurt ... Ooh, yes, it does!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ooh!
Oh, I was hoping it would be like that.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel?
All right. Hey, but better to make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the camera? Beautiful!!

Yes I love you. OK Bye! Hello!
Hello!
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. It should be here by now!
Oh, honey, do not worry. He will do it in time.
Yes.
I guess I set up the camera to try and seduce Joey.
But unfortunately I could not be enticed.
Unbelievable! I mean, did you really take Joey's underwear ?! Why? Why should you do it ?!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I chase guys and keep their underwear.
Well, I think we all learned something about who is disgusting and who is not.
Eh?
All right, now, I'm going back to my bucket.
I eat only the skin, so the chicken is up for grabs.

I did not find anything from Joey - Hey-hey, oh hey!
Oh, okay, they gave you the old times prices.
Yes.
Well, what period does it come from?
Uh, it's a long time ago. Like the times of a time. You know?
Yes yes I do it.
God, oh it's just perfect!
Wow!
I bet he also has a great story behind him.
Did they say anything to you?
As you know where it came from
Yup! As far as I know, this is from White Plains.
White plains. Oh, it seems such a magical place.

So, do not you still think I'm the boyfriend's material?
Eh?
I saw you watching me during the game last night.
I, umm, shut up!
"Hello, Phoebe and Ursula." I'll miss you. "Post scriptum Your mother lives in Montauk." You just wrote this!
Well, it's practically the essence. Good, except for the poem. Read the poem, right?
Noooo !!
All right, wait!

Rachel, it will happen. Chandler will move here.
But I
No-no, wait!
Just let me finish, ok?
This is not something we just have, we just impulsively decided in Vegas, this is something we both really want.
And it
IS? Really?
Yes sweetie.
I mean we're not, will not we live together anymore?
No.
What? My God! I will miss you a lot!
I'll miss you!
I mean, it's the end of an era!
I know!

Why are all the cups of coffee you have on the bottom?
Oh. That's how Monica can keep track. This way if one of them is missing, she can be like, 'Where is the number 27?!'
You know what?
It was not so.
Ok, so what you had with Rachel is what I have with Alice.
Now, wh-what, how is it?
It's so beautiful, it's like that, it's just because being with her is much better than not being with her.
Yes, yes.
Why can not I find it?
Do not ask me, I had it and I blew it up!
Well, I want it!
You can have it!
I do not know, maybe I can not. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Oh, no! No!
Man is out there! I saw it! I got it!!
So keep it tight !!
All right, man!
All right, congratulations, lucky bastard!

Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
To push!
Push them out, push them out, stronger, stronger.
Push them out, push them out, go!
We take that ball and we really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
Come on- I was alone ... yes, right.
To push!
To push!

All right.
Ross, did not you say there was an elevator here?
Uhh, yes, I did it, but it's not there. Ok, here we are.
All right, go left. Left! Left!
Ok, you know what? There is no left, left!
Oh ok, lift it straight over your head!
Straight over your head!
You can do it!
You can do it!
All right.
You got it right?
Oh, ok, I understand.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just that I never even do it
Howard is the
Yes, but I'm alone too, my friend.
Ok, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ugh, can you believe it?
Yes. I really like your glasses.

Ohh!
What?
He kicked! I think the kid kicked!
My God!
Oh no wait, oh no, the rubber band on my underwear broke.
My God! I overslept! I had to be on set half an hour ago! I have to get out of here!
Oh wait, Joey, you can not go that way! You stink!
Look, I know I'm asleep before I can take a shower and now I have no time!
I'm only ten blocks away, if I run, I can do it.
You're coming across the room! I'm Chandler.
Hello.
Hello.
You're sorry if I do
No Please.
So, what are you working on?
I speak in my sleep
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
So why do not you give me your number?

Previously on Friends.
I do not know exactly. It's ... it's like fighting.
Oh?!
Yes, but without the costumes.
Oh.
And it's not false, it's totally brutal.
Yes, they're two guys in a ring, and the rules are: "They are
So you can love, bite and pull people's hair and things?
Yes, anything goes, except ah, eye creaking and catching fish.
What is fish hooking?
Huh, what's hooking fish ... Thanks friend, it would have been really hard to describe. What is this taste?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just had a duck bath.

Oh, Bob, it was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to not scream your name.
Well, this makes me feel so good.
It was just so embarrassing and bumpy.
Bumpy?
Well, maybe he had a kind of new, beautiful style that is not familiar to you.
And maybe you have to get used to it.
Well, there was not really much time to get used to, you know what I mean?

Crossing! Oh! Crossing! Oh! Hello! Hello! No! Right! Crossing!
Oh well, it's not that bad.
Yes, most of the damage is quite contained in the bedrooms.
Oh!
My God!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
I'm sorry?
Joey! Is working! You would look
Oh, how bad is it?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that is not burned is a donkey. What do I do
How's your room, Rach?
Everything is ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
It's not mine?
Well! Sorry for your loss!
So, you will not be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Wow! Oh, ok, look, man, I am
Yes, they can stay with us.
Did you understand what started Mr. Mr. Fireman?
There is so much pressure.
I do not mean offense, but what you guys do is very different.
I do not know if you would understand.
Yes, none of us has to deal with the pressure on our work.

Well, Phoebe, we have to do something!
Well you know.
I mean, there's no way Joey can make it in time.
So I will go through the hotel and see if there are any other marriages going on.
All right. Oh, but do not tell them that Monica is pregnant because they curl up on that.
All right.
All right.

What's all this for you guys who fight ?! Is it really over a room ?! I mean, it's so silly!
Ross, we can handle it.
Well, apparently not, and I can not just stand and watch two people who I feel very bad about something that's so silly.
I mean, enough of stupidity!
Well, why do not you tell her to stop being silly!
Ok ok!
Two good points, look, I've known you for a long time, and I've never seen any of you two million people as happy as you've been since you were together.
Do you really want to throw everything away on a room?
It's so silly.
Now, what is more important, love or nonsense?
Well, we like nonsense, but we also have a soft spot for love.
Love is the best medicine.
This is a laugh.
Why are you doing it?
I do not know.
All right! All right! Now, Chandler, you want to live with Monica, right?
Yes I do it.
And Mon, you want to live with Chandler, right?
Yup.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!

Oh.
But not me. Me, Phoebe.
Well, I'm not at all surprised that they feel that way.
You're not? See, that's why you're so exceptional!
In reality it is, it is enough, you know, a typical behavior when you have this type of dysfunctional group dynamics.
You know, this kind of co-dependent, emotionally tired, sitting in your stupid cafeteria with your stupid cups that, I'm sorry, might even have nipples on them, and you're like everything 'Oh, define me!
Definiscimi!
Love me, I need love!
'.

Have you done it before?
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Take only a big, big swing.
Now do not hold back.
and Phoebe takes a wooden baseball bat and starts swinging as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Hey!
Hey Hey Hey!
What are you doing?
We're just celebrating that Joey has returned her health insurance.
Oh alright.
Yes! Sure! Yup! Oh, you know what? If I heard a shot now, I would throw my body on you.
Oh yeah? Well, maybe you and I should take a walk in a bad neighborhood.
All right!
All right.
Hello!
Hello!
Cut out Ross! I hate having to save your life and kick your ass the same day!

Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yes.
Listen, I'd prefer it if you did not call me Joey.
Since I do not know anyone here, I thought it would be nice to try a nickname of cool work.
Hey, dragon! Here are your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There is as if there were 300 dollars in this!
Yes, people become quite generous during the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight pants.
All right.
Waiters could gather around to hear tonight's specials?
Ok, first there is a Chilean sea bass prepared with a mango flavor on an envelope: why is not anyone writing them?
Because we can remember them.
Why will everything end up making fake specials and getting me to cook like you did last night?

Hey. When you guys are kids and you played
I've always been Joanne.
Question. It was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighborhood?
Ewww! Oh! He is the king of mattresses!
Booo !!
Do not look at honey. Change channel! Change channel!
Wait! Wait! I want to see it. After I have divorced him, half of that kingdom will be mine.
What a saw!
Oh, I can not believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I know!
And four ninety-nine for a pillow top set, who cares about the divorce, those kids will sell themselves.
And I'm upset about you by the way.

You had to do it, right? You can not leave it alone.
Four percent It's fine. I recommend more than that when there is an insect in my food.
Ross, it was two of you who got along tonight. Oh, you would only see my chiropractor, yes.
Yes, I go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Phoebe, what are you doing?
I'm, I'm going crazy!
Monica believed me with something and she should not have!
All right, I have not lived here for a while, so I have to ask you something.
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Um. Yes.
I'm
Okay, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is solvable, if we act quickly, okay.
So, I will invite him to do a brunch tomorrow and you can enjoy it.
Look, honey, I tried to make it nice, it does not work.
Ok, look, Ross, I realize my father is hard, but that's why you have to be the biggest man here.
You feel sweetness, I could be the biggest man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge giant man, and it would not make any difference, except I could take your father and say 'I like me!
Like me, little doctor!
Ok, well, can not you try Ross again? For me? For me?
Rachel, a brunch will not solve anything. You have to face it, okay, we'll never get along.
Ok, well, you'll do it too, okay.
Because I already have a mother and a father who can not be together in the same room, ok, I do not want to have a separate room for you too!
!
Ok, ok, ok I'll take the bagels.

Okay, Joey, you know that since you're returning all this stuff right after the audition, will you have to wear underwear?
Okay, so you'd better show me a little bit then too.
Ok, something is missing. Ooh, I know! Umm, ok
Really? A bag?
It is not a bag! It is a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's purse.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all men wear them in the spring catalog. Look. Look,
Look,
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.
No! No Joey! Unisex.
Well, I will not say no to this.

So, did you tell your parents?
No, but everything will be fine, they are very nice, my brother is so sincere. . .
Here it is.
You know one thing, I only have one more question, er, if you had understood it before, er, I'd been around, you think I'd be the one.
.
.
no, um, I'm sorry, do not tell me, I do not think any of the two answers would make me feel better.
I love you Phoebe.
So your brother is right? Seriously.

Hey!
Hello.
I just came to not release anything. So that weekend made me sick, eh?
Yes, he did it.
So, I guess it's over.
What?
Well, you know, you and I, we had to finish sooner or later.
Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Chandler who is crazy!
If you give up every time you argue with someone you'll never be with longer than-Ohhh!
So, this is not over?
You are so cute!
No.
No, it was a fight.
You're dealing with it and move on!
It's nothing strange.
Really? All right. Great!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
Are we in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.
All right.

Hello!
So you like short hair better.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Can I tell you a little secret?
Yes!
I want to keep one.
Ohh, I'll be on the news!

Oh please.
What? Honey.
Oh, I am, my side still hurts when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh God, I'm so sorry.
I know.
Ow !!
Oh God!
Hey guys! Guess what?
Do you have a job on a boat on the river?
You know what I did not wear this suit for a year because I hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so ...
Oh I understand, so this dress is making a point.
Right.
Now that you are your property, you are free to look stupid as you like.
Do you like it, do not you?
Oh absolutely. I like even more about you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Yes, come here!
What ... what did you want to tell us?
Yes. Oh! Did you invent the cotton gin ?!
Ok, goodbye!

Hey, I got one! I got one!
Hello!
Hello.
Oh uh, up or down?
Oh down, please. I-I hate being a ball player can I do it?
Could you please press also?
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg too.
Oh yeah? How did yours happen?
Well, it's a long story.
It's a bit embarrassing.
Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
And you?
Car crash.
Oh.
Oh, let me guess that an idiot on the phone was not paying attention?
Yeah. Me. Oh hey, it's me. Hey, I'll take it, you're just visiting someone.
Uh-huh, yes.
Well, if you sometimes know and maybe you might want to visit someone else
Oh yeah! I would like ... I'd like to.
I'm in the middle
Wait! What?! No!! Lift!! No!
Uh, you have to press the button.

Oh, we did it, and you still have all your lamps.
Oh, I did not calculate the room tax.
Oh man, do not worry, I found a waitress's car unattended. We are far ahead of the game.
My God.
What?
There is something new in the bowl.
Look, we have enough, just go away.
No, but I want ... I want the pine cones!
There is a forest right outside.
It's not the same.
Ok, go fast!
Thanks for a lovely stay.
Oh, my maple candies!

Oh my God, what happened?
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He ... pulled me ... the ... bed!
Wow! Turning looks like fun.
Oh, I'd like to. No, you know he was just trying out the Ross Hug & Roll thing.
Ross's what?
You know what, where he hugs you and makes you roll away and ... Oh ... my ... God.

Ops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Yup!! Yup! Yup! Yup!! That's my dad, that's Frank! Yes! I'm sorry that I enjoy everything.
Go easy - if you want, there are cookies on the counter or, or - sangria! I can make sangria!
No-no, I'm sorry. The cookies are good, thanks.
Oh.
Well, umm, anyway, I was, I looked for my father, um, did you hear something from him or did you see him?
Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I think we lost everyone's knowledge after high school.
Oh ok. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Ohh, good. We knew we were always together, in fact we had a nickname for the three of us.
Oh what? What was that?
The three losers.
Oh, poor Lily.
Oh, you know, I ... I heard about what happened, it must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother like that.
Yes, no, it was great.

Well, we've already tried to feed it, to change it, to burp it, oh try this!
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Well, here's something, say try to hold the baby close to your body and then swing it quickly from side to side.
Ok.
It worked!
Oh oh no, I just stopped for a little puke.
Oh come on, what will I do, hours have passed and will not stop crying.
Umm, she Rach, it's not true, her.
Yes, I'm not so sure.
Oh my God, I'm losing my mind.
Yes, I'm not kidding, this shows that it's not good to have sex with Ross!

Well, you're not.
Oh, it's so easy for you, I mean, you're not married, you can have sex with whoever you want!
Yes I can! And do not think that I do not do it, because I do it! I mean all the time, do you know?
Monica. You did it, did you do well?
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm a 30 year old virgin?
My God! You are a virgin of 30 years!
Say it louder, I do not think the boy has heard you all the way!
It's not like, I have no chance.
I mean, you know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
I'm seeing this guy, Roger, all right?
It's not perfect, but I think maybe I should do it.
You know, give it my flower.
My God!! Just do it!! Honey, you waited
You know what? You are right?!
Yup!!
I mean that sex does not have to be a big deal!
There should not be all these rules and restrictions!
You know, people should be able to sleep with whoever they want, every time
Rachel! I'll never think it's right for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!

Push pushing!
They were here!
Where have you been?
Long story, honey.
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need ... Excuse me, could I have this?
Come on then.
Behind the shoulders of my brother? ... it's exactly the kind of crazy thing you will not hear from me.

So, I heard, you hate me!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about this.
A little bird told me something about you that would rip your arm and throw it at me.
And do you have a 'hate' from that ?! You're making a big jump there ...
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, we have to do something for our little situation here, Joey.
So, this is my idea: you and I spend some time together.
But what will you do ...
For Chandler!
Guess, I auditioned!
Awww, one of my students auditioned. I'm so proud.
I was wondering if you would have thought to instruct me for this?
You bet! What is the part?
Oh, it's great, it's a role

Hello! Hello! Hello. He umm, has anyone seen Chandler?
I thought it was with you.
He ... he was with me, um, we're playing a little game, you know? Hide and seek.
You can not ask, son, it's a cheat.
You're right, thank you for keeping me honest father.
Well, it's better if you do not come here. He can not see the bride with the wedding dress.
As I remember when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
But that was after the wedding, it is not bad luck.
Honey, it's not good luck.
My God! Monica!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler?
Great. It's going great. Do not worry about Chandler.
Are you OK?
Uh Huh.
Yeah baby!
I'm really glad you guys are okay, but I keep thinking about what would happen if ... if you two really got hooked.

So, we did well at the strip club, right?
Oh yes, it was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress is sacking to teach the third grade!
I can not believe! He has not called yet.
Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
What, he does not like Josh?
No I do not know.
All right, I'm about to put my sweats back on.
Oh no!
Wait!
Wait!
Okay, you know what, you were right, you were right.
We were not really good at being boys, but do you know why?
Because we are girls.
Phoebe, his music could not
Thank you thank you.
Yes, I lost it.
You know, I will not play anymore, do you want, can you finish my set?
After that? Yes! No, I mean if I can help.
Yes, how could I
What?
I played bad guys on purpose.
Ok, so you were trying to play bad all this time.
Yes, no, just that last song.

Oh, I was thinking of having people for the game.
Oh yes, who is playing?
The players.
Someone seems to miss being the landlady.
Please, it is a relief what it is, it is what it is.
All right, take your plate out!
Oh.

Nothing?
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he did not hear from him again. I-I-I talked again with Chandler's parents!
Did you tell them that he was missing?
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Sure enough, they both think I'm interested in them.
Whose is it?
I do not want to say
Oh come on! I do not care! Come on! Whose is it?
Diane Keaton.

Phoebe! Come on! Here we go! Come on! Why are not you still dressed?
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check it.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you something, if you get ready now I'll let you play at the wedding.
Really?!
Oh, it's so exciting!
Thank you!
Thanks Mon!
Oh, but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to fight you a bit.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
All right.
I will take all the others, finally we can start to celebrate my- I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past.

My best shoes, so good with me.
I wear them every day.
Down at the heel, holes in the toes.
It does not matter what people say.
The best friends of my feet, friends until the end.
With them I'm a hot girl.
Although late at night, little light, I ....
I got into something icky.
The sticky shoes, the sticky shoes always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I will .... I avoid the ..... pillleeeee.

God, it will be so strange when I come home and you're not here.
You know?
Not anymore Joey and Chan.
No more J and C.
"Do you want to go to Joey and Chandler?"
"I can not, it's not there."
Look, I'll be on the other side of the corridor, we can still do all the same things.
Yes, but we will not be able to get up in the middle of the night and make those long chats about our feelings and the future.
We did not do it once.
Hello.
Hey!
Hello.
So, I told Rachel we'll be just the two of us.
Oh yeah? Well, how did you get it?
Very well. Yes. Surprisingly well. Yes, he did not cry. She was not angry or sad.
Uh Huh.
I'm not going to do it.

Ok, if you need the suction, it's in my closet on the left side. Ah, the trash bags are next to the refrigerator
Ok, okay, but Rachel will be here too, can not I ask you these things?
Yes, okay, try it!
All right! Let's do it!
Woo-hoo !!
Yes, cheerie-o!
Little London!
Hello!
Hello!
Monica? What time is it?
Uhh, 9.
But it's dark.
Well, it's because you're always sleeping at noon, silly! Here's how it looks like 9.
I guess I'll be washed up then. Look at that dawn.
I'm
I also know.
Hey!
Do you know what happens if we left for a whole weekend?
You know, we would not have interruptions and we could stay naked all the time.
All weekend? It's all naked.
Yes, I can say that I have a conference and you can say that you have a chef thing.
Oh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair they have in Jersey!
Okay, you know that even if you're not. Here we go.
Wait! What about Joey?

Oh, um, there's even a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
It seems that two people really appreciate the Dewey decimal system.
I'm so sorry!
Sorry!
You have not brought

Hey!
Hello!
Oh, you know, Kash, I loved it the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
Okay, I just have to stop first from my house.
To register the game? You do it every time Ross, you are
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment has become available.
Oh, are you changing apartment?
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Yes, but when the baby arrives, he will want to move.
She is?
Yes, you did not expect him to live there with a baby, right?
I do not think I really thought about it.
Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
Damn!

See what I got! See what I got! See what I got! Can you believe that they do it for small people?
Small people from the village
Ok, look at this. This is my favorite
Oh, it's so sweet!
I know! Phoebe will like to dress them in these!
Huh. Except that Phoebe will not be the one who will dress them.
Because he will not be able to keep the children.
My God! We are launching the most depressing baby shower ever!
Wait a minute!
Unless we give her all the presents she can use after she's finished pregnant.
Umm similar, normal coffee, tequila.
Oh, and someone can take those leather pants he's always wanted!
Oh, he will worship it!

Okay, you two are asking the Court for a cancellation?
Yes, your honor, and here they are, are forms, all compiled.
So, based on your petition, you're looking for a cancellation based on the fact that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Well, I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is an intravenous addict.
What?!
Oh yes, heroin and crack.
The crack is not even an intravenous drug!
Well, you would know.
Now he also says that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh come on!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
No!
Phoebe just because I'm alone does not mean I want to go naked.
I mean, you live alone, do not go around naked.
Uh Huh! Why do you think it takes so long to answer the door?

I know, I lied! I did not want him to think I was a terrible mother! I can not even see my baby!
Oh sure, come here! Of course you can! Uh, look, look here, it's-is-is, it's right there.
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. Now I see it.
Really?
No, I do not see it!
Come on! Come on! Here, okay, do you understand that? This little thing looks like a peanut?
Yes.
Honey, that's it.
That's all? Well, I saw it! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
You are welcome.
Wow! I can not believe it's our baby.
Yes, this is our baby.

Gin.
We were playing Gin? You know, if we were a couple, we could play this naked game.
You will stop!
All right. All right.
Ok, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you.
But you'll always be the guy who pee on me.

Hey!
Hey!
Let me tell you about this girl I scored last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Hey, look at me, I'm a whore!
So, do you want to do something tonight?
Oh, I can not Dr. Roger is coming back.
Oh.
Oh right!
Right!
Because you're still seeing him, and he's a good boy.
I mean, I remember a time when
Are you OK?
Yes! Totally! Totally, and you?
Great! It is so incredible! I mean, the last time Dr. Roger arrived, I was
I bet he can.
You know, I do not have an appointment, but I certainly could use a physicist. Are you sure you're comfortable?
Oh yeah! Yes! Do not worry about me, I'll be fine!

You cleaned your clothes. This is the important part.
Oh, I guess. Except now everything seems a little bit
Whoa, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We had this cart.
Yes, but what if it is not? What happens if there is a reason why we can not have a baby?
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are planning to have children. I'm sure everything will be fine.
oh, oh, yes, okay, thank you.
I can not believe I did not even think about that.
I guess I'm so worried about having to ... come here and do ... 'that' ...
What, you can do it in a Taco Bell car park, but can not you do it in a doctor's office?
It was a "Wendy's !!"

... and then Zana, leave only a tear !!
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people I went to school with, because I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?
Like you, I do not even know where you work?
Yes.
Yes. Well, I think our second meeting will be a

Hey.
Hey!
So you stole my joke and stole my money.
Well, I was about to paste it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I'm a published writer.
Well, she will know that you stole the joke.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me over there?
Yes!
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway.
All right .
Here it is.
Ah, Gunther, I can not pay for it now because I'm not working, so I had to reduce some luxuries like, uh, to pay for things.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I do not know.
See, it's just, you see I was a regular on a soap opera, you know?
And to move from this to this, I only have Plus, I should wait on all my friends.
Ok, but the money is good, plus you can fix Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?

I have no name
Okay, so, what should we call you?
Okay, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
In no way are you cool enough to pull off Clint.
Okay, so which name is nice enough to pull out?
Umm, Gene.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
See you later, Gene.
Hi, Gene.
It's Clint!
What happens to Gene?

Welcome to Las Vegas.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Yes i did it. Thank you so much, it was excellent.
I hope you had a nice flight.
Oh, it was the best!

Oh, Larry.
Umm, do the health inspectors work on commission?
No, bribes.
It's okay to laugh, right?
Come on, Joey !!!
Rachel, I told you everything I knew last night!
Look, it's not a big deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I can not believe you would say it!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
No! I mean, let's go! This is a
I do not know.
Is she romantic with her?
I do not know.
They are in love?
I do not know.
You do not know anything.
Oh, I know one thing!
What?
They did it right there on the couch.

Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour and a lot of people who are less sick than my friend's.
I mean, that guy with his toe?
Who is sleeping with?
Oh, come on, Dora, do not be angry ...
I know we both said some things we did not mean, but that does not mean we do not love each other yet.
You know, I feel like I've lost it .. Ba-!

So you see, Molly, what people do not understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
So where did you study?
Oh, I did not go to college.
No, where did you study acting?
Molly ... people do not study acting ...
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us a minute?
Of course, I'm going to check on Emma.
Thank you.
The stable boy will never get the princess ??
What do you plan to do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
No ... the skin sticks to my ass.
You know, this is not right.
What makes you think that I'm going to sleep with her and then blow her away?
Eh?
Guys, can not you open your mind to the possibility that I really like her, and could I want something real?
Look, the truth is, I have not felt this way about anyone since Rachel, okay?
I did not think I could ever love again.
Come on! Joe!
Ok
Hi, is Molly here?
Yes, come inside. Molly?
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha. See you tomorrow.
Ok ... Well, Joey, I guess we have no problems.
It's as if my favorite fairy tale came true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!

And the beauty is that the character is from Naples, right?
Yes.
All my family comes from Naples!
Oh that's great! Ok, I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to, Leslie
Joey, this is the embarrassing part.
Oh!
Hey, right!
It's not a problem.
I understand well.
You must make sure you do not have horrible scars or tattoos.
Do not worry; I have nothing to hide.
So here you are, it's me.
One hundred percent natural!
I tell you, it never happened before.

This room is available.
All right!
OK wait!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Since I waited four women, this is four, one taller than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, I went and I went with their children!
I'm next!
It's my turn!
It's just right!
And if you bring a woman inside and she has her baby before me, I'll sue you!
Not this hospital, I denounce you!
And my husband is a lawyer!
Uh Rach
Back on that treasure case!
I do not think the next patient is very far.
Ok, well then bring it in
OMG!!!

Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy and that guy. And that guy! They are all huge!
They do not look bigger than me!
Well, maybe it's because you're closer to you. So you seem bigger from where you are.
I'm just about to say hello to the boys. All right?
All right.
All right.
Hello.
Whoa! I liked it
Ok, I know what I have to do. I have to go to Ross Ross. You know, Red Ross!
I absolutely do not know what you're talking about.
Come on! The moment when we were all waiting in line
You know, you guys were much more available when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Phoebe, listen, if you decide to do it, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Yes.
We just want you to think about it.
Yes, honey, maybe you can talk to someone who has had a baby. Like your mother?
My mother never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.

Umm, thanks for meeting me.
Thank you. All right.
Come and sit down.
Sit.
Sit!
Umm, omnipotent, before I start, I just need you to declare for the official record that you're actually Frank Buffay.

You're lucky ....
Everyone, this is Paul. Paul, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Hello!
And Joey ....
Hello!
And Ross.
Hello!
He does not speak much English.
Look that!
So, um ... where does Paul come from?
Oh ... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. In our lives
Well, the cat ... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
This is fun ... .... and Rachel keeps touching it.
Alright. I looked all over the building and did not find the cat anywhere.
Oh, I found it. It was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! Here it is! Last to know it again! And I'm guessing ... since nobody told me ... this is Paul.
Ah, Paul, this is Phoebe.
I bet!

Ok, where the hell did you get it ?!
When mom and dad took you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam in the lake and fished out.
That cup is mine!
No it is not! You want it, you have to win it!
All right, so we're not having dinner at all?
Why?
Because I do not work at the Szechwan Dragon.
All right.
You really need to sleep a little, honey.
I know I do it.
Hello.
Hello.
Guess what?
What?
They published my article.
Oh, really, show me, show me.
Rach, look! Oh hello! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker who comes to save me. There he is.

My God.
You know what it is, this is that we are getting ready for the dance.
Oh.
What?! You got us evicted !!
I told you not to go over there!
Well, he made Rachel cry!
Rachel always cries!
It's not true!
Now Joey, go over there and suck it alone. I mean you suck like you've never done before!
All right! I'll try! But if I can not, you can stay with Chandler and I until you settle down.
Leave!!
All right, all right, all right.
I mean, I'll have to check it first, but I'll think it will agree.

So, he's just a good guy. Do you really think that this Mark wants nothing in return for helping him?
Well, I suppose I'll have to take a shower with him, but you know, it's true for any job.
How do you feel?
Well, my apartment is gone, because I drank it.
Where did you get too? We lost you after opening all the presents.
Yes.
Yes, I ended up in the warehouse and not alone.
Woooo hoooo !!!
Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
Why, what happened?
Ah, I was fooled with Joey's sister. Well, this is not the worst part.
What's the worst part?
I can not remember which sister.
See what men do! Do not tell me men are not cute! This is a man !!

What's wrong with you?
Anything!
Well, I had this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights first, then I fainted and since then I have not been able to stand up.
But um, I do not think it's serious.
It looks like a hernia. Devi-tu-tu-Go to the doctor!
There's no way!
'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it will be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Why do I have to start working again?
Damn you 15s!
And a little '
It has all these levels.
First there is a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then a custard, which I made from scratch.
[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, other ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something wrong]
then a little more custard, and then the bananas, and then I just added some whipped cream!
It tastes like feet!
I like it.
Are you kidding?

Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks you're a fox.
Welcome everyone, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Oh, oh! It's on again!
Guys, we can please do not look all right.
Shhhh!
People, it's never happened to you.
Go to the fridge to get a nice glass of milk, and these damn boxes are so floating that you can not open them.
Oh, you said Mike. Aw! There must be a better way!
And there's Kevin.
Can we please disable it?
Noo, Kevin.
There's a revolutionary new product that guarantees you'll never have to open the milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Are you curious?
You're flingin'-flangin 'true I'm!
Keep in mind that you've never used this product before, you'll see how easy it is to do it.
Go ahead.
It works with any milk carton.
Wow, it's easy. Now I can have milk every day.

Well, you could tell him that his wife seems to be gay.
She's not she's gay. My God. She is
Good day for married people eh?
I'm sorry your husband betrayed you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women are not great too.
Try telling my wife.

Hey, Ross, will you hand me that knife?
I can not wait to be with you!
I'll be secretly as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
I'll just tell Rachel that I'll do the laundry for a couple of hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is this my new nickname?
Awww, you know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
Arghh !!

I can not believe I'm losing this job!
Oh I'm so sorry! Is there anything I can do?
Yes! Help me get this mini-fridge over the security guard.
Hey, Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yes?
Well, I do not want to talk to you Wayne!
I hate you!
You ruined my life!
Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
Wayne, Chandler.
Hello how are you?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I will take you back to your job if you help me.
Why should I help you?
The reason he just said.
What do you need?
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, do you know Sarah?
What?
And I'm just a love machine too.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.

Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. It's just the sweetest little man!
See you, Phoebe! Oh, hey, thank you for sneaking in!
Did you splinter inside ?!
Yes, uh-huh, 100 dollars.
Phoebe! I can not believe you gave them money! I thought I agreed that it was absolutely unreasonable to ask me for that money!
Yes, but they did not ask me!
You know?
In this way it is only you, the exotic and generous foreigner.
It's always fun to be.
Yes, but you're making me look bad!
No I'm not.
No!
If ever I'm making you look better!
They will see you talking to me and this is ... I am a success!
Oh hey, Phoebe!
Hey!
Oh hey, Ross.
Umm, you see, I was thinking that maybe you two could change apartments because Phoebe is more our kind of people.
Something to think about.
Yes, okay, my bad.

All right, all right, all right ...
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?
Whaddya thinks? Today is the big day!
My God. Ok, go to the bathroom, use whatever you want, but never tell me what you did there.
Thank you!
Where's Joey? His mother is on the phone.
He is in the bathroom. I do not think you want to go in there!
Come on, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...
Who is noisy?
Oh, that would be Monica.
Hey, listen, I want to borrow a couple of things, Aurora has spent the night, I really want to have breakfast.
Oh, you've got all night, eh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes to Ethan, so, you know ...
Ooh, do I feel a little resentful?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.
'Kay?
You know, in a relationship, do you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
Well, every single second is like that with Aurora ... and I just lost about thirty-five of them talking to you, so ... Monica, can you help me with the door?
Sure.
Oh, um, Chandler?
You know, the ... old Monica would ... would remind you to rub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush ... But I will not.

Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Hey, Joey! Aww, you remembered even if you're a big star!
Aw, let's go! It will take years before you forget!
Joey, how's it on a movie set, eh?
Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, well yes, yes, I have all this going on.
Yes, listen, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he could not have been more wrong!
Uh Oh!
I have to go Monica, eh, my sushi is here!
I'm sorry for that Thanks for waiting.
Everyone is smiling! OK thank you very much! Enjoy your stay in

Wow, it's great, guys. The whole city is dark!
Mum says it's all over Manhattan, part of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it will come back.
Wow, guys, this is great.
Pants and a sweater?
Why, mom?
Who will I meet in a blackout?
Guys from the electric company?
Suitable Looters?
Could we talk about it later?
OK.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check my grandma. What is my number?
Well, I'll never call

What are you doing?
Take a swim
What about the girl?
The chicks do not swim.
Are you sure?
I do not know. Should we try it?
Sure.
See, I told you they do not swim.
Wait. Give it a minute.
Noo! Oh, everything's fine, everything's fine, baby, baby, baby.

I'm taking care of you, eh?
You guys feel safe.
Right?
Ok, I'll take that bubble spit like, "Yes, I do!"
Ok, after getting rid of this dirty Leslie diaper, I'll fix you with a clean one.
Ok I'm sorry.
I did not mean to scare you.
I just have to clean it up.
All right?
Because let's face it, we're from Monica.
I broke it.
All right.
Well, this is just the way it goes.
Good ok.
Why are there only two of you?
Where is Leslie?
Well, you can not answer.
Leslie?
Where are you Leslie?
Leslie, now it would be a

Hey!
Hey.
Hey, why are you washing your ceiling?
Oh, there's banana on it.
You said it was bald.
Yes, it was bald, it is not now.
How could you not tell me that he has hair?
I do not know, I almost never say it about people.
Ohh, well, this is simply perfect!
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you said it was fine.
Yes, I said what was good when I thought it was a strange bald girl. I mean, you know, that girl has hair
Well, maybe it will not work. Maybe Ross will not like his personality.
Why, does he have a bad personality?
Oh no, Bonnie is the best!

Hey!
Hey.
Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I am, I'm really uncomfortable talking.
Sure. What? About you, are you taking a shower with your mother?
Actually I had an argument in mind! I am, I am going through a period of drought, wise sex.
Whoa, for how many months?
Excellent! Excellent! And finally, you're in some strange stuff, you know, sexually?
No!
Oooh, wrong answer.

Ouch! My ass is fine. All right. Oh, shhh!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I did not want to make any noise!
So do not break up !!
Oh yes, Smokey Joe here came halfway to the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old child.
So why are you smoking?
Well, it's very upsetting.

Honey, I was wondering ....
Hmm?
Do you still have that one, um, Navy uniform?
Nooo, I had to return it instead of the costume.
Hmm.
I think I have an old high school band uniform.
Remember you did not have sex in high school, right?
Yes.
Well honey, and you?
What?
I mean, you're having fun, you know, things like fantasy?
No.
Come on, you must have one!
Ugh!
I do not know Monica.
It's fun to be here.
I mean, if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, it's like cheating on Chandler.
Not at these prices.
Hello. You know, in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Court!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You must hear this bad boy.
Eh, Monica, it seems so strange, you know, Chandler is your friend ... Oh!
My God!
Oh, all right, take this bed, you can make other friends.

You know, ever since I was a child, I've been able to gain fourths with my toes.
Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my photos. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
All right.
Oh, are you sure?
Really?
Because you know, you could make small puppets and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
We can not do it.
What? What can not you do?
Did he really say that?
Well, I added the "exactly like me" part ...
But she said she's looking for someone, and someone will be there tonight.
'Tonight tonight?
Well, I think it's perfect
You know, it's just the two of us, he spent the whole day taking care of my monkey ...
I can not remember the last time I had a girl taking care of my monkey.
In any case, I thought that after work I would go and get a bottle of wine, go over there and try to court her.
Hey, you know what you should do? You should bring it back in 1890, when that phrase was used for the last time.

The car is waiting downstairs, I just wanted to leave these copies of my book for your friends. Something you want from Lisbon?
No, just knowing that you'll be there will be enough.
Well, well, be good, I love you.
You kissed my best Ross! ... Or something like that.
All right. Look, it was stupid.
Truly stupid.
Truly stupid.
And I do not even know how it happened.
I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.
Are we okay now?
Yes. No. No ...
Ah, forbidden love of a man and his door.
Shh. He did it. He told her no, not just about the kiss, about everything.
Are you kidding.
No, no. He said, "When will you grow up and start being a mom?"

Oh here it is.
They're not your normal dry cleaners.
I know, but that creep I went to on that date goes there, so I have to find a new one.
I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
What?!
A new grocery store.
The universe said I would meet a good guy and that's what they gave me?
When I'm up there, I'll kick my ass.
Do not worry, Phoebe, you'll meet someone. If I can meet a good boy, you can do it too.
Yes, we can both. And we will do both.
Oh, you did not have to come with me.
Are you kidding? This is where spots come out! All right? This is how
All right.
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped Wow!
What?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
Oh yes, I'm sorry for that too, but what are you going to do?
I hope you do not think I'm crazy, but I feel like I want to pick it up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
A bit. Now you're talking.
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
I-I-I would like it. Just let me tell my friend.
Ooh, an inkblot! Hey, can I see how you get it?
She must have left.

Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We are in the same team!
Four hours? Did you guys do it for four hours?
It's right, honey.
All right, let me in
Ninth! Do not do it! Do not do it!
What?
It's a dropper!
Oh yes, it's true!
I'm not a dropper!
It's really a three-person game, you know?
He is launching and taking!
All right.
Oh! Oh! It's so difficult.
Whoa-whoa guys, it's not a cat!
Oh my God, oh my God!
I give up guys, I do not know what I will do with this thing!
Cooking it did not help, eh?
All right, well, the place was closed. I will copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why do not you move to me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no It's okay, I mean I-look at Rach, I know I've scared you with the whole naked Thursday thing, but we do not have to do it!
Well, it would be easier to move right across the corridor. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
Thursday is clearly not good for you, choose one day!

So they are two boxes of Macaron Holiday. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Admit it, Chandler, you do not have the reverse.
Excuse me small, I have a very solid backhand.
Shield your face and scream like a girl ... it's not a backhand.
I was screaming ... like a marine.
All right here. Look at me while I play the three Ps of the championship game. Power. Precision. and penache.

It is not very a phone person.
So, uh, so, what's the problem with this father, I mean, if someone had been my son somewhere, I wanted to know, you know?
Hey, Knick fan, are you interested in your opinions about fatherhood? Uh, no.
Okay, look, maybe I should go.
Maybe you should.
Good luck, and uh, be careful, eh?
Do you know what the Celtics problem is? Let the players manage the team.
Oh, it's not true.
Oh, it is.
It is not.
IS.
It is not!

Okay sir, this ends today's lesson, and let's remember, we're safe out there.
It's a great class.
Thank you.
Yes, yes, I was watching.
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
Umm, about that last move where the woman tripped you and then nailed you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Well, she took her keys and tries to block them
No. No-no. No. What it would be
Who? Me the attacker?
I'm sorry Chandler, you know you're so sweet and I do not want to hurt you.
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
No-no-Really ?!
Obviously!
Well, it hurts so much. I
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Well, maybe there's something you can do.
What?! Nothing! Nothing!
Well, I umm, I mean it's just at the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.
This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but would it be possible for him to audition for your movie to say Thursday?
Absolutely! But you, would you really feel better with me than I refuse if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. See you later.

OK! I got it. I will flee over there. I will come back here. OK let's go
Hey guys. Listen, I'm sorry to have played the game before - Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
They are all Chandler.
Chandler sucks! He could not get this good!
I did it. But it came at a price.
But Ben arrives tonight and he can not see him.
Oh come on, at the age of seven children have already seen orgies. Was it just me?

Sure!
Ok, I was thinking we should have a nice guest room, right?
With a mahogany boat bed and bedside tables with flowers all the time!
And we could have a desk with comment papers on them so people could say how much they loved staying here !!
Ok, anyway, I did not think about it a lot.
Well, I like the idea.
Obviously!
I was thinking that maybe-maybe-it could be a game room, you know?
I mean, you can buy old arcade games like ...
No.
Ok, so you do not mean as in "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea, let's discuss it before you completely reject it".
Oh sorry. Of course I say it. An interesting idea, umm, we'll talk about it, but no.
So, is it so?
I do not think the arcade games go to the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room will be full of antiques.
And that is why
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I have nothing against the beautiful guest room, especially since everyone we know lives about 30 seconds away!
You are making a fool of me?
No, I'm not kidding you, or you're a nice guest room.

You know, I love doing crosswords with you, honey!
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
All right! There is only one word left, three letters, not dog but
Cat.
Yup! You're so smart! I love you.
I love you too.

I never sucked, I did not really want you to know how good I was!
Why?
I do not know.
Is fantastic! Now we can enter the doubles tournaments!
That is

Hey!
Hey. Ok, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
But
No! Ninth! It is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended it to me. He said: "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
All right. Ok, but you can not fire him today.
Why not?!
Because I'm downloading it today.
What?! You said it was sweet!
he
Just do not take your phone.
Then it arrives! "I'm so worried about you." UCK! Be a man!
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
You can not fire it and download it the same day, it will kill you.
Okay then, I'll dismiss him today and you go out with him for another week.
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I will kill
Ok, so we'll do both today and he'll just have to deal with it!
All right. But the question is who will go first. Because who goes second is the bitch.
Really? This is the thing I'm worse off! You will see.

This is the last boarding for the 664 flight to Yemen.
Well, I think I have to go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I will wait for you. Do you know at least how long you've left?
Well, only until we find a source of energy to replace the fuel.
Oh. Well, I'll fix you every day. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Ok, goodbye. Goodbye.
Chandler?
No!
Chandler!
Janice!
Here you are!
Here you are!
I had to take a last kiss and you said that you would leave immediately after getting on the plane!
No! No! I want to see you take off.
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we arrive in Yemen, can I stay with you?

Hello!
Hey.
Hey, how's Hilda? Is working?
Ohh, my new assistant is working, yes.
Was he happy that I had given her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy to have hired my new assistant.
Hello?
Oh hey!
Can you, can you wait a second?
They are the producers of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
can you excuse me for a minute?
Hey, funny you should call.
I was just looking at the script for next week.
Canceled?!
As if they were removing it from the air?
Ohh.
All right, I'll see you on Monday.
We do not even shoot them anymore? !!
All right bye!
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Joey.
Why should they do it? It was a good show, right?

It is so isolated here.
I know. I like it here.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Ops. Sorry.
What's up, honey? Have you seen a mouse?
Ninth! Big bear! Big Bear out! I think I-I-you ... actually, do you want to check?
Honey, we have no bears here.
Then OK. Would you like ... take me?
All right. I will be right back.
All right. What?! What are you doing here?!
What are
I came with Paul!
Yes, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!
Here go honey!
Ahh. Thank you!
Diet Coke
What the hell was that ?!
A lesson on the importance of unagi.
Ohh,
Maybe. Now I'm curious, at what point, during those screaming girls, would you have started?
All right, so we were not
I'm sorry I took such drastic measures to express my opinion, but I ... look, I just want you guys to be safe.

What are you doing?
I'm leaning. This is the point where I support myself.
All right. (Go up and swell the pillows on the sofa.
Brenda bee!
What?
Yup! It flew into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons for fear that they sting you!
I think I know what's going on here.
You do?
Look, I know it must be hard for your wife to be a lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
I understand well. I can

All right, let's do it!
No, no, no. What was that?
I know, it was the best I could get from them.
Well, people!
People, people, people.
Let's try again, and this time let's all look at Joey.
Show how it works.
Contact them.

So what did you decide? Your uncle Nathan receives an invitation or not?
Oh, God, nobody likes it, and it's so cheap, it would never fly to London in a million years.
Yes, I invite you?
Hey, did I do it well enough?
Yes, they're fine.
Yes?
If someone asks you, we'll just say that Ben has sent them. Oh! So you invited Rachel back then?
Sure. Why not?
Really?
Yes?
I do not think I would feel comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Wait-wait-wait, believe, maybe we should not invite her?
Oh, no-no, you know I absolutely love Rachel, it's just that, well, it could be an embarrassment for you.
But it is absolutely your decision.
More tea?
Yes sure.
Gray count?
Eh? Yes, well, invite anyone you want.

Hello.
Hey!
Hey! So, how was the doctor?
Oh, everything went great
Good.
Oh hey, show them the image of your womb.
Oh.
I do not see the child. Where is it?
Oh no, I know I did not see it at first, but it's right, Ross, I lost it again.
Oh. (Takes the photo and hugs her.

I'm sorry?
Can you help me with something?
The patient I am looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
Er, it's like the early 30s, very attractive.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Oh yay! Great! Ok, in what room number is it?
I'm sorry, this information is limited to hospital staff
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Dr. Drake who?
Remoray. He is Portuguese. We need that information; I am a doctor.
A doctor in this hospital?
Damn it, we're wasting precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
Hands.
Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me in which room my assistant was staying.
He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
It is in room 816.
816, thank you!
Thank you.
And what's his name?
No!

Hello!
Hello!
Rachel was just helping me. My head was burned by the sun.
Awww.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Ok, see you in our room.
Yes.
My God.
I know.
Ok, i have to go.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Well, I have to go break up with Bonnie.
Here?! Now?!
Good yes.
I can not ... I can not stay here all night, and if I go, she ... would like to ... do things.
What happened?
He will not make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Oh, friend! Chicago, it's so lucky!
Stupid, useless Canadian money!

Rachel, one of your clients seems to have left his wallet. A Joshua Bergen.
Really?
Will you call him?
Yup!
I will do it!
Absolutely!
(He takes his driver's license and license and keeps them standing face-to-face.
Then proceed to act as Dark Helmut in

My God! It's so beautiful!
I'm full, and yet I know if I'll stop eating it, I'll regret it.
Hey!
Hey!
What do you have there?
Oh, umm, it's a tofu cake. Do you want some?
What are you doing tonight?
Eh? uh
Guy! Guy!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I have these plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had an appointment at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
This is what Monica said.
After he gave me that important speech ?!
Do you go and make an appointment with a guy the same night he's scheduled with me?
I think he's trying to make it fast on Big Daddy!

OK, is this lamp in the same place?
Who cares? I reject women.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no !!! You can not come here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
What?!
It's yours!
Yeah, well, I'm a whore.
Me too.
Hi Jill!
Hey!
Hello .
Rachele.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not home, you're six-you're right here.
Yes, I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it is not!
All right. So well, umm, I'll have her come home by midnight.

That part was perfect for me! I can not believe I did not understand it!
I'm sorry, buddy.
Hey, you know what you should do?
You should make something happen for you.
You know, how to write a drama.
Write a movie!
Eh?
I mean, what about those
Come on Ross, be realistic, you know? If I had written something, what are the chances I could have for those guys?
Wait a second, I could stay in it!
Or that.
I can not write!
You know, I mean, I_I_I'm an actor, I do not have the discipline that you take, you know?
I can not do that
I will help you.
Yes, I will prepare a program and make sure you commit yourself.
Plus, it will give me something to do.

Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do you do?
Oh, above all fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope it's beautiful.
Yes, it's beautiful. Because I have models here, you know ...... never.
Oh yes, during the summer, I spend most of the weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use.
Although, I should probably tell you, it's a porn star.
Well, listen, I still have one more person to meet, but unless you reveal your sister, I think you have a good chance.
All right.

As bad as it was, I really enjoyed it. I think I will apologize for all the stupid things I do.
Why do not you stop doing stupid things? So you should not apologize.
I would really like it if I could do both.
All right, I have to ask.
What?
Will you break me if you get fat again?
What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could he earn?
One hundred forty-five pounds.
Yes yes it is. It's uh every time on the lips! Why?! Why on the lips?
Here is Frannie. Hmm, will not you be happy to see me?
Now wait a minute, be nice! All right? I did not bring you here so you can take an ambush.
Frannie was the one who found yours
That bitch!
Monica! What
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like it?!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Invite my brother, invite all my family, and not me?
Why?!
What, why would not you want me at your wedding?
What could I possibly do?
Stuart!
I believe you know my husband.
So it's really a question of

Hey sir! What are you here for?
Hey, Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yes?
It's a crime that you and I do not spend more time together.
What happens?
Well, I heard you were thinking of asking Phoebe to move you and I thought maybe we should talk.
Friend, me.
Sure. All right.
Uh, are you crazy? You are crazy? If you live with Phoebe, you two will know, live-live together!
Yes, I ... I considered it. I only know that it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.
Hey! Oh listen, I was just freeing up space for your stuff.
Oh thank you, but listen, I was from Monica and she and Chandler had a fight and they are not moving.
What do you mean, are not they moving? Are they still moving in the right?
No-no, they just had a big bang on what to do with my room.
What?! Beyond a stupid room!
Yes, I feel a bit 'bad for them, but I'm also very sensual because I do not have to move here!
Oh no, yes no, that part is great!

Yup
Shut-out !!
Where are you guys going? Come on, still a game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yes, leave!
You guys are always around in my apartment!
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, eh?
Come on, wussies!
All right, ok, I have to go.
I go, and I leave.
Another match?
Oh yeah!

I'm sorry.
Ohhh. Do not go
No, I_I_I have to go.
No. No! No! No!
Honey, honey, people are watching.
I do not care! I do not care !!
Yes, um, I am, I'm leaving now.
You can not leave! I have your shoe!
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those in plain clothes.

Oh, ew!
What?
Yes, I know what I wanted to ask you.
Um, can you roll your tongue?
Because I can, and my mother could not, and I thought you knew, I thought it was something I received from our father.
What, wait, you mean like this?
Yes, yes. You can do it a.
You're not doing it.
Oh, ok, yes, my mother could, and I can not. We do not have this ....
Where there is no fear of engaging.
We have ... Do we have any ideas here?
Well, I never went through the tunnel alone, because, as I understand it, you're not allowed to bring more than one girl into the car, right.
But, it seems to me that it's practically like anything else, you know, face your fear.
He's afraid of heights, go to the top of the building!
If you're scared of bugs ... take a bug.
Right.
In this case, you're afraid of committing yourself, so I'll tell you that you go there and be the busiest guy who ever existed.
Surprisingly, this makes sense.
You think?
Oh yeah. Go get it, skip the high dive, fix the gun barrel, pee in the wind!
Yes, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring at the barrel of a gun, I'm practically peeing anyway.

Hey! Hey!
Hello!
Hello! Look! I got our photos developed by the Rockefeller Center.
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to see pictures of me and Mona's ice skating?
Oh, I usually love it too, but I'm just submerged now.
Hey, where are the pictures that the creepy pretzel salesman got us together?
Oh yes, probably at the end. My God! He just took pictures of my breasts!
I miss the photo?!
You know he has a face Ross!
All right. Ok, here's one of us.
Wow!
This is good!
Wow, it looks like a business card, you know, with the tree in the middle, the skaters and the snow.
You know, every year I say I'll send greeting cards and I never do.
Do you want to send it together?
Together? Similar to people?
Yes, you know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It will be nice, ok?
All right.
Oh, I have to go to work. So call me later?
Uh sure, of course.
Hi guys.

I mean, I do not even feel like having a girlfriend anymore.
Do you want me to leave my job to feel like you have a girlfriend?
Is it about Mark?
My God.
Ok, it's not, it's not.
My God. I can not keep having the same fight with you, Ross! Listen, maybe we should take a break.
Well, you're right.
Let's take a break, let's take a break, okay, let's get some frozen yogurt, or something like that ..
No. A break from us.

Bing! We are ready for tonight, at 8 o'clock.
Oh uh, apparently, we can not do it. Monica must work.
Oh, my ex-wife did not work unless you call yourself into her mother's work. Beautiful. Tomorrow evening, then.
Oh, well, tomorrow's not good for her either.
Oh? Why not?
They are the semi-finals of his ball tournament rejected.
What's happening to Bing? Um, does your wife have a problem with me or something?
Well, now you're just talking crazy.
So why can not we all go out together?
Because we-we have left each other. Monica and I broke up. Hold me.
Good Lord Bing, I can not say I'm completely surprised, I saw the way he looked at you and there was no love there.
And the way he looked at me, pure lust.
You know, what would really help me in this difficult moment is suffocating something. Can I suffocate you?
Bing, my boy, we will get you through this.
Now here's the plan, get your coat, let's go to a strip club.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would drive you crazy. But to hell with that bitch.

Look at you, sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel ... with Emma's little chubby hands wrapped around you.
It's all right, Emma, ​​you're sleeping.
: Move away from the cradle, I have a weapon!
It's all right, everything's fine, Rach, it's me. Put the piercing down.
What are you doing?
Well, I heard Emma waving, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Oh, thank you. Well, now that I'm awake, I'm going to the bathroom.
Here's sweet ... It's not over.

Called?
No sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he would call. Why did not he call?
Perhaps it is intimated by women who are really intelligent, strong and successful.
Sophie, please get out of my ass. Why did not he call, Rachel? Why?
Ok ok. Umm, well, maybe he, maybe he feels embarrassed because you're my boss.
Awkward? Why should you feel uncomfortable?
Well...
The only person who should feel uncomfortable is you, and you did not tell him not to call me, right?
No me ...
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend who attends someone you work for, there are always ways to solve ... that.

And are you angry because you did not make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I ask is just a little emotion!
Is it too much to ask after six years ?!
I mean what?
I'm-am-am Rachel and I'm not as close as you guys are!
I mean, do not we have a lot of fun ?!
Do not I deserve some tears? !!
I mean, we-we told Joey, he cried out loud!
Hey!
I did not cry!
Come on!
It's like the end of an era!
No more J-man and Channie's!
!
Ok, I have to ask, who's calling us ?!

Do I know why we are running?
Yes, do you know the ah, the girl I told you about last night?
Well, it turns out that ah, he wants to get back together with me.
Oh, I found it!
!
It's great for you guys!
Yes!
Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Oh thanks. Hey, hey. Rachel !!!!
Hello. Ohhh, you received my message.
Yes, oh hey, you're right in time.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, you can, a lot.
Ahhhh !!

Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that I may have lost the table!
Do
ah,
Do
ah,
DO?
You know, I do not understand why they did not cry. It was a nice speech.
Oh come on.
Hey!
Everything you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we learned a lot from mom and dad!
And that picture of Chi-Chi with his mischievous grin.
And what you said about Nana.
Ohh, yes, she really wanted to be there.
And you know what?
I think it was.
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?

You forgot how many great songs Heart had.
Yes.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So, you heard, you repeated it, so this must mean you wrote it.
Oh, guys, with this joke. I have to say that I know I broke, but I'm not even sure I understood it.
What, did not you understand? The doctor is a monkey.
And the monkeys can not write the prescriptions.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think "the Hef" would not agree, which is why he sent me a check for a hundred dollars a-ha.

I can not find the trash bags!
Oh, I think I saw a little here.
What is that?!
I do not know! But maybe if we keep that drawer closed, it will die.
I can not believe we are living here!

Have you still told Rachel that you were not really proposing?
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she pulled her breasts out.
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And how was it ?!
I did not watch it. The head of a stupid child was blocking most of it.
Go and tell Rachel now, before Ross finds out.
Look, it's not that easy. He said he wanted to marry me. I do not want to hurt her.
Ok, look, do it gently.
You are right.
You are right.
I - I'm going to tell him now, before Ross finds out and I'll be nice.
I can do it.
I'm a kind person.
Oh, by the way.
Two people who get in there if you want to check it out.

Hi, Phoebe?
Ok, so I just talked to the nurse and why your doctor is late and why, he will not come.
What?!
Okay, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on these really creepy mores in England.
Which
How would you describe the theme of this book, see here, Rachel Green?
Umm, well, I should say it's one, it's a tragic love story.
Well, it's a fact, but yes. Anybody else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, uh, the wildness of the costumes, which
Excellent! What Rachel astutely observed here
You completely stole my answer!
Well, honey, it was pretty obvious.
Well, how would you know ?! You have not even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
I think yours is a question with many answers.
Would you like to venture?
wanted
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Are you just repeating what?
All right, let's move on.
Alright then.

All right, all right, this is great, Chandler, you put yourself behind the desk.
And ... and when she arrives hopefully, she will not recognize you because, well, why should she?
Uh, okay, and then you make the buzz Ross and me
You are Mr. Gonzalez, and I will be, Mr. Wong.
Different.
Someone asked for security?
You are beautiful.
Okay, which one of you is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Where's my ring? My grandmother's faith dead? Where is it? Where is it?
Way to be cool, friend.
What are you talking about?
There was a ring, in a box, on my bedside table, after you left, it was gone!
Wait, do you think he stole a ring?
We know you got it like that, just to save time and confess!
Ok, who are you?
The Hardy guys?
Look, I do not need to steal a stupid ring, okay?
I earn $ 1,600 a week doing what I do; does any of you guys do it?
Marry me.

My God! Joey!
Hell yeah! I will marry you!
You can not marry him!
Hey, madam, your day is over! It's my turn!
Phoebe!
Why?! Why can not you marry me ?!
I can and I will!
She is not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel is that pregnant.
My God.
Hey!
Phoebe, I think he would notice if you did not have a baby in nine months!
It's Joey!
Now I can not believe it! What? Is Rachel pregnant? Who is the father?
We do not know
Ohh I wonder if that guy.
Is there a guy?
Yes.
Who? Who is it?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I did not see who he was but
The story was over?
The boy left this.
My God! I know who the father is
People have to finish their stories!

Oh my God, you're back!
Ohh, show me! Show me your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I want to see what's in your hand. I want to see the trash.
Yes.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw it away.
No!
Me too!
Hey, when the music starts again, I was thinking of getting into the robot, you know?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we do not want to look stupid!
Well, we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Three two one!
Cut!
No! Year! Happy New Year!
Ok, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice job to everyone that's a conclusion!

So Lizzie, are there-are you going to stay the night?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Good. Good. It's not that we do not want you to stay, of course you're welcome. How many tasks do you still have?
I see. You know, Phoebe makes bunny socks.
No!
No, she is not.
Uh Phoebe, what he does ... those are the rabbits with the socks.
They are completely different - OK!
All right!
All right!
I did not do it!
I'm sorry!
I completely forgot about tonight and the fact that we should
Oh alright. I do not
No-no, it's not good!
It is not!
I mean, you were just so amazing!
You spent all this time and this effort to make this tape for me!
You know, I'll do it ... I'll see you!
I will do it!
I-I go
Well, I thought a lot about the tape.

No. And then I called him, and he was not there.
Well, then he is, probably alone, out.
Oh, thank you very much, I'm glad you came.
Hello.
Hello! It's me.
Hello! Oh, I'm so happy you called.
Really? I thought, this is crazy, I mean do not do it, do not you think we can work on this?
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Who is that?
Nobody.
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Is it Mark?
Umm, honey, look, it's just arrived ...
Yes! Done!
Hey, dinosaur boy, look at you, so sad. Come Dance.
Ah, all right, thanks.
Hey, you do not have to smile. You just have to dance.
Look, I do not feel like dancing, I want to drink something. All right?
Oh ok. Hey, two beers.

Do you want to go to the bedroom? It's a bit more comfortable.
Sure.
All right. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of ​​talking sexy?
Seriously, do you know the contracts I gave you, did you notice them at night?
Which contracts?
Okay, please tell me this is just one of your jokes that you do that I do not understand.
What kind of thing?
You know, like when you put your phone in your pants?
Label!
I'm serious!
This is not fun!
Those contracts absolutely had to come out today!
Rachel, I'm sorry, but you did not give me any contracts!
Yes i did it! And I put a little
I'm telling you, you never gave it to me.
You know what Tag, if we went to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I would see you embarrassed because I am
Or maybe you would see me embarrassed because you're talking on the phone with your horse!
Do you want to go to the office right now?
No! Come on late, we will not go to the office.
Ok I understand. I would not even be denied.
Ok, take your coat! Oh! When did you do this? Good job!

Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
Nice to meet you.
Oh and I need to talk to you.
About what?
To see if you know what these guys are talking about.

Phoebe, how are you?
I'm fine. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking fast?
No, it seems like me. Phoebe, it's going great. Look at Chandler with the little girl Chandler.
Little Chandler girl, where did I hear it before?
Oh right, coach Ruben.
Do you know what Phoebe is?
When you're over there, we have a situation here too.
Na-uh, no, we're all responsible for our children.
See that's where I think you're wrong. We have played these children, man by man; we really should play a zone defense.
What do you mean?
Forgive me? You did not keep my calls in a week!
Well, I'm completely over Chandler. Friends forever! Do not come here!
Uh, what was it?
uh,

... I am, I'm fine.
Sounds good. I'll call you - or call me, whatever ...
All right.
Hello.
Whoo-hoo!
Yes, here you are!
Second appointment!
...I do not know.
you
Well, it looks very pretty and all, but all that story of her coming up here, just to see if I was okay?
I mean ... how much is needy?

Do you remember when you where a child and your mom release you to the cinema with a jar of jam and a teaspoon?
You are so cute.
Hello!
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, oh, do you know that guy who followed me? I spoke with him today.
Did you talk to him. You are crazy?

Thank you, happy holidays.
Now that's trash. Miss, you can not Hey! Stop that young woman, donated the trash!
Hey !!
The charity is on fire!
Help!
Oh good!
Thanks, I need it.
Whoa!
What is that?!
It's nine o'clock in the morning!

Can I help you?
Uh yes, where ... where is the guy who decides what are the pictures on the wall?
He is not here now.
Oh, you're kidding me!
All right, make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani has stopped leaving all these clothes.
All right?
I am an actor; I'm taking my picture up there on the wall.
You know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for a drink? Are you the other one right?

Yes, and it really scared me! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and this just pushed you.
What?! You are crazy! There is nothing sexual in the noises I make!
Really?
Is there nothing sexual about this?
Oooh.
Hate!
Ohh.
Ohhhh.
Ohh.
What are you looking at?!
I mean bye
Oh my-this is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I will never be massaged again!
No, you can not allow this to stop you from getting massages!
No, I have, I have a lot of customers who make the same noises you do!
Really?!
Well, not the customers, the lovers. But let's just know, try again. Go back and we'll work on it.
Are you sure?
Yup.
I presume.
Great! OK, if you just want to excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?

Noo !!!
Yup!
Noo !!
Yup!!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! Let them know.
Ok, here's the thing. We'll have a coffee and they'll never know you're drunk.
Really?! You promised?
Yes, I'll take care of it.
All right. I love you so much.
All right, we have to do something for your breath.
What to say
It's still yours. Ok, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you enter, act surprised.
All right. I can do it.
All right.
Surprise!!!

Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
Yes, we're done.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go and see Imax's new movie on the tide pools?
Really?!
No. But I got tickets for Knicks for you, me and Chandler.
Sweet!
All right, finish your coffee well; Here we go.
Ah, no-no-no, only Ross. Ross and Joey are quite embarrassing.
Uh, really, I'm sorry, I can not do it either. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
I understand: who would cancel an effective date to go to a false bachelor party?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel baby tonight

So it's up to these two, Nancy, I know you like this and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Well, that's nice but uh, me alone, I love this fabric Sorry.
Oh do not be sorry, it's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I'll take credit for them - I'm joking.
He's joking, but he's never in disagreement with her. Ok, I'm joking!
Oh, what a fun office.
I do not know which one, but I know I need a cigarette.
So, what do you say we take a break, let's go outside and find out when we'll be back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my father is a doctor and he always told me horrible stories about ghosts and goblins that totally supported the princess's smoking right.

What?
Fishing pit
Yes, Bunny?
Fishing pit That night we have, uh- we-
-Peaches?
In reality, nectarines, but basically ...
It could have been a fishing.
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I ... I accompanied her to ... the bus stop ... I'm fine.
Hey, that woman has an ass like that of Carol! What? I thought we were trying to find things.

All right!
Westminster Abbey!
Hands down, the best abbey I have ever seen.
Hey!
All right.
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
I think it's great. It's great. You know, they are thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? At what?
Put the car away !!!
Man,
You know, I can not believe I get my nails done! IS
Chandler, there's a guy right there.
That's a postman! That is
Chandler, do not worry! This does not make you less than a guy!
Hey, you know who had nails like that?
Hmm.

Eh ..., I do not, I do not know.
What?
Well, as old as it is in the dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Rachel?
Yes.
Do you remember when you first came here, how did you spend two weeks training another waitress?
Oh sure! Do you need me to train someone new?
Well. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to resume training every time.
Eh, do you believe it?
Yes?

Hey baby, you're the guy with the baby, you said we'd do the kind with the baby.
No, you said the baby is insinuating.
No, the child creeps me.
You said the baby.
Why does the child insinuate me?
Why does the child insinuate you?
Guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
Is this happening in your book?
Yes, it's about relationships. You know? The pitfalls, pitfalls, what not to do, continue to move forward. This stuff is fantastic!
What?! I'm sorry!
And how it does not matter when people really love each other.
And how people will believe everything you say to them as long as it's a compliment.

Yes!!!!
Yes, I did it!
I'm on time!
Okay, because we do not open all our books on page 23.
Where you will see a lot of red spots.
Ok, umm, why not, why do not you start reading everyone while I-

Yes, all right. All right! Keep walking! All right?
Ross! What are you, I'm sorry, sir. Only, I think he really likes it.
Hey! Do you know that teacher who had a child with his student?
Thing? What
Hello!
To lose? Can I help you?
Okay, do not ... do not be angry, okay?
But after unpacking the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you, so I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything and then I forgot where, where he came back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
All right. Chandler, are you scared of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Obviously not.
I mean, Chandler, what you did, is, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
I know I have this strange thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I would never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
Obviously!
Oh well you are the best You come here to me.
All right, do you hold on? Starting from the beginning. Ok, now he's sitting at Ross

All right, that's all. I can not make this decision! IS
A Magic Eight ball?! You can not be serious, you can not make this decision with a toy!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I do not know what else to do.
I mean, or I keep my wife and I lose one of my-my best friends or I hold my friend and divorce the second time before I'm 30!
So, if someone has it, have a better suggestion, listen to it!
Because I ... I have nothing!
All right, do not be shy, any suggestion will.
Alright then.
Here we are.
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
Ask again later.
Later it is not good enough.
Ask again later.
What the hell!
This is broken!
It's-it's broken!
OK let me see. Chandler will have sex tonight? Do not count on it. It seems that it works for me.

I'm sorry.
Yes?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Yes.
I can get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.

I think he took it pretty well. You know that Paul is over there now, so ...
Ah ... ooh! Well, it seems, we kicked your butts.
No-no, he kicked our ass. You could be in the standing Olympic team.
Let's go, two against one.
What are you still doing here? He just broke up with the boy, it's time for you to fall in!
And now?
Yes, now it's when you fall!
You have to make sure that when Paul comes out of there, the first one that sees Rachel is you, he must know that you are all that he is not!
You're like, like the anti-Paul!
My Catholic friend is right.
She is upset.
You're there for her.
Collect the pieces and then introduce Ross's age!

Well, I just called Joshua
Oh, how did it go?
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not a crazy girl who's dying to marry - I'm having a hard time.
What he said?
Well, his answering machine was
Ohh, honey! Hey, I bet you anything will call you again.
Yes, maybe, but I do not even think that interests me.
I do not think he's the one I'm sad about.
You know, I know I said I totally agree with Ross getting married, but apparently, I do not think I'll handle it so well.
Yes, maybe.
And I - I'm just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
Well, yes, you know how we were playing again, again, again, again?
I guess I just realized that somewhere along the way, we would be up again.
Yet. You know what? I think we all did it.
Hey!
I do not understand!
He was in my room all night!
And if she did not take it, and I did not get it; and you did not get it, so who was it?
Shh!
We are trying to think!

This is unity for you, my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some large enough to fit an adult man.
What?!
Oh yeah!
I entered them once.
My roommate bet me five dollars I could not, and then stuck a blackboard between the handles that held me back.
Yes.
It was fun as long as I felt like I was in a coffin.
No, you can not adapt to that thing. It is not deep enough.
Oh yeah? If I can not, I will beat five dollars from the price of the unit.
All right, you made a deal.
All right. To see?! I told you!
Sometimes I get here just to leave! Hey, a nickel !!

Hey! What happens?
Hey!
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey !!
Hey, Joey!
Erin! Still here!
Yes, we ended up spending the day together and we had a great time!
Why should not you? Erin is great! So ... there are guys.
Ohh, listen. I have to go. Today was fantastic, thank you!

I think I reported half a beach in my hair. It was much easier when I shaved my head.
You know, I have to tell you, just
Really?!
Ohh!
Because I think I shave everything right sometimes.
Really?!
Yes!
I mean you should definitely do it.
You know what, I should do it.
Yes!
Yes, thank you, Rachel, you're so strong.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
All right.

Oh, Monica. You're not even going over that thing yet.
This woman is living my life.
What?
She is living my life, and she is doing it better than me!
Look at this, look.
Buy tickets for plays that I want to see.
She, she buys clothes from stores that are intimidated by salespeople.
He spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You are not an artist.
Yes, well I could be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all these things. Only not me.
I can not believe you would really say it. I would rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
There's no way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, it must be, like, the driest snack there is.
I do not know, you do not want to joke with corn nuts. They are crazy.
My God. You guys! You must come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I can not believe! He's looking at us!
Oh, he's so sick.
I feel violated and not in a positive sense.
How can people do it? ... Oh, guys, look! The ugly naked boy has gravity boots!

The man was fantastic! Eh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Yes, it's incredible that it lasted so long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper here.
You know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? All right? I'm

Hey, Rachel, you can pass me on
Yup!
Leave!!
What?!! Stop that! Stop that! My God!
All right! All right! All right! See you between 3 and 4 hours.
Oh!

Hey!
Hey! You've been really great! You've been really, really fantastic!
Oh, thank you, thank you.
So Monica tells me that you do not want to play anymore because I am my talent.
It's true?
Well, a little bit. Yes, yes.
Phoebe
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh all right.
What. Oh no, you just rolled on the juice box.

Hey.
I just saw a woman nursing both her twins at the same time; it's like a weird show here.
What's up?
Anything.
What is that? Hey!
It really is nothing. I am alone
How's it going, what?
I just thought about how my son and I will be all alone.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Oh please, you'll be with her real family, the twins and the new little tits.
Ok, how long have I looked at that woman?
I'm just saying that one day, Ross will meet someone and have a life of his own. Right?
Yes, I think so.
I never thought I would raise this child alone. Pretty stupid eh?
Bob. Bob! Bob !!! What the hell are you doing ?!
I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on, give me a hand!

Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffee at six.
We said seven!
We said you are!
The only way I said you would be if the seven, meet at seven, not six.
Yes, and if I had seven, I might have said something like this, "Wow, my boyfriend is such a wise seven-seven!"
Hello!
Oh my good God
Ugh!
I know what time you said.
What?!
Well, actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
You, get out of my shop!
Well, what did you do?
He came out with my wife!
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did it
That's my wife!!! Go out!
Well, we should go.
Yes.

You know, you really did not have to take me to the airport.
Oh please.
Every moment is precious
You know?
Besides, someone had to ride that other taxi with the rest of the baggage, and your friends do not really seem to care that you're leaving too much.
Well, we're not really that close. Ok, so I guess this is, bye then.
On no! No! It's not goodbye, I will not leave until you get on that plane.
No, I'm afraid I will not be able to make love like him.
Yes, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the true words.
So big, so Joey has a lot of girls, does not mean he's good at bed.
We share a wall! So either she's fantastic in bed, or she just likes to agree with him.
Honey, with you it will be different. Sex will be fantastic, because you - you guys are in love.
Yes?
Yes!
Just go Chandler.
Yes, you should.
Yes, you should, really.
Go ahead.
All right, all right, I'll go to sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm doing it just for you guys.

: I'm sure as a dancer, Marge will never use me.
Come on Treeger, do not say that.
You alone ahh, you only need more practice.
Here, let's go, let's go, let's try again.
Come on.
Besides, it was, probably it was mainly my fault, anyway.
I mean, you know, I'm not so comfortable dancing with a ... We-He !!
Hey!
: Yes!

Oh, me
Are you sure? I bet there is another flight to Minsk
July. Umm,
It's very nice. What does it mean?
Please, clean my glasses. I do not go out much from the lab.
That's good. I have to admit, I thought it was something else.
Yes, I Well, actually I really wanted to say that, but, um, I thought I probably should not because, you know, I have to leave.
You are right! You are right. Do not say that
I-I do though.
I do it too.
Hi Phoebe.
Ok, it's not the moment Joey. All right? You can yell me against tomorrow.
I know.
Oh-oh, wait, did you hear that?
Listen, I'm getting something from your grandmother, you said that since you have to keep the one bedroom apartment, should you give Rachel the purple chair?
No, I do not hear it.

Yes I've heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh, well, it's great!
Yes! Yes!
I can not believe you marry!
Yes.
Monica and Rachel understood.

Ohhh!
Why are we in bed together?
I do not know. Do you have any clothes?
Yes.
Really?!
No!
But we ... we did not have sex ... did it?
I mean, I do not remember much of last night, it was such a blur.
Oh! I remember having laughed! I laughed a lot.
And we did not have sex.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm glad I did not do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.

What we will do?
I say that we go with
Chandler?
Have you already seen us? Did you see us?
Janice, what are you doing here?
What's that smell?
I know!

Hello, remember us?
Um, ok You just called a few minutes ago to need a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need one
I'm. I'm
Yes, and and, I will pay for this with a check.
Yes, I know ... I too am not so bright.

Hey, Monday, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one would you wear?
You know what? it
Sorry.
I'm so excited!
I've been waiting for this for months!
I have colored hair!
I have new sheets!
I'm doing it to
Um-hmm.
By the way, what am I doing?
Well, you're making a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild walnuts, wild rice, roasted asparagus and salmon on the back.
I thought I'd give him a filet mignon?
Yes, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you left it in the restaurant.
And then you realized that if I cursed you, you'd stop cooking and you'd have to prepare your famous baked potato and the Diet Coke.
Wow, I really laugh when I cook.

Chandler! It happens to many guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, do not worry!
I'm not worried, I'm ... I'm fascinated
You know, it's like ... Biology!
Which is funny because in high school I, I ... I failed biology and tonight the biology disappointed me.
Check it out. Ok, I can play when the guests arrive. Okay.
Phoebe!
If you let me finish, he would still say that he's probably not gay.

You are falling deeply asleep.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Now you are completely asleep.
It is not necessary to smoke.
Cigarettes do not control you.
You are a strong and sure woman, who does not need to smoke.
A strong and confident woman.
Thanks for your patience, you're the next caller.
Yup!! Yup!! I'm the next caller! You would have me hanging up.
Hey! Can you bring a duck and a girl to the theater?
Obviously not.
No.
All right. I just wanted them to hear from someone else.

So, how are things going with Paul?
Good.
Even if you know, he's a private boy.
You know, I wish I could open it up a bit, share some feelings.
This is easy! You just have to think of it as a jar of pickles that does not open.
So what are you saying? Should I let him run under warm water and bang his head against a table?
No, this is what you do when you want to get the truth from someone.
Hi sweetie.
Hello!

Okay, Ben, I will not tell your father that you ate an ice cream for dinner, if you did not mention our little incident.
Monica, number one, I do not think Ben understands the concept of corruption, and the number two, I ... What ?!
You said the number two.
I also said the number one.
Remind me to check with you which jar is decaffeinated and which is regular.
Can not I just look at the handles on them?
You'd think.
OK well.
Gunther, you know what, I'm a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible maid?
Because, I do not care.
I do not care
I do not care which dish is regular and which dish is decaffeinated, I do not care where the tray is, I do not care, this is not what I want to do.
So I do not think I should do it anymore.
I'll give you the notice of my weeks.
What?!
Gunther, I stopped.
Does this mean we have to start paying for coffee?

Ohh, I mean, it's so realistic!
I know. Yes, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I see!!
Are you ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably should not ... so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it rains!
Very cute, eh?
But if you're thinking that you can put a fish in there and it would not get sucked into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's right here.
All right. God, you know, if someone had told me a week ago that I'd pee in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
Yes, life is pretty, right?
Yes sure!

You know, I think I'm sixteen.
Please, just a little bit behind.
I'm still in "no".
Uh, morning. Guys, do you think you can close your eyes just for a second?
No-no-no-no-no, I'm not thinking about it yet.
What is happening?
Well, I did a stupid thing last night.
What stupid did you do?
Ewww!

I know.
See, yes.
It's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different girl.
I love you both.
But in very different ways.
Hey!
Hey!
(sees that he is watching
I did it! But the store would not take her back! So I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
If they can not find a home for her, they kill her! And I will not let that happen to little Yasmine!
Ok, well, well, well, because, well, because I had a change of mind too.
All right. And they're not just chicks, you know? They are all kinds of other animals!
It's horrible! Well, you did the right thing, man.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!

So, Chandler, did you hear about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Uhh, yes. She, she, she, she could have mentioned it.
So, Monday, when will we meet this new secret waiter?
Ohh, it's really shy. I-I do not think she's still able to meet everyone.
Yes, I do not think he's still able to meet everyone.
I do not care! I want to meet this guy who is the best sex I've ever had!
Really?! This is what you heard? You said that?
I could have said it. Why is it so funny?
Because I'm very happy for him! IS
Hello!
All right, well, I can not think of it right now. I just want to say goodbye to my grandma.
All right.
All right, let's say goodbye.

Hey!
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and get me out of the apartment?
Honey, if I wanted to do it, I might as well give it a fish, you know how the fish scared me!
Fish!
It would not matter, Phoebe, you and me, we'll live together, we're roommates; this is the deal.
Yes, but I wanted you to live with me, but ok, if you're having so much fun here
Oh, it's a lot more fun with you.
We had fun, right?
We did!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see him tonight.
Oh, I'd like to!
Okay okay!
Good, good, good, good, good.
All right, all right, and Monica asks me to stop the drum.
Um ... Done!

Sei, hey, you're not paying for pizza!
Oh come on, it's right, you paid the flight. Now is it, is it enough Lira?
Ah, I'd throw another thousand on this.
Why, how much is it?
It's about 60 cents.
Ok, it's a coffee.
Cold coffee? Tell me it's a frozen coffee!
It's-it's hot
Hot coffee !!!
Idiot!!
You would have poured some hot coffee over me, eh? !!
What are you just a big idiot, stupid, stupid, idiot, with a stupid idiot hairstyle, eh ?!
Eh?
!
What's your favorite thing about summer?
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light very late.
Yes
Hey!
Tommyyyy! Tell me, what's your favorite thing about summer?
Ooh, I do not know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Oh, that's good.

OK, try this salmon mousse.
Mmmm. Good.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It is more creamy.
Yes, well, that's it
I do not know. We're talking about fried fish, Monica. I'm just glad I kept it hidden, you know?
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests ... and what do I learn?
"You are perfectly suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational company."
Is fantastic! Because you already know how to do it!
You can believe? I mean, it does not seem to me that someone should actually do something
Oh Chandler, I know, I know ... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here, maybe this will cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better share it with you.

I thought it would be a closed casket.
Well, that does not mean it can not look nice!
Honey, do you think you can get in there?
I do not see why not.
Here is my catch!

Someone in there?
No. This is just a part of a devil devil that game called "wait until the last moment before bursting and dying".
Heck, buddy, you fell .. Hello! So, ah, did you really do it?
Someone was in the lady's room, I could not wait. I left the cover for you though.
You know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm talking to ah ,. This is the part where you say your name.
Ginger.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so ....
Do not you have to use the bathroom?
No, no, I'd just like to ah, I'd rather talk to you.
Sure.
Yes, I have to go to the bathroom.
Someone in here

I will continue to go out with my mother, and there is nothing you can do about it!
Oh yes, there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? How did you do with Charles ?!
It was an accident! And so it was you.
Well, at least I'm not a killer!
Oh, my baby!
It was a great scene! E-e-and that slap seems so real! How do you do it?
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I have ice here?
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say that I think you're wonderful.
You're not the dying fan are you?
What?
I should meet and hug a dying fan, but it should not be before!
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I - I'm the guy in a coma!
Oh was that a real person ?!
An-an-any-I-I just wanted to say that since I'm taking your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there were any advice you can give me
I-I-I will leave the show?
I do not know. Why? Did you hear something?
Who told you that?
Oh, one of the writers.
Which? Was he bald or was he tall?
Umm

Feeling better?
Yes!
Much!
Listen, not that I'm insecure about my manhood or anything you know, but I think I need to be with a woman like now.
Yes, I see.
Yes! All right! Hey! Hello!
Hello!
You know, you look familiar. Did we see each other somewhere?
I do not think so
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on
Wow!
Yes.
Really?!
HM-mmm.
$ 4.50 please.
Oh, let me understand this. These are for you.

All right, all right, all right.
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you have not said a word yet.
Oh God, do something.
Just contact, smile!
Here it is!
You're definitely scaring here.
Would you like to call someone?
Yes, around 300 guys went to school with.

All right! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you that those contracts are not on this desk.
Oh
And my sister.
Ok, very nice braces. Anyway, you know what, the
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a

Phoebe, you do not know that you wake up every night, do not know that you find yourself every morning and do not know that you lived with your grandmother for a week.
Ok, well maybe not on those levels.
Hey.
Hey.
I will never find a roommate, ever.
Why, nobody's okay?
Well, let's see, there was the guy with ferrets, it's plural.
The spitter.
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy who loved my name so much felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
So how many do you still have tomorrow?
Two.
This photographer, who looked really boring.
And this actor, of which I'm not sure, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing', he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message'.
Ross, foot on the floor or do not come anymore!
Sure, your dresser is missing, but you notice it.
What?
I have to go. Yes, Carol should be home now, so ...
Umm, how's it going with you guys?
Oh, better, actually. You know, I_I_I think I finally understood why we were having so many problems lately.
Oh really?
Yes, you know how I have you guys, well, he does not really have close friends that are just his, but last week he met this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really understood, and III think they will make a difference

Hey!
Hello!
What-what are-what are these?
Oh, just some pictures I did and hung up. I thought they would cheer up the place. They do not believe?
No-no-no, no!
Well, why?
It's just that.
This is crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and jackets, but you're not in a perfect world, you're in a museum now.
See that scientist in the classes, he and I always played together with the elementary, but now Peter!
Hey, Peter!
It's me Rhonda!
From PS-129!
I shared my puddin 'which you man!
I gave you mine
I think everyone pretends not to hear you.
Anyway, look, I do not know about you, your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a place, I tell you, he
All right, I'm right here. I'll join you later, Joey.
Op, this is saved. Gift shop.

How come coffee comes, 'dear?
Yes, immediately Mr. Kaplan.
I should not drink coffee, it drives me crazy.
I know!
I bet your thinking, 'What's a smart girl who wants to be in fashion, make coffee?' Eh?
Operation.
Eh.
Oh, you got me
Well, do not think you did not notice your potential.
Well, I have a project for you that is much more tied to fashion.
How do you think?
Oh, it sounds fantastic.
Come here sweetheart.
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you very much.
Well, I knew, I was alone, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, er, maybe you'd like to go back together?
No. But thanks.
Aw how on Phoebe do you think about it?
All right. No. But thanks.
Okay, see you Phoebe.
Wow, it was a bit brutal.
Well, let this be a lesson for all of you, all right.
Once you, once you betray me, I become like an ice woman, you know.
Very cold, hard, inflexible, you know nothing,
Yes sure.

Wow.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry too. But, I have to tell you, I'm a little relieved.
Lifted up?
Yeah, well, I had a lot of fun with you ... I can not stand your friends.

She wants
My God! If you say it again,
Well!
Well!
But this break was not all my fault, and she says here, "If you accept full responsibility ..." Full responsibility!
'... I can start trusting you again.
It seems you can do something.
It does ?!
! '
No?
Listen, Ross, you got what you want, you came back with Rachel.
If you bring it here, you would destroy the best thing that happened to you.
Yes I know.
I mean, no, you're right.
Yes, I think I'll let go.
But you, you understand how difficult it is to forget this.
Of course, it's hard to forget!
But this does not mean you have to talk about it!
On that journey, many things happened that we should never talk about.
What the hell happened on that beach ?!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!

I did not think you were gay. I know.
See my friend, my friend, Rachel, wants to be settled.
Ahh, I just came out of a great relationship, I'm not looking for anything serious.
Oh, you know what, it could be fine even if it was just some kind of adventure, it could be okay with Rachel.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, Rachel, what did you bring to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, this is his full name.
Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Oh, wait a second! I did not say I was not free!
Hey, Chandler, why do not we talk about this to tomorrow's Ranger?
Wait, you know
Oh well, um, a little later than me, generally I'm interested in being, but of course!
Perhaps, before the game, we could enjoy a small group of eight years, Basel Hadens.
Well, I do not really know what it is, but

Monica, let's go. Now let's go people, woman in labor.
Hey, Ross, look what I'm going here.
Yes, save it for the taxi, okay.
What are you doing? Let's go to a hospital.
What, so I can not speak well? There may be doctors there.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
All is well all right.
What is that?
For the trip
Yes, like in a taxi ...
Save it.
Ok, hating this.
Monica, let's go now. Come on, baby coming.
I can not believe it, I'll be an aunt. I will have like a nephew.
Beautiful. Come out, let's go.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.
Here we go, here we are.
Rossy, Rossy.

WHAT IS THAT?!
All right, I - I know, you - you - you have a quality.
Yes, absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, well, because I was worried that you guys would be vague about this.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it is Paul who calls from Rome.
My God! Calling from Rome!
So he's calling from Rome. I could do it. I just have to go to Rome.
Monica, your father just played, but can you do it quickly? Talk with Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Hey dad, how are you? Oh God. Ross, I'm Nana.

So, then, how are you, you came to see me yesterday.
Oh yes, um, all right, I need a divorce.
Oh yes, yes, of course. We live in the building near the sidewalk.
You know?
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and everyone, what do you say we get together for a drink?
Oh, sure, they love us there.
Well! Well! Well!

Dateglieli!
No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!
You stole them from me !!
Give them to me!
Do you just want to get one?
Yes, it seems right. We never use them.
Listen, I really need help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak with a British accent? What I do?
Well
Why do not you delete it?
Yes, the accent will fade and people will think you are, you know, that you are adapting to life in America.
Yes, I mean, come Ross, no one will even notice. I mean, they probably are not even listening!
Are not they listening to me?
Of course they are listening to you! Everyone hears you.
Monica, do you really think I should try this thing out of phase?
I think you're fine.

How about Joey ... Pepponi?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a more neutral name.
Joey ... Switzerland?
Besides, you know, I think it should be Joe.
You know, Joey makes me look like me, I do not know, so big.
That I am not
Joe ... Joe ... Joe ... Stalin?
Stalin ... Stalin ... do I know that name? It seems familiar.
Well, do not ring a bell with me ...
Joe Stalin. You know, it's pretty good.
You could try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin. I think you would remember it!
Oh yes! Bye bye Birdie, played by Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the violinist on the roof.

Are you kidding?
Ok, look.
I-I studied evolution.
Remember, evolution?
Monkey in the man?
Besides, I'm a doctor and I've had a monkey.
I'm Doctor Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
You are both idiots.
The joke is not fun, and it's offensive to women, doctors and monkeys!
You should not discuss who gets credit, you should discuss who is blamed for inflicting this horrible joke into the world!
Now let it go!
The joke sucks!
It's your joke.
It is not.

Hi everyone, Rachel was so good today. She did not gossip at all.
I did not!
Even when I discovered umm, all right, let's just say that I discovered something about someone and say that she will keep it.
Hey, Phoebe! Check-check this.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yes, listen so, I thought I was getting better, so, while I was coming home, I stopped by this guitar shop and
You did it?
No.
Give me your hands. Strings. Give me the courage! Choose. Do you want to learn how to play the guitar?
Yup!
So do not touch one !!
Really? Would you have done it for me?
Yes!
Thank you!
Well, we'll start slowly. The only thing you need to do tonight is find the name of your main character.
Done!
And it can not be Joey.
It is not.
Or Joseph.
Oh.

Hello!
Hello! Hey, Pete, you're back! Hey, take a look.
Wow! Skates!
Wow! You're much sturdier than Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how were you traveling?
Well...
Oh, what did you bring me ?!
Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
Oh, these will go to my permanent collection.
do you want a coffee?
Yes, of course, it would be great.
Regular or decaffeinated?
Ah, which is always the closest.
All right.
So ask me what I did today.
So, what did you do today, Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to become the chef.
What?! Oh.

Hello.
Hey.
Where have you been?
To the vet
It will not make you wear one of those big plastic cones, right?
He says that Marcel's stuff is not a phase. Apparently he has reached sexual maturity.
Hey! He beat you.
He says that over time, he will begin to become aggressive and violent.
What does this mean?
I have to let it go.

Aww man! I can not believe I closed myself out again!
Wait for a friend!
My God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
I certainly did it.
But we have not seen each other since. Well, I'm coming to China, guess who's responsible for the excavation.
Julie! Julie, is not it fantastic? I mean, is not it just a kick in the ass, spit on the neck fantastic?

Can I come in?
Uh, yes, if you want it too.
Do
Yes sure?
Me too.
Okay, Rach, before something happens, I just want to establish a couple of basic rules.
This is only for tonight.
I will not do it if it raises the question of "We".
All right?
I just want it to be for what it is!
Um, what ... what is that Ross?
The physical act of love.
What?! You are crazy?
Oh, so you were not trying to lure me now with your nakedness?
Oh God, did you see me ?! Oh!
You were not trying to lure me with your nudity.
Noo !! No! You thought, did you really think I wanted to have sex with you ?!
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Ohh wow! Excuse me, but Ross you took your shoes off!
Well, are you just going out with Ross?
Everything is alright! OK Bye Bye! She ... will kill me.
Yes, the phone was facing the other side. And that goes up there.

Ah Joey.
Joey Tribbiani.
Listen, Joey, I have a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and he can not get out of Long Island.
So, does this mean that the hearing is deactivated?
Listen to Joey, since you have the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
What?!
Aw like on Joey, it's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand, head, head, on, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big break here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz!
They are the hands ah, step-it, step and jazz.
Have a good time.
Hello.

Wow! Fortunately she has a
Oh, I can not believe it! Is my uterus an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Oh, I can not believe my sperm has a low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they seemed to be in a hurry to get seats!
!
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm sorry there were no better news from your test last week, but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Ok.
Above all, even if your chances of conceiving by natural means are not great, you never know!
So, keep on having sex regularly.
Oh, DAMAGE IT!
Do not worry, after a while it will tune.
Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chance of success would be surrogacy or insemination with a sperm donor.
Ok.
Well, you know, monogamy can be a ... a complicated concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Beautiful. Well, all right, now you'll never know.
We are joking. Come on, say it!
Yes! Come on, come on!
Alright. There is a theory, put forward by Richard Leakey-

Hi, is Carol here?
No, it's at a faculty meeting.
Oh, I just came to get my skull. Well, not mine, but ...
Come in.
Thank you. Yes, Carol borrowed it for a lesson, and I have to bring it back to the museum.
Such as?
A bit like a big, skinless face.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can only look for it.
Ok. Wow, you guys definitely have a lot of books on how to do a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they will not let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the child.
The child, who is not yet born? Does not that mean you're ... crazy?
What, do not you think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really ... do you really talk to us?
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up, man?
I'm trppd ... in an ATM vstbl ... wth
My God! He is trapped in an ATM atrium with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yes, as if that thought had never entered my mind.

and this was all before 10 o'clock.
The catering service rang and said it would be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
And then the florist called to say that there are no tulips.
Oh, and the little one has the carpel-tunel syndrome.
We will not be
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Well, yours too!

Where's Chandler?
Ah, he can not do it, he said he had his ... Whoa-oh!
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey, do I see you well? You're hiding behind the coats.
Ok, listen, just give me what I can do two of.
Well, if you have nothing to copy, why are you going over there?
Yeah, are you just going over there staring at that sexy girl with the navel ring again?
Yes! You want to come?
Yes!

Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
All right. We will go. It is not for another six hours. We will go then.

Hey.
What's up?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! I licked my neck !!
Oh Willie is still alive!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, my mother called, they'll make our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, I'm afraid it does not exist.
It's not true, there are some nice pictures of us!
No, there are great photos of you standing next to a guy who's going like that
My God! That's the creep you're with
I do not know what it is, I can not make a good figure.
Oh, here's a big one.
Yes, I'm not here.
I know, but look at me: all tan.
Hey, why do not you go for portraits made by a professional photographer.
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! you know
It is fantastic! Beside that, Chandler will not look so stupid.
Chandler, what are you talking about?
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
