In addition, I was responsible for my company's transition from the KL-5 system to the GR-6 system.
You must have had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.
So let's talk a bit about your functions.
My functions? Okay.
Now you will be running an entire division, so you will have a lot of tasks.
I see.
But there may be 30 people under you so you can pay a certain amount.
Good to know.
We can go into details
No, please!
All right, we'll have a definitive answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence that you'll be fine.
Really?!
Absolutely. You can relax you have been excellent.
But who? The waitress I dated last month?
You know? Forget it!
No no no no no! Who were you talking about?
No, I-I-I-I do not know, I do not know
Okay!
Okay, well ...
I will see if I can have a room for the night and I ...
I will see you later!
Yes of course!

Hello my.
Hey hey. You want to hear something that fears.
I never have.
Chris says they are closing the bar.
No way!
Yes, apparently, they make it a kind of coffee.
Just coffee! Where are we going to go out now?
Had me.
May I have a beer?
Hey, did you choose a roommate?
You betcha!
Is this the Italian guy?
Um-mm, yeah that's it!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What what?
What?!
He was with her when he wrote this poem.
Look, 'My ship is empty with nothing inside.
Now that I have touched you, you seem ever more empty.
He thinks Monica is empty, she's the empty vase!
Do you really think that's what he meant?
Oh, totally. Oh, my God, oh, she seemed so happy.
Completed.

Hey!
Hi!
What are you doing here?
Ah, you know, this building is on my road paper so I ...
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
How did that happen?
Oh, well, the woman I interviewed was pretty tough, but thank God, guided me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she became happy and did not I did not want to be silent.
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
Look, I'm ah, I'm sorry for being so crazy and jealous and it's just that I love you so much, so ...
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
American.
Ameri-ccan.
American. You know it's a
Everybody!!

Good job Joe! Good game! Excellent!
You have loved? You really liked?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
What part exactly?
The whole! Can we go?
Oh no-no-no, give me some details.
I love the details, the details were the best part!
Hey, what about the kangaroo scene? Did you like this part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in an epic of the First World War.
You fell asleep!!
There was no kangaroo!
They did not take any of my suggestions!
It's to come my friend.
I will see you later.
Do not leave!
I am sorry.
I am really sorry!
Look!
This guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too!
Be angry with him!
Or call an ambulance.

Ok, listen, I think we have to tell Rachel that she ruined her dessert.
What?! What's with everyone? It's Thanksgiving, not ... the day of truth!
Yes, and I long to have this ring.
See, if I am not buried with this ring then my mind will wander in the lower world for all eternity
Ok, that's enough darling!
I do not know. Let me see the ring.
Awesome! Ok, here.
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And

What did you do?
Oh, you know, as usual, teach aerobics, party a lot too much.
Oh, and in case you're wondering, these are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you hold on for a moment? I have another call. I love it.
I know.
I returned.
So, are we going to meet or what?
Absolutely. Uh, how are you tomorrow afternoon? Do you know, Central Perk in the village, for example, five o'clock?
Great, I see you then.
Okay. Okay. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even if you make a good impression Bob, I think when she sees you tomorrow, she'll probably realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
I hope that when Bob does not show up, she will look for comfort in the open arms of the ironic stranger at the next table.
Oh my God. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure hurt, horny and alone. I did this

Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You would not believe what people put here!
Look!
Ok, does it look like a trash for you?
No.
This is my wedding.
Okay, you know what? We are really late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go !!
Well. You will watch it on video when we return.
That's Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, let's go! Goodbye, Pheebs!
Goodbye, Pheebs!
London baby !!
Oh, do you need a hug? You have nothing to bring me!

Hey!
Hey! So Estelle has organized a series of auditions for me tomorrow and I will recover my health insurance in a short time.
It's great, but should not you be in the bathroom immediately?
What?!
What's wrong?
Nothing!
Well, I had that blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, and then I fainted and uh, I have not been able to get up since.
But uh, I do not think it's serious.
It looks like a hernia. You must go to the doctor!
No way! "Kay, look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything, it will be because it gets me out of the stomach!
It's a hernia.
Why do I have to start exercising again? Cursed 15s!

I like your place! Where does this guy come from?
Uh, it's an 18th century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Oh wow! So, you are more than dinosaurs.
So much more.
Well, to summarize, we have fun, you look young.
Okay
But that's not enough. So here is the key to my apartment.
Really?!
Really.
You do not think it's too fast.

Get out!
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes please! So what's going on?
Uh, well ... Joey and I broke up.
Oh my God, what happened?
Joey is a great guy, but we are just ... so different! I mean, during your speech, he continued to laugh at homo erectus!
I knew it was him!
Anyway, I think it's for the best.
Hey, how are you?
I suppose.
There was hum ... there was another reason why I thought it was time to finish with Joey.
I began to realize that I had feelings for someone else.
Ok Geller. The last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Oh, Professor, we're kind of in a conversation here.
Yeah, can you throw it in the pool later?
Or we could throw you both into
Ok guys!
Please!
Are not we a little old for that?
I mean, we are scientists, right?
We are academics.
And more importantly ... you'll have to catch us first.
.
GO GO GO!

Go Go go!
Oh yes, now everyone wants to be under that hat!
Oy !!
What's all this sand?
Oh, yes, Bob said there could be flood damage.
Yeah, that's it, or he has a very big cat.

Ok, you see that blind guy right there? I'll break his head later.
Oh uh, my big scene is coming. Great scene to come.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling." Would she understand the difference?
Rachel? What are you doing?
Oh, I just can not look. It's too scary!
It's a diaper advertisement.
Oh yeah, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh !!!
Pizza delivery!
I will have it! I'll have that!
Hi!
Hi!
Hey, you want to eat something or uh, do you want to see how long you can throw that ball back and forth? Huh?
Uh, the ball thing.
Yeah?
Hey Ross, would not it be great if we could spend two hours running without dropping it ?!
uh
Okay!
Uh-oh.
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel is in the bathroom!
Dude, I did not think we were going to get there!
I know! Do not change hands, okay?

Hey.
Hey!
How did it go with Erin?
Oh, amazing! We had the best time!
Yay !! Oh yes, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
No!
No!
No!
You were absolutely right!
It's so much better than the first time we went out.
You know?
It was so weird that we were really nervous.
You did not sleep together?
Yes, it really calms me down.
And!
We have so much in common!
She loves sandwiches, sports, even if she is a fan of the Met, it's not a problem at the moment, but if we had kids,
Oh my God! I'm listening to you talk about having children. Oh my Joey. Oh, please do not get married before me.
Okay.

How does she do that?
I can not sleep in a public place.
Do you want to watch it? She is so peaceful.
Oh! What what? ...Hi.
It's good, you know, you've just knocked yourself out.
What's going on with you?
I did not sleep last night!
Why?
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they are both a bit insecure in bed.
Oh, and deaf.
So, they must constantly reassure each other to have fun.
You do not know how strong they are!
If you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thank you.
Ew! What is it? Something has exploded!
It's just his water break. Calm down, will you?
Break water, what do you mean? What is water that breaks?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

Are you crazy? I mean, Joey, go kill yourself, he'll kill you.
Okay! Do not you think I thought about that?
How can you not know which one?
I mean it's amazing.
I mean, was it Gina?
Which one is Gina?
Black and tall hair, with the earrings of the plane.
No, no, no, it's Dina.
You see, you can not tell which one is which one either, dwha !!
I do not know, you thought "See you on Saturday" was funny.
Look honey, Mark is in fashion, all right, I like having a friend with whom I can share things like that.
You would never want to go to a conference with me.
Pa-haa !! I would like to go with you.
Really!?
Yes, I have clothes, I choose them even.
I mean, because I know I could be a fashion designer.
Okay. Honey, I'd like you to come with me. What?
What should I wear, now I am nervous.

: I know, we did it !! Hey, it was amazing, huh ?!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
: Thank you, listen, thank you very much Tribbiani ,. Oh my God, look at the time, I have to take the bus for the ball.
Oh, ok, good luck.
Yeah.
Unless you want to practice Foxtrot again? Where is the Tango?
: Ahh, thank you but no. You see, I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Okay.
Yeah.
Go get them Treeger.
: Right. Hey, do you want to come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really?
: Yes, you could dance very well with her, she is the same size as me.
No, it's okay.

Oh my God, it's so stressful! How do you do that?
Unfortunately, I do not get many reminders then
Is it a good sign that they asked us to stay after the audition?
Who knows?
Okay, we've reduced the number of people to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye! So long! Later!
Oh that's great! I could even play Ben's father!
Yeah!
In fact, this can not happen.
Yes, because you all look so different, we put you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
So it will be either you two or you two.
Dude, it's going to be a little weird.
Yeah, that's it.
No, we're going to be like best friends, that's why it's going to be weird.

Ok, come on, I can not get married until I have something old, new, borrowed and blue.
Ok, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Ok, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Please!
Are you kidding?
I ... I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose - I mean ... I'm not proud of that, but I really am.
And all because of you, wonderful, amazing.
I think you have a concussion.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
You are welcome. I am sorry. Did I hurt you?
It's worth it. You know what, you know what? It's not.

Wow! This Mike thing was interesting! I do not know what will happen with Phoebe and David.
I do! You want a clue? eh? "I do, I do it".
Ok, I feel like it's kind of a play on words, because you're pink with barely controlled joy.
David will propose to Phoebe.
What? Why?
Because we were talking about ways to defeat Mike, I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Chandler, we talked about it.
You are not supposed to give people advice!
Now, could not you just do some kind of inappropriate joke?
I
They've only been out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hooked on Mike!
She will say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover and Phoebe will be left alone
Man, it's a little
Oh, that's not what you want ...

This is my dad, Paul Stevens. Dad, it's Ross Geller.
It's a pleasure to meet you Paul.
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to speak to me as Mr. Stevens.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
So Ross, what's your problem?
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
Why can not you have a girlfriend of your age?
Now that's funny. Umm. It's not funny.
I
Okay.
I can, I can see that.
Uh, but I think if you give me a chance, I can change my mind.
Okay.
What?
Okay. I will give you a chance to change your mind. You have a minute.
Dad!
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, okay, I'll bring you a tape, huh?
So, do you have Matt Lauer's clothes here? May be? Just those who have not been cleaned yet?

Ooooohh!
Oh yes, I'm sure. And suddenly, his hands were no longer the problem.
Was it ...?
Oh, scouts could have camped here.
"Ooo", what?
Uma Thurman.
Oh!
The actress!
Thank you Rachel.
So, what are you going to do?
You must tell him!
You must tell him!
It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist problem!
Guys?
Guys?
Oh, yes, you must tell him.
Feminist question. That's where I went!
She will hate me.
Yes, well ...

Would you marry me?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Yes, you have the ring?
Yes, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Oh! Oop!
OK, now, are you going out of here? I want it to be a surprise and she will know it.
Yeah-yeah guys. Get out of here!
Hi guys.
You are beautiful.
Oh thank you! What is going on?
We are really excited about this charity event we need to attend.

Ok, Ross?
I'm very hot, so I'm going to take off my sweater.
Now, I'm letting you know it's
Yes! It's hilarious!
I am sorry. I'm finished. I'm finished.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Not really. I mean, you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Okay. Ok, that's right! But you know I do not bother so easily.
What?! You are totally embarrassed!
No I do not! Ross, I think I'm just a safer person than you.
Is it true?
Yeah.
Hey lady! I do not care how much you want it! Okay?! I am

I can not believe!
I did it!
I cycled!
I never thought I could do that!
Thank you Ross.
Oh hey, do not thank me, thank you yourself. You are the one who faced his fears and finally overcame them.
Well yes, but then
Yeah-Not-but-but-but-but! We are just going home and taking a shower. Now, it's not scary, is it?
It depends on what you mean by us.

Hey, both of you should be up there with me.
I mean, you two are my, I mean, I'm lucky to just have a good
Thanks dude.
I have to go check something here.
What baby
Wuss total!

David?
Phoebe! Hi!
Oh my God!
Wow, you look amazing.
Yeah. What are you doing here?
Well, I'm back from Minsk ... permanently.
What happened?
Well, remember how I was trying to achieve positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Yeah?
After eight years of research, I discovered that it was impossible.
It's great that you're back! How are you?
Well, well, life is beautiful ...
Well!
Oh, I see someone.
Oh, good for you.
She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and ... well, it's actually because of you, really, we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with this guy from Mike, and I just said "Boy, I want this".
Mike and I broke up.
This means that we can continue to try, but there is a good chance that this will never happen to us.
Oh my God!
I am sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Well, we will ... we will understand that.
I know.

Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes that you can try.
Wow! It looks great!
Yeah! Ok, this one is a mushroom hat. Umm, this one is made of Bologna.
And-and-and-and-and-toothpicks?
You kissed another woman!
Call it the same ?!
Okay!
Well, I'll go get them in the water.
Wait, have you stolen the wedding of these people?
No-no, I took them in the lobby of the hotel.
Yeah, they think they can charge me for a dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they have another idea in mind.
Hey!
My sweater!
I'm looking for that for a month!
Oh my God!!
Oh my God!

Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you're supposed to be!
Huh?
Because I really can not understand it!
I speak to you and nothing.
You look at me, and it's nothing.
Nothing.
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you have a story, that's nice.
I have a question about this scene.
Yes?
Well, I do not understand why Adrienne is attracted to Victor.
Peel the onion. First of all, he is handsome.
Yeah.
I think my character will need a little more reason than that.
Oh, hey, how about this one.
Ah, it says in the script!
You know ah, I-I do not know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script that you're a slut.
It does not say that in the script.
It does it in mine!

I can not
Yeah! You have to tell a girl before recording it. Such a rookie error.
You know who has an excellent video camera?
Greg and Jenny?
Do you still want to call them? I want to call them.
Let's call them.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought any souvenirs to their friends!
Hello? Eighth Deli Street?
Hey, hang up! You have food poisoning just by talking to this place.
Sorry, wrong number.
Here you are.
Hello? It's still the sausage!
Okay! I'm going to have a sandwich!
I do not think this number is accurate!
Oh come on !!

I have to go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's really late now
Hi Mom. Listen, I made an appointment with Dr. Bazida and ... Excuse me? Did you know it's not mom?
Her name is Ronni. She is a pet.
Sure. So how long has it been ...
Do you remember when you were little, I took you to the navy yard and showed you the big ships?
Since?!
No, it's only been six years.
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so that you know that I have not always been such a terrible guy.
... Joe.
Have you ever been in love?
... I know.
So you have not. You burn your tomatoes.
You are one to talk.
Joe, your father is very much in love. And the worst is with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me that one of them is Ma.
Of course, of course, one of them is Ma. What's your problem?

Everything will be alright. Okay, Dick?
Hi, I'm Guru Saj - Whoa !! It's supposed to be a duck, right? Because otherwise, it's waaay out of my league.
Hey, Rachel, how was the job?
Oh great. Although I sat where there was no chair.
By the way, Ross has fallen into a box of your things.
Oh, well, I guess that was the one that was coming.
I'm just going to throw it away, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and ...
Something is wrong?
No nothing.

And then, and then you talked about what the Mesozoic era would be in the 21st century.
Yeah, that's it?
Yeah.
Yes !!
We are Zack teeth!

Dude, I'm sorry for what I said!
No, no, you're right, it's a ridiculous name!
It's not so bad.
Yes it is! From now on, I do not have a name.
So, are you just Bing?
Because we have won our apartment!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
No! Ace is weak! Ace, two, three, four!
I do not know. Ooh! Ooh! Look! Ah-ha!
Very good, cut, resume, resume.
Okay.
Come in apartment! Come in apartment! Oh! I know that the queen is high!
Uh-huh, not as high as it worked! King!
Yes baby!
But we resume! We pick up again!
Why?!
I do not know!
Tickets please! This is the baby yard!
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so crazy about? They recover the apartment!
No they did not!

You know, I do not think we brought enough material. Have you forgotten to pack the baby's anvil?
It will be worth it.
It's a known fact that women love babies, okay?
Women love guys who love babies.
It's this sensitive thing.
Quick, point it to that group of girls there.
Maybe one of them will escape.
No, no wait, to have them, we have one, badly gone.
All right, give me the baby.
No, I got it.
No seriously.
Oh, seriously, do you want it?
Hello.
Well, do not think me shameless, but me?
Do you want to feel it?
Oh yes. He has that sweet smell of baby. Get a whiff of his head.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
Well, we are great guys.
Goodbye.

Well not really.
I mean technically it's not against the rules or anything, but it's frowned upon.
In particular by the professor we met last night, Judge von Holierthanthou.
Well, Ross, be careful now. You do not want to have a reputation as you know, Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What should I do?
Well Ross, that seems pretty clear.
I mean what's more important?
What do people think or how do you feel, huh?
Ross, you must follow your heart.
Joey it's so nice.
Hey.
Hey hey! So, how did it go with Dana? One reason I should leave an open block of time, says Thursday?
I could not do it.
You could not do it?
Hey, relax, I just need more time. We are going to dinner tonight.
What?! You're still going out with her!
To go out with whom?
Uh, Dana Keystone from the university.
Oh yes! Was not she uh
No, it was Dana Caplin.
Joey! You did not even know her!
Ah no matter!

Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my robot boyfriend ?!
Do not touch it!
Okay!
Okay.
Umm, Wayne, at the same level as me.
Okay?
I continue to hear all these rumors that I could be fired.
Okay, they even have actors who come to read for me!
Come on man, you have to give me a second chance!
I mean, I like-I love this little guy!
Ah ah!
Ok, that's why you did not want me to touch him, did you?
Here!
Okay?
Stupid!
I can not believe!
God!
Hey, how are you?

Hey.
Hi. Look uh, about what happened earlier ...
No, hey, well, I understand perfectly. You were, you were stressed.
I was going to give you a chance to apologize.
Why? For letting me throw myself out of your office?
You did not have
Yeah, excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our wedding anniversary, boy, I'm a con
But I told you that I did not have time!
Yeah, well, you never have time. I mean, I do not feel like I have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
You want me, do you want me to leave my job so that you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
I know.
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
What?
But I can not tell you.
Okay, but it would not be easier if you had to tell me something you could tell me.
Well, of course, in a perfect world. But no, I promised not to say anything and I swore to love all my gods.
Okay. Does this have to do with Ross and Rachel?
No.
Does it have to do with Joey?
No.
Does it have to do with Chandler and that sock he keeps close to his bed?
No, but let's go back to that later!

Hi!
Richard!
In fact, I'm not here to complete the chef.
Oh, oh, I'm fine when people come back to accompany the chef.
Since I have nothing better to do!
So what's up?
It was great to see you the other night.
Oh, nice to see you too. Did you come here to tell me that?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you that I still love you.

One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be fine.
So, forcing her to marry Bobby is going to get there?
May be! Well! Well, then, uh, what kind of music Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can not!
Joey, I'm very scared of that.
But I really think I can do it, I'm just going to need help.
And Bobby will be here all the time.
You speak that I am! And to answer your previous question, we are rap for gangsters.
Listen, Rachel told me how easy you had made it. Why can not you do that for me?
Because! Because you are my little sister!
And you are my big brother!
I mean, you are my favorite guy in the whole world.
I'm not even afraid to talk to mom and dad about it.
I was afraid to tell you.
I would be afraid of them, but okay.
Joey, I can not stand the idea of ​​having this baby with you angry with me.
I want him to have his uncle.
Will my baby have his uncle Joey?
Of course he's going to have his uncle Joey!
We will be fine. I mean, even if we are not married, this baby will be so loved. Not only by us.
It is true! By his uncle too!
And by you
Ok Bobby, why do not you come here and give them a moment.
Come here!
No! Seriously! What's wrong?!

I had a great time tonight.
Me too. I'm really glad Monica invited us.
I would love to ask you to come in, but my sister is visiting and I think she sleeps on the couch.
Are you a sister? Your sister is asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, it's Rachel.
Hi!
Nice to meet you. I wish you told me we had company, I would repair myself!
As if it would help.
You are so bad!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are so dead! I'll take you.
Uh, it was very nice to meet you.

Oh my God, this is Victoria's Secret model. Something ... something from Goodacre.
Hi mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I'm stuck in an ATM lobby with Jill Goodacre!
Yes, I'm fine I'm stuck in the bank, in an ATM lobby.
Jill says vestibule ... I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone ... I do not know, a guy.
Oh! A guy. A guy. Hey Jill, I saw you with a guy last night. Yes he was

I say, drew!
Do you see someone right now?
Og-ee-op, I do not ask for me, I mean no, I'm not gay, I'm not asking you to go out
I am not I am not I am not gay!
Personal purchases? What is it? Do you like where you walk with wealthy rich people and tell them what to buy?
Uh-huh.
That sounds good!
Hey!
Uh, excuse me, we changed apartment. You can not eat anymore, it's food, this sauce train has ended.
There is sauce?
If you have the big apartment, you have to deal with people who come all the time.
This refrigerator needs to be filled, okay, it's now your department.
What are you doing?
I think I left a donut here.

So, in conclusion, the lines go up, so I'm happy.
Great work team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.
Phil!
Good work.
Stevens!
Path to follow!
Joel-burg, maniac!
I love you!
Bing!
Good job, I could not have done it without you.
Thank you sir.
Oh excuse me. I forgot my towel, you know, by accident.
Of course you did.
Forgot something else too bastard!
And you?
You do not feel left behind or anything?
No, not at all, it's ridiculous.
Everyone has one, and you want one too. Is not it?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do it!
Now, get out of here, you!

Hi Bob.
Hey! How's my friend Toby today?
If I see him, I will ask.
Toby!
Eh eh! Bing? Was it six-year-old Bob that you just mentioned too?
Yeah!
Oh, so you know each other.
We are semi-first name.
What do you think of adding it to our team?
Bob? Ooh, work here with us? Everyday? Yes, I do not know if he has what it takes.
Really? They like it at six o'clock.
But it's eleven. It's almost twice as difficult here.

Hey! Guess what I have for your wedding!
A lean and weird appointment with a hanger for the head?
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tuxedo! But not just any, the Batman tux!
What?
It is true! Made specifically for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit movie in which he was filmed by Batman.
You can not wear that! I'm wearing the famous tuxedo! The James Bond tuxedo!
So?
So if you wear this, you will make mine less special.
Sorry, I do not like the idea of ​​saying when I say "yes", he says to himself, "Yeah, I'll do it too!"
Well, we still have a problem.
Yeah!
With what?
Well, we are trying to find someone to celebrate our wedding and they are all boring or boring or you know, they can not stop watching women.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, we get
No! No! It's ... it's a real thing! Anyone can be ordered on the Internet and perform as a wedding or anything else!
Are you serious?
Yes! One of my friends did it and it's totally legal!
I call him!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much, but none of you are getting married to us.
Does calling it mean nothing ?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!

You see, I see ... a great passion in your future.
Really?
I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she rubs her head and stands up]
It's never going to happen.

Everyone knows!
It was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
Look, Monica, I know, all right, you know, I could not sleep for a month because of a dot of ink on one of the couch cushions.
Well, you could turn the cushion over.
Yeah, I would have unless I had a big patch of spaghetti on the other side.
What?!?!
Ok, that's what I'm talking about. I need to live in a country where people can spread.
You can reverse. In the sink.
Aw, darling, it's not your fault, you know, who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I continue to live here, I do not see it.
I love you too.
Aww, well. What?
What? I just said.
No you are not, you wonder what cushion it is.

Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Uh-huh.
I would like to live with you Ross; It's awesome! Thank you!
Well, I'm just happy to help you.
Wow! I am so happy for you. It's not terrible, not stupid.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what that means to me!
I mean, I mean, I'm going to be homeless.
You just saved me!
You are my hero!
Hero, I uh, I do not know, okay.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please! You will say things now, will not you?
No.
No, I will not do it.
But I should tell you this, it's exactly the same thing that happened to my roommate Denise.
She moved with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he did not like it, but he did it, and it just exploded!
And that's how she ended up living with me!
Ok, it's a lie.

Ugh!!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross's house.
Oh, I must miss counting or something.
Heck!
She is not there anymore.
Oh, I'm watching, Ross is watching the movie.
No Joey, I think he's just watching TV.

... damn it, hire the girl! Ok, everyone is ready?
Uh, listen, I just want to thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the dress.
Me?
It's awesome.
Well, I'll take another espresso. Can I get you another coffee with milk?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's all?
Yes, it was really difficult.
Oh, yes, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Ok, you were not there.

Wow! It's ah, it's pretty cool!
Not bad?
You will have to forgive my roommate, he wanted to get married to that.
We do not have $ 50, but would you be willing to trade for it? We have a canoe.
You know, I, I really do not think we need a canoe.
You have to take the canoe!
All right, just take the entertainment center, then when you get home, throw the canoe!
We do not throw it! I built this canoe!
Good for you!!

Pheebs?
Yeah?
Okay. So I guess that's right, wait here then. Hi. I need a fake ticket for Yemen.
A ticket for Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just need a fake ticket.
I'm sorry sir, I do not understand.
What would you give to a child if he wanted a ticket to play?
Do you travel with a child?
No.
Okay, you know what, she's going to think I'm giving you a credit card, but what I'm really going to do is give you a library card.
Sir, a ticket to Yemen costs $ 2,100 and we do not take library cards.
What's the problem? Something is wrong? Do you have to stay?

Okay, but it's the last time.
With a chick here and a chick there.
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick - chickeeeen.
Hey.
Hey.
How is she?
She?
Well, do not you think she's a girl?
I do not know. I can not say, which has never been back too fast.
Anyway, I have to change, I meet actors for a drink.
Excuse me?
What?
Ok, well, so that's it. Go with Vince.
Yes, but Jason is really sensitive.
Although sensitive is important, choose it.
Yeah.
Oh, of course, go with the wet chicken.
Jason is not a sissy!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.

Hi.
So, uh, apparently, people know the history of Europe?
Yeah.
Listen to that, everyone, um, who came across who does not matter.
I mean, I think it would have happened anyway.
I mean, if you did not initiate it, I-I-I know I would have it.
It was an incredible night.
It was. It was an incredible night.
You think it was incredible?
Do we still have a name?
Not yet.
That's good, for now we're going to call it Baby Girl Green.
Oh no, little girl Geller-Green.
Hello Little Girl

Ah-ha, nowhere to go!
I do not like sitting here! I'm just going to finish
No Rachel! They arrived first!
Why does Ross do that?
DANGER
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on these women!
No, it's okay. Do not worry about that.
Oh, look! It will leave a stain!
Rachel! Hey! It's good! You're at Joey's!
Really?
Yeah! Look!
I have never lived like this before.
I know.
Okay, do not waste it, I'm talking about his still food.

Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
I do not know, but one of the extras did it! Hi, listen, Rach. Thank you again for coming to watch my scenes!
Oh, please! Honey, the fact that you want me to be here to support you is ... OH MY GOD! Is it Christian Sanders? He is so
Also so
Oh, in my head, he did pretty "not gay stuff"!
Well, at Christmas, he and Santa Claus did some really gay stuff!
OK, you must promise that you will never tell Ross that I told you.
On what?
He is preparing your birthday party.
Oh my God! I love it!
You better act surprised.
On what?
My surprise party!
What a surprise party?
Oh stop. Joey already told me.
Well, he did not tell me.
Hey, do not look at me. It's Ross's thing.
It's so typical. I am always the last to know everything.
No you are not. We tell you things.
Yuh-huh!
I was the last to know when Chandler was bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
I was the last to know when you had a crush on Joey when he moved in.
Looks like I was penultimate.

Chandler, your father still has not sent an answer.
Oh! Right. Uh, maybe it's because I did not send him an invitation.
Chandler! It's your father; he should be at the wedding.
I do not even know the man. Okay? We are not so close. I have not seen him for years.
What are you going to do when he finds out that we did not even ask him ?!
Well, he does not need to know!
It's not like we're running in the same circles.
I spend time with you guys and he plays in a show in Las Vegas.
Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.
Believe me, you do not want it either.
Okay?
No one is going to look at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a dress without back.
So what! As long as he does not wear a white dress or sail, I do not care.
Okay, I think I need to go shopping.

Hi! Who is here?
It's okay'?
Who are you?
I guess you would not believe me if I said I'm Kurt Douglas, huh?
No, no, Rachel, do not understand! He can not see us!
No Yes! The groom can not see the bride!
I'm not going to marry Chandler!
Not after that!
Ok, guys, relax. I doooo.
I have to go.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, oughta do it.

Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Okay.
So, Pheebs, what's the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well, yes, but then I remembered that I had started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was at the top of the pyramid but anyway, uh, what is this book?
Excuse me, may I, can I burn one?
OK, all right, what's so funny here?
I thought you had not smoked.
Oh, I thought you meant marijuana cigarettes, you know?
Do you know what I mean, like dubbies?
And actually, I thought, "Wow, these guys are crazy!"
But no, I actually smoke all the regulars, all the time.
We get high.
Oh me too.
I am kidding.
Oh me too.

Oh, are you sure you're fine?
Yeah.
Does it still hurt?
Yeah.
What a beautiful idea. All your clothes match. I will do that.
Hi.
Hey, how did it go?
Excellent.
We tore up this couple and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine.
You know what? You are right. I
Good for you Pheebs!
Okay.
Ok, if you also have microphones, I did not mean

That sucks! I did not know I had to stay up all night before going to this stupid sleep clinic! I am so tired!
It is 6 o'clock.
Yeah
Hi!
Hey, I heard that Joshua and you were going to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think it's really cool.
Yeah, Rachel, I think you're doing really well.
Manipulate it?
What do you mean by manipulation?
There is nothing to manage.
Now, maybe I'll have a problem with that if it were not for me and Joshua.
You know, they are not going to get married anyway!
What?
Come on!
They rushed into this case so fast that it's ridiculous!
I mean, are they going to be engaged for what?
One year?
And somewhere on the way, one of them will realize what he did and they cancel everything.
I tell you, you're going to dance at my wedding before dancing there.
What is that?!
What, did you think it would reassure me to give me things that I will not be able to use for two months ?!
That sucks!
Okay, what's my next present?
!

Okay, there is a nuclear holocaust, I am the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
I have some preserves.
Hey guys! Look at this! Look at this baby, dug me a hole!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole !!
Ow !! Ow !!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
My drink?
Oh, I had to say that after you left.
Say what? Exactly.
That you enjoyed the occasional excessive consumption of drinks.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that's it! I leave! You are just a horrible person!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
If you become very sensitive about it!
I do not want to lose you.
What if I create a job for you?
I will make you a buyer assistant in this department.
Say more things like that.
You can have your own office and an increase! In force tomorrow.
I would need an expense account.
Completed!
And an assistant.
Sophie, come here!

Monica? You will be very proud of me. I have just received appointments with two incredibly cute nurses.
Oh my!
They are nurses.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us on Saturday night! What are you saying?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I do not think so.
What?
What are you talking about?!
It was you who told me to defeat Ross and move on.
I pass, and you continue with me.
Come on, give me a good reason why you do not want to go.
Umm, why not give
What?
Harder than it looks. Is not it?
Okay, you come with me and I also told them that if we're still there when they go down, we'll go to the cafeteria and have a few
Yes! There is always room for
Joey, how are you doing
Oh, it's easy. Yes, I can do it with anything. Look uh, grandma's chicken salad

Hello, it's Monica ...
Yeah???
Oh...
OK, yes, we'll be right, we'll go down.
Thank you.

Okay. Bring it on.
Wait no, honey, darling, throw it at me, throw it at me.
Here you are.
It almost hit my face.
A stripper at a bachelor party, it's so cliché. Why do not you have a magician ?!
Well, if the wizard can open my beer with his cheeks, then all is well.

Hey!
Hey!
You know, I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh my god, me too!
You know, I thought if we had a big fight and uh, we broke up for a few hours
Yeah?
Technically, we could make love again. What do you think, authoritarian and domineering ?!
The marriage is extinguished, sloppy and immature!
It's me! Come on!
Okay. But wait, we can not. My cousin Cassie is in the spare room, we are supposed to have lunch.
Well, get rid of her, haunting and shrill.
Acute?! The wedding is back!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you too.
So, are you ready to leave?
Yeah.
Chandler!
I will be right with you.

That's all, it's a third nipple.
You know?
Just your third running nipple.
You know?
You can remove it.
Cut out this baby right away!
Take off your shirt and see what it is. What are you doing?
I'm just showing you my third nipple at the end of the line.
It's not a third nipple.
No?
First of all, it's on your ass.
So what is it?
Wait a minute, hold on. Johnson! Do you want to come here for a moment?
I am with Hamilton!
He is good at things back, bring him too.

Uh, it's an excellent wine.
It's France in Europe Western Europe. You know, a few years ago, I was traveling all over western Europe.
Really?
Uh-hmm-Wait! It's improving. Uh, yes I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
Anyway, uh, I was ... I was hiking
I love to hike!
Oh that's great! I was walking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
I understood!
So? Congratulations you two, I did not even know you were married.
Oh we do not have.
No no. we
What?!
Uh, we are ... we only get this baby together, but that's all.
Why?!!
Well uh, we're just not here, see? But we are very excited about it.
Oh. So shut me up.
Tell me just how.
Uh-oh, I feel another coming.
Sid-you, lucky deaf bastard.

Drop it, Ross.
Yeah, well, you did not know Chi Chi.
Have you all promised?
Yeah! We promise! We will be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your little friend to filter must stay out!
Hey, Pheebs.
"Dear Mrs. Buffay.
Thank you for pointing out our mistake.
We credited your account with five hundred dollars.
We are sorry for the inconvenience and hope you will accept this -
Bye.
Yes?
What are you doing'?
Ooh.

Oh my God, darling, we are so made to be together. We both have copies of
Honey, both.
Hey! Good advice on this thing Joey!
Yeah? The problem of work?
Oh it was perfect! I mean it was really like he was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him?
Oh that's not important. The fact is that I really think that everything will be fine.

Ok, I have some, do you want to put them in her panties?
No thanks, mom!
Oh, no, hello, that, that, you have to say, because I'm pregnant.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Very good, so good.
I really, really appreciated. Very exotic.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua did not call.
I mean, you would think he would be worried that I would not come to his club.
Ugh, you know what makes matters worse, Ross is happy in Vermont!
Come on! Look where you are !!
When you get a second, another set of daiquiris.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And do not let me go without the name of this type of carpet.
Ahh, go! You know what, you know what, I think I'm just going home and calling Kathy.
Well, if you think that will help.
No!
It was a test!
In a few hours, I'm really going to get drunk and I want to call Kathy and you'll have to stop me!
And after that, I'm going to get drunk, I'm going to call Janice
You should! How is she?
Ohhh !!
I think someone needs another dance trick.

Okay, I definitely taste the nutmeg.
You do?
You do not? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layperson.
This and arrogance.
Hey.
Hey! How was the sail?
Wow thank you!
Joe?
Yeah!
Uh, did you have a lot of sex?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, that's just the reason I ask the question, it's because I could not, I mean, I really wanted to, but I could not.
Uh, there was an incident.
Do not worry about this man, it happens.
It happened to you?
Yeah! Once.
Well, what did you do?
I did it anyway.

'Supper? 'Yo dude?
Take what you want, please do not hurt me.
So you play a little
Yes, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the stupidest person can watch, you are 19 years old.
Come on man, how old are you ?!
Young! You are a child-man okay ?! Now go change because everyone is ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
And they knew?
Ok, Ross, what is it really about?
Look, it's at home and I want to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, I'll find another place to do the rest of my appointments. I just do not know what the problem is!
The big problem is that I do not want strangers naked and fat in my apartment when I want to relax with a beer-puzzle! Cold beer.

Ok, listen, it will not hurt them, right?
Do you still have to bring him back here?
I did not want to leave him alone.
Well?
We had our first fight this morning.
I think this has to do with my late work.
I said things that I did not want to say, and he threw dung ...
You know, if you go to work late, I could watch for you.
Oh, that would be great!
Okay, but if that's the case, make sure it looks like you're here to see it, all right, and you do not like doing it as a favor for me.
Okay, but if he asks, I will not lie.

Okay, check.
Look at this.
It says here that there is a place where you can go to rent videos from all museums!
"It's almost as good as being there."
It's better! You can not go to a museum in underwear!
Oh-ho! I bet the UK version is gooooood!

Uh, can I help you?
Yes, I spoke to you on the phone, I am the woman who got stuck with the race car bed.
It's like I told you, I can not do anything. You signed for this, Monica Velula Geller.
Okay, buffoon, look, we want to see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Hey! You can not go back!
Oh my God.

So, it must be pretty cool for you, huh?
I mean, your father told me that you have a few days off school and you no longer have to sell those cookies.
Well, I wanted to sell cookies a bit. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp and sits in a
Wow, you ah, do you really like all that space stuff, huh?
Yeah.
My father says that if I spent as much time helping him clean his apartments as dreaming about space, he could afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think a lot of flats should be cleaned to go to India.
No, in Atlantic City, daddy loves slot machines. He says he's going to double the money my grandmother left me in college.
Oh, I do not know if it's a good idea.
Oh. Listen, just friends, I will not stain you. I promise.
No, I just think it's too early.
No, it's not too early, I had lunch at eleven o'clock.

I invented cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now, you want to get that money back.
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for?
It's not a real game! I did it!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it.
I do not know.
But I can see through your leaf.
Yes it's her.
But what do you know?
No matter, I will never meet her anyway.
Why?
Because it is impossible to find his apartment! She lives in a universe parallel to a girl, or something like that.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, the seventh apartment on the left!
No no. She lives on the
No, those first two windows are the hall.
And you know each other over there, it's the stairs.
You did not count well.
I did

Monica, betting on the apartment, I do not know.
Rachel, I did not miss a question of the whole match. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Do you have the written answers there?
No! Stable like a rock! Now, are you with me?
All right, let's do it.
Come on!
Okay.
Okay, gentlemen, you're the first to get up.
Okay.
Okay.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalkeeper?
Big goalkeeper.
Correct. Rachel's complaints
Dangerous Liaisons
Correct. His current favorite film is ...
Weekend at Bernie's
Well, listen, why are not you just doing your Phase Two strip club with us?
Yeah, we can be guys!
No you can not.
Come on! Let's be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
You do not want to be guys, you'd be hairy and do not live that long.
You know, you stop mouthing and take off, you come with us and watch naked girls dancing!
Okay.
I am sorry.

And you know what, I just realized that in the past year, I only went out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
You have to help me here, you have to prepare me, you have to get me back in the game.
Well, that should not be a problem. I mean that I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible heterosexuals.
Pete, can I find you something else?
Yes, a piece of cheesecake and a date if given to you.
You and I have not touched on this?
Hmm, come on, you just told him you.
Oh, the only reason you want to go out with me because of my blonde wig, her big boobs and the fact that I'm serving you.
Well, if it were true, I would go out with Aunt Ruth.
And the two times we went out were just embarrassing.
Come on, you think she should go out with me, right?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
I mean, it's not a pretty picture in the morning, you know what I mean.
This wig is in disarray and her breasts thrown into the night, you know.
I mean really think about it.
Ho-ho, I'll do it.

I think I read that somewhere!
It's not funny, it's physically impossible!
Okay?
Depending on the species, I would have to be six feet long ...
It's not funny!
!
I respectfully disagree.
I can not believe you put that on my page of old!
We do not care? Nobody reads these things
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
I do not have a page.
Oh oh oh! I respectfully disagree !!

I know I miss you too. I can not wait to see you. I love you. Goodbye.
Ok, what's here? Rocks?
No, no, it's my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I will really miss this apartment. You know, Ben-Ben took his first steps there.
Ohh Hey, do you remember when I met this thing and it stunned me a bit?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I did not have to move.
Uh, are you saying that you're not completely happy with that?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me the choice
You
Why?
Hey guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift store. Get up! Get up! Get up!

I left a bra that dries on the shower rod, you do not think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatized?
Hey, if mom can have a wife, dad can have a bra.
Ohh, it's time to go.
Oh, no-no-no, you see, this clock is a little fast, we have 17 minutes.
Uh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
Two times?
Well, it's ambitious.
Hey, you can ignore that.
It's Carol with your son!
The morning is here! The sun is out! The sky is clear, the morning has arrived! The morning is here!
HEY !! Do you
Oh come on! The morning is here! The morning is here! The morning is here! The sun is out!
I
Are you kidding? I love this guy! The morning is here! The morning is here-
Stop that! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica, you do not even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
You know what? I am
I am sorry. I am really sorry.
Okay.
See, it's a
Shut up! This place is a hole!

Very good friend, it's time to turn around.
No no!
No, no-n-n-n-no !!
You go to a clinic!
You go to a clinic and a pajamas shop!

Are you under the sheet?
Yes.
Great, let's start. How is the pressure?
Pleasant! Wow Phoebe you are good!
By stating an obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird, that's it.
No. Ooohh
That's right, you just enjoy.
Oh. Oh yes! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yes!
Okay.
Oh my God Phoebe !! Oh that's it! That's all! Just there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh

Hi!
Oh, Alice, hello!
Thank you.
I'm so glad you could come because I have an emergency at home.
Oh my God, who died about it ?!
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-disaster. Can you help me?
Become a theater critic!
I am hurt! A plague on your two houses!
By the way, he dropped me tonight after reading my report.
Oh, class.
Yes! I know how to choose them, huh? You know I gave up a soap party for that!
Wow! Yes, I gave up my job too.
Really. What?
Uh, scratch cats.
Hey, I tell you what.
Let me take you home.
We will go to each newsstand and burn each copy of their newspaper.
Why post?
Oh, did not you see the Post?
No you?
No why?

Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Uh, well I have an audition in the street and I spilled the sauce on the front of my shirt. Do you have one more?
Yes of course. Umm here.
Awesome. You have something that is not
Yes, I do not think so, Joe.
Okay, I guess it'll be fine.
Hey, listen, what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, why?
What would you think about taking out my tag assistant? I will pay.
Uh, Rachel, I have to say it's going to take a lot of money for me to go out with a guy.
I'm not asking you to go on a
Really? Because I could use the money.
Joey, he just came to town and I know he has no friends.
Just take it to like a ball game or something.
I will really appreciate it.
Yeah OK.
Yeah?
Sure no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Yeah!
Okay.

Odor problem in litter? Do not change your kitten, change your kitten litter.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Yeah. It's okay?
No! Sorry, I just thought you were someone else. Hi!
Hi. Listen, I was just going to leave a message, is not your big birthday dinner tonight?
Yeah. Well, uh .....
Rachel, how are you?
Yes, I'm fine
You want to talk, I mean can I come?
No! Really, no, please, please, it's okay.
Okay, okay, I'm coming and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Oh, yes, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
It's for me.
Oh. Okay goodbye.

Go, pick up, pick up!
Hello?
Transit Authority?
Yes hello.
I'm researching for a book and wondering what someone could do if he left a baby in a city bus.
Yes, I realize it would be a very stupid character.
Hi, here's the deal.
We lost a seat on a bus today.
It is white plastic, with a handle and fits a stroller.
Oh, and there was a baby in there.
He wants to talk to you again.

Hello.
I'm sorry I'm a little late.
Ah - Whoa!
Many late.
Let me start with, uh, introducing myself, I'm Professor Geller.
So, to summarize, I'm Professor Geller.
Good job today.

Good evening sir.
My name is Ross Geller.
I am one of the people who applied for the apartment.
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry.
I can not help but notice that you are naked and I applaud you.
Dude, I'd like to be naked.
I mean, it looks so great.
That's how God wanted it.

Okay, I have to tell you something that I never admitted during all our friendship!
But when we were in high school, I went out with James Farrell even when I knew you loved him!
Wow, it's so nice to empty my chest!
Ok, you go there!
My turn? What are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know for you and Chandler.
What?!
I heard you on the phone the other day and you said, "I'm just going to tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a few hours."
And he said, "Laundry?
is
Well. Looks like you're writing a little game yourself, Rach. Wow! Let me know how it turns out.
Well, I would not know because I got so freaked out that I hung up.
Well, if you had continued to listen, you would have heard me call him Mr. Big ot.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He says the most
Okay. So you tell me there's nothing between you and Chandler.
Chandler and me ?!

I really thought you were making a good point. I mean, you know, until you're cut.
Yeah, what's up with this girl Monica?
I do not know! I did not come with her!
Very good everyone! Everyone guesses what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
An exam?!!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yes! We should have some questions for development !!

Ok, I have one for you, if you also had which one would you prefer to eat, a guide dog or a gorilla that speaks?
I would have to say the gorilla who speaks, because at least I can explain to him that you make me eat.
Someone went to college. Sensational. What is it? I am sorry.
Ok, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay on the spot.
I think it's better sir.
But we really have to find someone here.
The work begins to accumulate.
I have a stack of documents on my desk so high.
You know what you should do, just throw them in the shed and pretend you never have them.
It's a good one.
What a guy has to

Yes, everyone is here. Hello everyone, say hello to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi julie
Is there not a national football league?
Yes. Yes, they play on Sunday and Monday nights.
Oh shoot! I work on Monday night.
Umm, this joke is amazing. Do you think we should bring them?
When they are hungry enough, they will enter.

Hey Joey, did you want to talk to me?
I do not know. Do you have something for me?
Oh, it's Rachel.
Ten. Okay. Now, Tag, there are too many women.
Really?
Yes for you!

Oh, Danielle! I did not expect the machine ... Call me when you get the chance. Bye. Oh my God!
It is
Hey, I've done it!
What was there with the dishes?
Oh, uh ..
I want her to think that I could be in a restaurant .. you know?
I could have a kind of life, as if I had not sat here perfecting these last hours.
Look look! He does it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop watching here!
Great, now he waved his hand.
Dude, we have to do something about this guy.
This morning, I caught him staring into our apartment.
That scares me!
I feel that I can not do things!
What kind of things?
Grow up you? I do not talk about sexy things, but when I cook myself.
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal ... nothing splashes.
What are you looking at me? I did not know that.

You know they say that a monitored pot never beeps.
It's been just a few hours, and she did not call. Not that I care, you know.
Phoebe, why do not you call him? You obviously want.
You think you know me so well.
Well, you do not want?
Yeah.
Ok, well I know you.
That's what I said.
Well then?
I can not
I can not
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was "OK, goodbye Pheebs".
You know what's sad, when we play together, it's like the most fun I've ever had, like all my life.

Okay, bye. Monica will not come, it will be just me and Rachel.
Oh. Keep camper, are you sure you thought about this thing?
It's a laundry. The reflection is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just you two? It's a date. You are going to a date.
Nuh uh.
Yuh-huh.
So what are you saying here? I should shave again, get some wine, what?
Well, you might want to rethink dirty underwear.
It's basically the first time she's going to see your underwear - do you want it to be dirty?
No.
Oh, and uh, the softener?
Ok, ok, now what's wrong with my
Here.

Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
It is the rule.
Which rule? There is no rule, if you have a table!
How did you get to that?
Well, I think the furniture was good until your little adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Did you know about it?
Well, let's just say that the impressions you made in the butter left little imagination.
Ok, ok, if we shared it?
What do you mean, for example, buy it together?
Yeah
Do you think we are ready for something like this?
Why not?
Well, it's a very big commitment, I mean, what happens if one of us wants to leave?
Why are you moving?
I do not move.
You would tell me if you move well
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip ...
Aw, I know everything about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, then he ran away and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, do not do that

Oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Oh no, stay here, we'll continue to do that. I will pay you.
No, I already had trouble for that. I will see you later.
Absolutely. I like the way you kiss.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I am really sorry!
Aw forget that, it comes from
Do you think you can hit my daughter without marrying her ?! I'm going to kill you!!
You know it's not really the right time for me.

Okay! So, we will stay married.
Yes exactly!
And I'll make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Wow! It's so amazing. I really thought I should tell you more about it.
Ok, see now, I'm scared because I do not really think you're joking.
I'm not kidding. Look, I can not have
What then are we going to stay married forever ?!
Ok, look, how are you going to affect you?
Really?
I mean you fill out a form from time to time and instead of ticking the box that says Ms, you check the box that says Mrs.!
His
Oh, all right, I'm sorry.
You are right.
You know what?
We can absolutely stay married, because I felt that the boxes were far
I ask you to do me a favor.
You ask me to be your wife!
And as a woman, I think you should give me that favor.

Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.
I guess I should have understood when she started going to the dentist four to five times a week.
I mean, how clean can the teeth be?
My brother is experiencing that right now, he's really messy. How did you manage to do it?
Well, you could try to accidentally break something precious that is hers, she said -
-leg?
It's a way! I went to get the watch.
You broke his watch?
Ooh, get away from you.
It is true.
Barry, I'm sorry ...
I am really sorry...
I know you probably think that's all I said the other day about the love you wear with your socks, but it's not ... it's not that, it's about me, and I ... Hi, cut to the machine me again ... anyway ...

Not really, honey, it's really good, come with Susan.
Really, no, I think the girls' party is a great idea.
Okay, okay, goodbye
So what are they doing?
I do not know, something little girl.
Hey, you're early.
What are you doing with the lamp?
I just take to be re-wired.
Oh, well, do not take it to the same place you took the stereo, because they have this thing for over a week.
No, no, Mr. Heckles, no one is making noise here.
You disturb my oboe practice.
You do not play oboe!
I could play oboe!
Ohhh! It's so nice!
Okay, listen, I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's so difficult. I mean, I see you walking and I just want to touch you and hold you in my arms.
Okay, that's it! Let her go!
What is going on?
What is going on?! That's what happens !!
Ross!
It's been twenty minutes since I was in your store trying to get a tie!
What should I do to get a service ?!
Hi Rach.

Ross?
Yeah?
Hey it's Mona! Marriage.
Oh hi!
Hi!
Wow! Uh how are you?
I'm fine except you still owe me a dance.
Oh that's right. Well, would you like to see a Ukrainian movie?
Oh you are serious. Sure!
Awesome! Well, um
I think I might need another cup of coffee.
Sure! Uh, let me take it for you.
Okay.

Look, I feel really bad about the way I panicked you before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
Go!
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
I can play crazy from time to time, but I'm a little more than a pretty blonde girl with a donkey that does not stop.
I think it belongs to your baby's father.
Oh my God Oh, he's here now?
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go and rip the Band-Aid. What do you want to do?
Uh, let's rip!
Really? Are you sure?
Oh Phoebe!
OK sorry. Yeah.
Hi Rachel.

Hey, thank you very much for these notes, Chandler.
Oh well, it was a very important experience for me and I wanted to share it with you.
Oh, you are so wonderful.
Why do not you like me! Chapter One: My First Period
I can not believe you bought this, enjoy your slow death.
I think there are people who have sex.
It can not be me, I'm right here.
Do you want to take a look?
No!
Come on!
You know what? I do not love you without mom. Come on.
We are not stealthily?
Well, I'm sneaking. Oh my God!
Hello sir, you know Monica.

Chandler is fantastic !!
What?!
Oh my God, we just clicked!
Do you know how people click?
As if he had come for me, and I opened the door, and it was like, click!
Did he tell you?
Oh, I ....
Oh, and he has such a good heart! Does not he have a good heart?
Oh, I know ...
Oh, I know and he's so nice! Listen, he said he was going to call, so let him go.
Is not it great ?!
Do not spoil it.

Hi.
Hello Darling!
Hello.
Hi Ross
Yeah, huh.
I have bad news.
What?
I can eat a piece quickly, but then I have to come back here.
Come on darling! You have to work late every night for two weeks, what is it this time?
In fact, it's my fault. I'm leaving today.
But work comes first! Oh, but it's sad for you, what happened? Burnout? Burn everything, huh?
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Oh, that's great, so I guess it's ah, it's goodbye then. Huh? Goodbye.
OK then.
Okay.
We will miss you here.
Yeah me too.
So, on Saturday.
Yeah, you bet.

Whazzup ??
Seriously guy, 3 years ago.
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'll be outside today.
Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between Molly and him?
You do not trust him?

I think the recording is like that.
Ahh
Monica copes, Chandler is against marriage. And always will be!
Well, there are people who want to marry me.
There is?
Yeah! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wanted to marry you ?! And - and Chandler tells you how he hates marriage ?!
It is true.
Chandler
You just told me he hates marriage!
That's it's a complex-type that is unlikely to take a woman!
That he is against marriage and will always be!
You have

You know you probably did not know, but in high school I had a big crush on you.
I knew.
You did it! Oh ... I always thought you thought I was Monica's big brother geek.
I did.
Oh.
Listen, do you think - and try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor here - but do you think it would be nice if I asked you out?
One day?
May be?
Yeah maybe ...
Okay ... okay, maybe I'll ...

Why?
Well, I thought it would be good for me to do something good for my friend.
Well, you are amazing.
Oh no-no-no.
A TV as if it came from nowhere! This is the dream! Dude, how can you afford that?
Well, you know, I'm 29 years old. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends of all time.
Oh, I do not know.
Oh no no no no, you are!
You do that, you give me good advice, and listen, I thought about what you said yesterday about focusing on a woman, I'm going to do it
You mean with Casey.
No, no, I think I'll see how things go with Kathy. She is pretty cool.
Or Casey.
No, no, Kathy.
It could be Casey.
No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
Do you know what I think?
I think someone has a little crush on Casey.
How am I going to arrange both?
What do you think?
May all the pieces of my life fall into place!

Hey, does anyone have a rope length about six feet long with a little wee in the end?
Honey, what's the problem?
I just saw Janice.
Because every time I see your face, I can not help falling into disgrace. I know.....
Wow! This girl is good
Oh-ho, yes! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I had never thought of it before.
I like it.
Why? Because she can sing and play the guitar and do both at the same time?
Well, that's about all I'm looking for from these people.
Look at you. All jealous
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you have a completely different style. You know, she's more .. you know, and you're more
next to meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Ok, see, see, everyone is happy it's over.
Okay, my next song is called Phoebe Buffay, what can I say?
I really loved when we sang partners and I should not have left you that way.
Oh no, one of these songs is "looking for the hidden meaning".

Yes hello.
I have a question.
Uh, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Thank you.
No,
What?! What else did he say?
Uh, he said he thought I was funny.
So, all right, look, go down, we'll have fun, and you'll forget everything.
Ross, no! There is
Oh, come on! Rachel, it's not so bad.
Ross, I'm a human scribble !!
Look, it's not because an idiot has drawn on your face that you must not have fun!
Okay?
And by the way, hey-hey, no one is even going
Okay, there was

Come on!
Oh, wait, you do not have to pay for that, busty ladies?
No it's OK. A child asked me to take it for him, but I do not do it
Oh yes? Okay.
Okay.
But! You do not have to give him back his money?
Uh-huh. Hey, here's my friend. Sorry, no porn for you. Ok, let's go see Monica!

Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, do you want to come for a lemonade?
So?!
Whoa, ah! Are we just going to have some lemonade?
Yeah huh !! Cover up!
Oh, okay.
I do not believe it! When someone asks you for lemonade and that means he wants to have sex?
Well usually ... yeah!
Not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just thought you liked me.
I'm stupid.
It's okay. I guess it could happen to anyone, not everyone I know, but ... By the way, I can still see it.

Hmmm ... it's so nice.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as ... rather than a general question ...
OKAY.
OKAY. Here you are. It's been a while since I wanted to, uh ...
Ohhh !!!!
Yes Yes it is true ...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
I did not mean
Why not?
It's brilliant!
Goodbye Mike, see you at the wedding, guys!
well, we will probably not invite you to the wedding ...
Thank you, Chandler.
Cordially.
Well, nothing! Happy to have been able to help.
How do you think I should propose?
David, I'm pretending

Ok, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can not win if you do not ask
What?!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
We've been on the road for six hours and you've been sleeping for five and a half hours!
We go to the next rest stop and
Okay. Okay.
Yeah! And until then, you will sing because the radio is broken and you are selfish but you have a beautiful voice.
Really? I do not
Sing!!
Dude, it's a long journey! Are my eyes open? No!
Morning!

Everything was delicious!
Thank you!
It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Thank you! You did not say anything ...
In fact, I have a little complaint.
Oh, please! I welcome the critics.
The musician right in front of the restaurant ... it's a kind of good mood!
Which musician?

We were doing?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, here's your traditional Thanksgiving feast, your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin and your family-size Funyuns bag.
Wait, wait, Chandler, that's what you want for Thanksgiving dinner?
What, what, what's with you and these holidays?
Okay, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
We have just finished this wonderful Thanksgiving dinner.
I have - and I remember it very well - a sip of pumpkin pie, and that's when my parents choose to tell me they're going to divorce.
Oh my God.
Yes. It's very difficult to enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it upside down.

Hey, who is this little naked guy?
This little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yes, yes, it's my penis. Can we be adults now?
Who are these people?
Had me.
Oh, it's Nana, right in the middle. "Me and the gang at Java Joe's".
Wow, Monica, you look like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Let's see, 1939 ... yes, 24, 25?
It looks like a funny gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! Monica is naked!
No, it would be me again. I am trying something.

So what is it?
Rachel has something she wants to tell you and um, I think it's your red sweater.
No, it's my red sweater.
Oh no. Can I give someone a coffee or a poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
What's going on Rach?
Nothing! Phoebe was a little mistaken. But you know that you wear this sweater often, are you involved in a kind of challenge?
You know, I'm really glad Phoebe called.
I know we broke up because you thought I was not mature enough, but I really grew up and I think we should get back together.
Oh, it's just not the right time.
It is the right time.
Okay.
'Kay!
in the Favorite Return Character category, the nominees are: John Wheeler of
What is it?

Yeah.
You are an Aquarius, huh?
I bet you are a Gemini.
Nope.
Taurus?
Nope.
Virgin?
Nope.
Sagittarius?
Yes.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh.
Well I tell you what
Yeah?
You're not going to accelerate anymore, right?
I will not speed up.
And you promise that you'll take care of it right away?
I promise.
And in the meantime, you'd better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Yeah!
Can he handle the stick?
never mind
I can handle the stick !!

Hey!
Hey!
Hi.
Oh hi.
I can not believe it takes so long. How are you?
Oh, not bad. Do you know this feeling when you are trying to blow up a St. Bernard?
The weirdest thing. Have I heard - Mother of God, that's right!
Chandler Bing!
Jan-Janice!
Not just Janice, Janice in work, outsourcing and everything.
Oh, it should be easy. I have a very large pool. You remember Chandler.
Janice I did not even know you were pregnant! Who is the involuntary man who is the essence that you stole?
It's you. This is yours.
What?!
Look how nervous he is! We have not slept together for years!
Now that's funny. Does it hurt? Does the job hurt?

Dude, I'm starving! What did I think about dinner ?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
You know, you know, I look and I do not think anyone is at home here.
I say we just broke the window, crawling through, and-and you know how to explain later.
Yeah? Really? Nobody is at home?
I do not think so. Hello? When you enter

Hey whats up?
I just saw Danny take the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, everything is your fault! You got involved in our relationship !!
You do not have a relationship !!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going as planned!
Oh my God, stop with the plan!
So what, then what did you see with a girl?
We do not care?!
It does not mean anything!
Now, look, you're going out with Danny and you're going to be so charming that he's going to forget the stupid subway girl.
She was a little stupid.
You are right.
Okay, I'll just go on the date.
I will go on the date.
This is the new plan.
Come on hurry up!

Hi.
Phoebe!
Ta-da.
Hey.
Hi.
Ahh, look at you, you are beautiful.
Do I? Thanks you too.
Thank you.
Sparkling.
So, wow, it's pretty futile, huh.
Mr. Major Capades.
I remember when you were King King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
You always said that I would do it.
Yeah, well, you know, I'm a little scary like that. Wooo.
I missed you. I'm going to change.
OKAY.
Uh, now. Phoebs.
Oh, all right, all right. Ole.
What?
Uh, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.

Hi Joey, this is Jane Rogers, I can not wait for your party tonight.
Listen, I forgot your address, can you call me?
Thank you, hello.
Hey!
Hey!
What is happening'?
Yeah, it's a shame that you can not attend this one-woman show tonight.
Oh, I'd love to, but I have to get up so early the next day and then, you know me, work first
Oh yes, yes, yes ...
"Hi Joey, this is Jane Rogers looking forward to your party tonight"
Stupid Jane Rogers !!
You have a party tonight ??
A little ... something for the people of Days Of Our Life.
And you were not going to tell us? How did you think you were going to get by?
I do it every year.
Do you do this every year ??
I did not have to tell you that !! I am dumber than Jane Rogers !!
Oh, that's why you got these tickets for this room, to get rid of us?
Yeah...
And last year, is that why you sent us to this medieval restaurant?
Yeah...
OH! And the year before, when did you organize this nocturnal tour of this button factory?

Who is it?
Oh, it's Ross.
Oh ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Recalled what?
It was like months ago.
We passed by this antique store and I saw this pin at the window and told him that it was as if my grandmother had one when I was a little girl.
Oh!
I can not believe he remembered it!
Oh, it's so pretty. It must have cost him a fortune.
I can not believe he did that.
Come on, Ross? Do you remember in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought him that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
F-hah .... Flennin ....
Oh my God.

I really like to wake up with you.
I like to wake up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
That would be great!
We could have breakfast in bed
Wait, just a second.
Okay. Oh! Oh no.

It was depressing, I think I just bought a pretzel from one of the children of
Um-hmm. Oh, wait! It's Bonnie.
Hi!
Is it Bonnie? Is it Bonnie? Are you Bonnie?
Can I show you an ID if you want?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you're very different from the last time I saw you.
Oh yes, well, I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.
Well, I hope you'll have fun tonight.
Thank you! You too.
I believe him.
No you do not do it.
Yes.
No, you know what, you're not going to make me suck.
Oh, of course, because you always have to be right.
I do not always have to agree, okay.
Jurassic Park

I tell you something is wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the garbage chute.
Ross could not get into the chute.
That's right, he could almost. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Hey!
Here it is!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been? !!
Just, you know how to go out.
Oh, outside, oh my God, I do not know why we did not think to check there!
What were you doing?
I went to a bar. And then I just uh, I just walked for a while.
Did you walk all night in the city on your own?
He plugged in! He met someone.
Look, I do not have to answer your questions! Okay? I am a big boy, I can do what I want!
He plugged in !! Tell us about her!
Ross, you left your scarf in Hey, guys.

Okay.
Oh yes, it looks good.
You make a
Yes, we are beautiful together.
Yes we
Okay.
Wow! Imagine what our children could look like!
You know, we do not have to imagine.
I marry her.
We will just see.

Hey! Hey! Watch out for my Porsche!
Hi Joey.
Hey! How are you'?
He has the most incredible Porsche under there!
I'd love to show you, but I just hid it.
She sleeps.
Hey, would you like a drink, two girls?

Well, the old lady is dead.
And how do I know?
His last wish was a last kiss.
But I do not care, because you have the apartment.
Yes!
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I will stay here.
Is not it great?
Ezels !!

Smelly, smelly cat, what do they feed you? Smelly cat, smelly, it's not your fault.
Wow this is great.
Oh yes!
You know you could totally sell that. It would be perfect for a campaign like Kumy.
I ..., a jingle? No no no no no.
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Ok, well, if I was in the loop for the money, I would be a millionaire already, you know.
You just have to get out of this nice head.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I am sorry.
Its good. Okay, I'm going to play a really sad song. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.

Ok sir, um-mm, let's see if I understood correctly.
Ah, so it's a half-coffee, double height, easy hazelnut, no fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot milk coffee, no?
Okay! Great.
You panic.
Thank you.
Uh, coffee to go, please.
Isabella Rosselini.
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Heck! I can not believe I removed it from my list.
Why? Because if you do not go there?
Yeah maybe.
Oh-oh, you're lying.
What do not you think I would go to her?
Ross, you took ten years to admit that you liked me.
Yeah, mademoiselle, you'd better be happy that this list is plasticized.
You know what darling, go ahead, we'll call her a substitute.
Ok, hold my robot.
Okay.
Rachel, are you really going to let him do that?
Honey, he's about to go after Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we do not have popcorn.
Ok, that's enough.
'....
Do not you want to dance with me?
A-ha !!!

Oh-oh-oh, yes! That's right, you take good care of these babies!
Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!
I know you?
Joey!
Oh-ho, yeah. Yes, the guy's hand.
Ok, that's right.
Okay.
Well!
Choose one.
Left! Thank you.
You are welcome.
Ross!
Joey! We should simply change.
Yes absolutely!
Yeah.

Rachel, we're sorry for pushing these guys on you.
Oh that's good!
You know, I had a great time.
You know, the charity was a great success and they raised a lot of money and sensitized.
So what was it for?
I mean an illness.
Hey!
Hey!
I just got this really strange Ross message. He said turn on
Huh. Okay.
Oh my God, look! It's Elisabeth!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Ahh, to be 13 years old again.
Yeah.

Hey! So, uh, was he excited about the tickets?
No! He cut our breath!
What?!
I know!
I can not believe. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
You know what? He did not want to talk about anger, well maybe we do not talk to him
Ooooh! Freeze it.
It is true!
I love it!
Door handle?
Yeah, it pushes a little on you. In fact, I wanted to finish talking to you about spring break.
Oh good.
Look, I'm watching, I'm having a good time with you and I just do not want to go too fast or have a lot of pressure
So, I'm sorry, I just do not think we should leave together again
It's too early.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I said. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a few weeks.
No, I think you misunderstood what
You are so adorable.
This! Let's talk about that.

Hey!
How do you feel?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Okay, so I
And protected them from a tornado?
Oh my God.
I know, babies are asleep.
Phoebe, what, what happened here ?!
I did it! I took care of babies alone!
But my apartment!
Was the setting for Phoebe's triumph.
But the bazaar!
Is not that as important as the fact that Phoebe looked after the babies all by herself.
You're right, you're right, I should not panic.
Because that's what will happen when you and I have babies!
When will it happen?
!
Phoebe, would you like to take a look at this mess !!!!

Hey!
Hey Ross! The baby kicks!
What?! It is?!
It's not a kick right now. Although we would like to see you again.
Hey, when-when did it work? What happened?
Last night! I just felt it and I went to Joey's room and he was sleeping
A sleep without dreams.

So come on, guys, tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is always that you throw Barry to the altar!
Well. Let's talk about reality for a second.
Okay.
When do you come home?
What? Guys, I'm not.
Come on, it's us.
I'm not! That's what I'm doing now. I have this job-
Waitress?
Ok, I'm not just a waitress.
I am..
I, uh ...
I write promotions on the promotions board, and, uh ... and me, uh ...
I take out the dead flowers of the vase ... Oh, and sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate biscuits on the biscuits.

We go down around midnight, why not pick you up then?
So, will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring.
Oh my God.
You see, cleaning works!
They are nice.
Oh, they are firefighters.

Your son.
No no no. I do not have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie's house.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
J? I understood.
J? I understood.
J? have understood! Hey, you sleep with her, I have cramps.
No, you do not do it.
Okay, that's it. I want you both out.
Why?
He started it!
No, you started it.
You did it!
I do not care. I'm trying to get someone out of my body here, and you're not making things easy.
But...
Go ahead!
Thank you so much.
See what you did.
Yeah, listen ...
Outside

Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Do you want to sleep with me tonight? Why? What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such a good service at the Maurice café.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hello.
Uh, could you please tell Sergei that uh, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in The New York Times.
You did not say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering ...
Okay, ah, before you get all your talk, um, could you also tell Sergei that I really like his costume.
Hey, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you're very pretty tonight, your hair golden like the sun.
So you are a chef?
I am also thinking of opening my own restaurant.
Oh really.
Monica, I can talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Well, I had a conversation.
Yes, but Mischa is so interested in you that Sergei and I could not say two words.
What do you want me to do? Sit in silence while you have a conversation?
That would be great. Thank you.

then we finally arrive at the top of the mountain and airhead forgets the camera here!
Oh, you know the same thing happened to me once.
When did this happen to you ?!
Do not you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw this beautiful bird and we wanted to take a picture, I did not have my camera!
Oh yes. First of all, chasing Churo's guy does not jog.
Oh, it's so good you have to try it.
Oh fuck! I got it on my pants.
Here, I'm going to get it.
We'd better take off those pants at the top or that task will be fixed.
Yes. I will take them to our meeting tonight.
Oh great!
Okay goodbye! Oh my God!!
It was amazing!
Okay, see? I told you!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
I do not think they are brother and sister.
They are brother and sister !!!

Action!
I found the picture!
What picture?!
The picture of my wife! In your bag!
You crossed my personal property?
Why a picture of Paulette in your bag ?!
Because Vincent, we were in love. During two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yeah?
Oh you are awesome! And in this last speech? You soaked me.
Thank you so much.
Here is your call sheet for tomorrow.
I know.

So, Chandler, your parents must have been delighted when you told them you were engaged.
Oh yes, I should probably call them.
I remember when we got engaged.
Oh, I do not think I've ever heard this story.
Oh dad, you really do not need to
Well, I put Judy pregnant. I still do not know how it happened.
You do not know how it happened ?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a beautiful story.
Well, at least you do not hear it for the first time at your fifth-grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Anyway, we are very excited about our wedding plans and I think very soon we will make a big withdrawal from Monica's wedding fund.
What?
You tell him Jack, I can not do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund, do not you?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.

After applying the strips of wax and linen on the number one leg,
Do it!
Grab one of the flax strips with its easy-to-grasp tab and pull it out quickly and painlessly.
Okay. Ow !!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was not it painless?
No, it was painful. Oh my God, they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Uh, well, satin girls do not seem to think that's so bad.
It's because their nerves are probably dead with stupidity.
But hey, you know, if you do not believe me, by my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Are you glad we did not start with the bikini bands?

Now, remember that you have to imagine me in a kilt.
I can imagine you in a plaid skirt and short socks.
Do you want to start telling secrets?
No!
Now, remember that I'm still learning.
One two three four!
You know the song! Sung!
So?
No!

Oh my God! It's David!
David who?
David the scientist, David whom I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Oh my God!
Oh, you say someone's name is enough, they turn around.
Phoebe?
David! What are you doing here? Are not you supposed to be in Russia?
Yeah, I'm right, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm,
Well yeah. You are beautiful too. Did you have a haircut?
Yeah. Well, I have like thirty.
Yeah.
Yes! Santa Claus is coming!

Hey, uh, I'm really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
It's not a big deal. Hey, you know, you do what you have to do. Right?
But hey, it's not just me, I'm talking about scientists and tour guides
It does not matter.
It's like that everywhere, Joey!
Ok, Mono, support me here.
Where do you work, servers eat with servers, right?
And the chefs are eating with the other chefs, right?
I eat alone in the alley because everyone hates me.
Listen, Ross, really, it does not matter.
You're wearing a white coat, I'm wearing a blue blazer, if that means we can not be friends at work, so be it.
You know, hey I understand.
You know?
Hey, when I play in a room and you're in the audience, I'm not talking to you, are you?
So it's you, it's cool.
I will see you tomorrow.
Yes, when we are in the audience, he does not speak to us, but he signals.

You looked like an idiot.
Hey, I was not the only one to look like an idiot.
Okay?
Do you remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"
And he came out, "Buat Squatternut?"
Yes it's the same.
That's all. It's my worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, wait! It's not the one Rachel is talking about. She did not even know it had happened. So what was it?
Which?
Umm, I-I really do not want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, relive the pain and be depressed, that's what Thanksgiving is all about.
You know, for me anyway.
And of course, the Indians.
Look, uh, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!

Hi guys.
Hi! Phoebe
Hi Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologize if I-you know seemed a little upset yesterday at my shower. You know it's just hormones, you know.
No U.S
Hormones.
hormones, yes.
Your parents'?
Yes, they are out of town.
Ohh
Yeah yeah that's it
Yes it works.
They-they-they can feel the fear.

Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Honey, do you remember my boss, Doug, do you?
Yes hello
Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this MA
I did not know you and Carol had just got divorced, I'm sorry.
Sorry? Finally chew my leg out of this bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
No leg pain for us sir.
Oh, give the time.
So, divorce, marriage, we have a lot to celebrate.
What if we went out for dinner tomorrow night?
I can not think of anything we do. Why can not I think of anything we do?
Tomorrow night, then, I should be out of court at six o'clock.
They keep throwing me these cases of sexual harassment and I get them out of the park!
Okay, see you tomorrow!
Just so you know, we will not see him tomorrow.
I-I can not spend another night with this man.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
No.
This is because he was not invited because of the way he behaved during our engagement party.
Oh yes. Boy cuts urine

Now, maybe you want all the duck to be here! Who cares, you know? Now I have legs
How many times have I told you guys, you
Hi Chandler.
Hey!
Uh, listen, I need the dripping pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Oh, it was yours? Uh, yes, we used it when the duck vomited caterpillars.
William Sonoma
Expect that in 4-6 weeks.
Uh, uh, uh, Joey will be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have plenty of room for us alone.
Yes so?
Well, I thought you might want to spend time with the best you've ever had.
You know what, champion? I think I will pass.
Why?
Why?
What are you talking about?

So, what's your name?
It's Jake.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Yes, big fan.
Me too! There is a match on Tuesday, do you want to go?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.

Ugh. Ross!
Hi! Please excuse my delay. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo !!
Oh great!
Look, I had to find you a new battery.
I got you the best I could, because that's not where you want to skimp.
You're a genius, Ross.
Yeah, well, it cost about $ 112, but damn it, just 110 pairs?
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay goodbye !!
So, ah, they all took off, it was hard enough to watch them go, see?
Yeah, all right, goodbye.
So I will leave then!

Hey! Oh yes, tonight was your party.
Oh wow, you are beautiful! Glad you can do it.
Oh, you know, the gala had to end now and then.
Do not go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yes of course. Okay, what pitch is the ball now?
I thought there was no bullet?
Oh, come on! He's glad I came, he does not want me anywhere, bullets flying everywhere!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom.
Oh, keep going! Do you talk to me about people?
You two could really hear you! I will mingle.
So you work at
Yeah, all right, feel good about it!
I am sorry?
No, everything is fine, you can just drop the Tommy act.
I know what's going on here.
The winger of your Danny is not it?
You are the best buds.
Frat bros!
I will talk to a friend.
Yeah, yeah, you're going to talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Man! He does not stop lobing them and I can not stop knocking them out of the park!
I think I need a drink.
Yeah!

Hey, Pheebs?
No, I can not talk to you! I do not have an ad in the yellow pages!
Look, Pheebs, I just want to apologize for saying that your method was stupid and maybe ask you to become my teacher again.
And-and I promise you I will not touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
Do you really think I'm ready?
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!
Was the rope at least fair
No!

Well, it has been fun.
Yes. Yes, thank you for letting me use your phone ... and save my life.
Goodbye Chandler. I had a big blackout. See you.
Hi, I'm the number 7143457.
And, uh, I do not know if you have anything, but I'd really like a copy of the tape.

We are starting to see a lot of layers of fabrics and colors. For example, a navy blouse on a rose ....
I'm really glad we came. You are so cute. I love you.
Ok, it's a fire. Oh yes. Oh yes.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'll have to remind you, I have a Schemp in my office.
What are you doing?
I am sorry.
But uh, hey, oh, someone hung up on the phone. Why a glass of wine by the fire, I could turn it on again.
Ross, you do not listen to me, I do not have time to stop.
Come on Rachel, you do not have what, ten minutes?
I do not have ten minutes !!
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross !!! I told you no!
Do not scream at me, it's the maximum I've seen you all week.
Look, I can not do that now, okay, I have a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Yes, but wait ...
Goodbye!
In fact, it's our three-hole punch.

Oh yes? When?
Okay.
I will tell you what.
When we are 40, if neither of us are married, what do you say, you and I, we meet and have one?
Why will not I be married when I'm 40?
Oh no no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why will not I be married at 40?
No no no.
What is it? Is there anything fundamentally implausible about me?
uh
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a backpack!
Hey.
Hey. Ooh, look at yourself, dressed.
Have you gone home and changed?
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I want to look good. Uh, has Dr. Franzblau gone?
No I have not seen it.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. And if the baby needs him?
Rachel, what's going on between you and the doctors? Was your father a doctor?
Yeah why?
Without reason.

I am the armadillo of the holidays! I am a friend of Santa Claus and he sent me here to wish you a merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Okay, I'll do it just this time! But you can not tell anyone!
Yes! Yes! Please, give it to me!
Yes it's her.
Thank you.
It's incredible! I can not believe this panel did not work!
Do you know what would work?
Hmm?
Stop making sweets!
But they like that!
You mean they love you.
May be.
Is that why you became a chef? For people to love you?
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to love you, huh, funny man?

We were on the platform, ready to dance the world in the new millennium, and the guy shouted "CUT!
Uh, wait, so you tell me you've been doing the routine since eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course, we had to update it a bit. Hey, by the way, it's great to think of catching me!
'Because I was going to say there was no way to make the end as you did at the time!
What? We could do it!
I do not know, I mean you were much bigger, I mean, stronger at the time.
I can do it, okay? Let's go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can not do it!
Now you do that, you're on TV.

Hey!
So, what are you on the market for? We have scarves, postcards of tulips ...
Look at this? Huh? Yeah. That's the thing. What do you think?
Well, I do not have to buy that anymore, a "I'm stupid" t-shirt.
Well, I like that. Here you are.
Well, listen, you're not really going to buy what you are? Do not you think you embarrassed me enough for a day?
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer that when I pretend not to know you?
He is just jealous. You will adapt well; all Londoners wear them!
Oh really? So how come nobody here wears them?
They are all tourists.
Look, if you want to wear this in public, you'll spend the rest of the afternoon.
Oh yes? If you want me to choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Good choice.
Thank you.
OK wait. Okay, that's all, okay, I'm getting out of here. I will not be embarrassed anymore!

So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What?
You know, I do not read as many important books as you do, and I do not write complicated poems that seem to concern one thing but actually concern something else.
And you know what, I'm excited about stupid things, like when I
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You do not even know me ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem does not concern you.
What?
The empty vase does not concern you. My baby, you make me so sad that you think that.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe ...
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Oh yes.

Ok, forward. Forward-Stop! Ok, back-stop! Ok, advance-stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross, forget that. This guy totally stuck you.
Is this yours?
Well actually
No no no! It's mine! It's mine.
Dude, you need this car so badly.
Okay.
Ok, here's what we will do.
Ok, I'll break into this minivan and put it in neutral.
You're pushing guys so Ross can leave.
Okay?
Okay, let's go.
Carry the ass !!!
!

Thus, it was said that by 2030 there would be computers capable of performing the same number of functions as a real human brain.
So, theoretically, we could download our thoughts and memories into this computer ...
... and live forever as a machine!
So it's Janine, do you know-what-you know we're doing now?
You and I interfere.
Yes, I have to go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!

David, can you help me ?! I try to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Oh, definitely. It is a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
See?
Yeah, it comes down to "it has something to do with the wind".
Well, I'll go get some stuff for the trip.
Oh, I should go too.
Oh, now ... tomorrow, do you want to share a taxi for the airport or if Mike and I meet there?
Oh ... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he'll be there.
And she was like, "Oh, do not worry!
I asked him.
He totally agrees to see you! ".
So now, I have to go, so he'll think I totally agree to see him!
What you are not, because you have totally hung up!
Exactly!
And you want him to eat his heart so that you have to have a fabulous look!
I did not even think about that! Aaargh,
Hey Pheebs, I'm going to take Charlie to the shops, why do not you come and I'll help you find something.
Ok, it'll be great!
Oh, that's not nice? You three, try slutty lingerie together.
This is not what we are going to do!
Why would you ruin him, who was this wounded?

Julie hello! Chandler Bing, I guess you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.
It's a nickname, I'll explain to you later.
It's pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long-awaited apology. I should never have broken up with you because you were overweight.
That's why you broke up with me?
You do not know it. Well, I guess my job here is over!

Ni-chou chi-ma!
Ross! Excuse me, forgive me, excuse me ...
Hi everybody.
I just wanted to thank you for our discussion before.
Oh, my God, no problem. So are you going to go with the wait?
I was fine, but after talking to you, I talked to Joey.
What did he say?
Basically, he told me to overtake and do it, you know.
So, I thought about what you said and what he said and, well, his way of making love tonight.
.
.

Oh great!
You could not forget your eyes all night, then from time to time he would bend down to stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Ok, stop Phoebe, you make me all sparkle.
All I could think of was, "Will he kiss me, will he kiss me?"
And did he do it?
I am a woman Monica, I do not kiss and do not tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay, okay, I have it. J? I understood.
I love him so much that I feel that I have drunk 10 glasses today and that I have only taken six.
Oh, I have not had that feeling since I started dating Chandler.
Wow, I'll never have that feeling again, will I?
You talk like a guy.
No, a guy would say, "I will never sleep with anyone else."
Oh my God!
I will never sleep with anyone else!
I was so busy planning the wedding that I forgot all the things I would give up!
I mean, I will never have a first kiss again.
You'll have a last kiss.

Thank you very much for coming back.
Oh, you're here. Yes, and I was afraid it would be uncomfortable.
I know Mona, listen to me.
First of all, I'm really sorry that my father is screaming at you, but I heard you hold on.
You'll have to tell me how you did that.
Focus.
Okay. Uh, but ok, yes, Ross and I had a date with someone. And yes, we are going to have a baby. But we are
Okay, where is this turkey!
Joey! These are my maternity pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!

No.
No!
Yes!
Ahh
Oh, are you watching this Monica?
I just shoot down all your best scores, what sadness.
Ok, I'm next. Do not! Do not start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
Oh I am sorry. I did not hear about all the winners.
Chandler! Phoebe takes over the game!
Remember that I had to leave the room the other day when you had this roast chicken?
Yeah. But I thought it was because I had put everything on my hand and had it crossed the table.
Anyway, it does not seem worth it to make a whole turkey for only three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
But you must have turkey for Thanksgiving!
I mean, Thanksgiving without a turkey is like July 4th without apple pie!
Or Friday without two pizzas!
Everything is fine! If it matters a lot to you! But just, there will remain a ton.
No, there will not be any! I promise that I will finish this turkey!
Okay, you tell me you can eat a whole turkey in one sitting?
It is true!
Because I am a Tribbiani!
And that's what we do!
I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we do not read a lot or do not run very fast, but damn it!
We can eat!

Well?
Wow! It's enormous! It's so much bigger than the cabin. Oh, it's a cube.
Look at this!
Oh! You have a window!
Yes really! With a beautiful view of ...
Oh look! This guy pee!
Hi.
Hi.

You know what? I can not do that with my left hand! Could you please, help me with that too?
Ohh
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Okay. This kind of things?
Yeah.
Okay.
Careful. Light. Ok, do you know how, just sweep the lid. Okay? Just sweep.
Oke-Dokey.

Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, technically, it's not a zoo as such, but rather an interactive wildlife experience.
Let me ask you some questions about, is it Marcel?
Yes.
Does he fight with other animals?
No, no, he is very docile.
Even if he was ... stuck?
Well, I do not know. Why?
Uh, how does he handle small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's what it means ...
How about a hammer or a small blade?
Why, why, why would he need a blade?
Well, if he's against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you have to give something to the little guy.
Otherwise it's just cruel.
He came in, he went to San Diego.
We came back from our walk and the phone was ringing ...
...He is in.
He is in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You make a big mistake here.
I mean, San Diego is fine, but if you give it to me, I will start it against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the winnings.

My sample is in the room and I just want to thank anyone who knocked on the door while I was there.
Really helped speed up the process!
Janice!
You're not ... gone?
Oh!
Sid is still in his room.
I do not allow porn at home, so it's like a vacation for him.
So did you do it?
Have you made your deposit?
Yeah! yes ... the hard part is over!
This is not the difficult part darling! The hard part is what comes next, I mean, are not you worried about the results?
I have not ... I have not even thought about the results yet ... I just assumed everything would be fine.
Oh! Well, what do you know? It probably is.
Phoebe, where's your bag?
No no! Give it to me!
You can not have it.
Give it to me!
No
I'll go.
Oh yes.
Phoebe come here
Haha!
Damn, Monica Geller, hyphen Bing!

What we did was wrong. Oh my god, I slept with someone who was not alive during the bicentennial.
I just made love.
Ethan, concentrate. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, it's different. My lie did not make one of us a criminal in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I did not think. I was too busy falling ...
Do not say it.
...in love with you.
Really?
Sorry.
Well, forget it.
You know, you should not even be here, it's a school night.
Oh my god, oh my god.
I am like those women you see with bright guys named Chad.
I am Joan Collins.
Who?

That's right, still no baby! Come on! Please make room!
Uh darling, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
You. As if you did not have enough.
Listen, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish I could do something.
I mean I would like to be a hippocampus.
Because with seahorses, it is the male who carries the babies.
And then too, I would be far in the sea.
God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life!
Oh I know, I went there. I remember towards the end
Oh Phoebe, it's a beautiful story.
Can you tell me when you get me iced tea?
Oh my God, come out!
Get out !!
Get out !!
Get out!
!
Let's

Okay, I know! I know. Yeah, it's okay.
Oh my God. What will he do now?
I can not watch!
Oh.
Seriously, how can you look at this?
Are not you afraid?
terrified

Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Um, listen, there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is it you who goes out with the nurse?
Yes, Joey already told me so, and I'm fine.
I mean, you and I are just, you know, we are nothing, we go everywhere.
Uh, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out, but hey, if we laugh, uh, maybe I
Well! Maybe I'll do it too!
Well, it was big enough. I-I-I-I-I-I-I had to throw away most of it.
You, you have thrown my sandwich!
MY SANDWICH? !!!
MY SANDWICH !!!!!!

What's the problem, Pheebs?
She canceled! My namesake canceled on me!
What?!
Yes, she said she had to get out of the city suddenly.
She avoids me, she does not want to tell me where my father is.
She knows and she will not tell me anything.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, well, is not that 'Aww Pheebs, that sucks!' me again.
Where are you going?
Well, she's out of town so there must be something in her house that tells me where my father is.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call it breaking in.
Well, are there people here ?!
Oh my God, me too!
I knew it, wow!
Wait, wait, wait! Cute or ugly puppies?
Oh, so cute.
Uh-huh, well! But uh, I'm still ... I'm mad at you.
I know. I am angry at myself too.
Do you want to eat something? I'm a little hungry.
Hey! Me too!
Okay, stop that. Now, you're just doing it to scare me.

Ok, you can do that.
It's like removing a bandage.
Do it very quickly and the wound will be exposed.
Janice Hi Janice. OK, let's go. I do not think we should go out anymore. Janice
Okay. Well, there it is. Stop, stop, stop.

Oh my God! This guy at the counter is totally watching you!
Really? God, he's really cute.
Dark.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
I'm just saying, get his number just in case.
But no: Chandler is in an accident and can not play sexually and he wants you to take a lover to satisfy the needs he can no longer satisfy
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but hum, I'm engaged.
Well, you should be embarrassed.
I did it, but it was really fun.

Hey.
Chandler. I felt it was you.
What?!
Unagi. I am always aware.
OK, do you know that unagi is an eel?
What's up?
I do not know what to do Monica.
Oh, why do not you give him one of your little jokes.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have something here that looks homemade?
You know what?
She would love that.
Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I did it in sixth grade.
Yes, I guess I could use it. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yeah-yeah, except that Apollo 8 did not land on the moon.
But you, you could write that, uh, your love allows me to twirl around the moon and come back safely.
Wait a minute, I can not give it to him.
Why not?
Because it is written "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Yeah, more.
Hey, thank you very much.
Sensational. Well, I guess it's Cupid who brought her here.
No, just an old flying dwarf.

Oh. Oh, I can not believe Clark supports me!
He could still appear.
Oh, what are you stupid? It's been three hours.
Is that all?
I should just move on to happier things, okay? Why do not you talk about your beautiful marriage?
In fact, there was something we wanted to tell you about marriage.
Uh, it's going to be a small ceremony.
Uh, tiny!
We do not even know why we have it.
In fact, it will only be family.
Oh, wait, do you take me for a family? Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing

Come to me. No-no, you come here for me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, did you bring Joey?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Whoa! What do you know Katie? I must tell you that I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Oh, Joey has the best friends!
Ohh, and the sweetest girlfriend!
You are so nice!
Oh, you are so nice!
Oww !!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.
Well? Are not you going to do something?
uh
You better do something, or I'll go out the door now! Well? Will you?
Nah.

How can you take a hitchhiker ?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
You do not think I asked him that before he came in ?!
You know what? I do not speak to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist ?!
No!
Do you like car games?
Yeah, do you know the license plate game?
I
Ooh, I will play! I will play!
No no! You need your sleep. Night night! Hush!

Pheebs, can you help me choose an engagement ring for Monica?
I can not understand that!
It is so hard!
Should I get her a Tiffany Cup or a Princess Cup or a-ah-ah!
Paper cut!
Now, did you tell anyone else?
No, I do not want to talk to anyone because I do not want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends and you surprised me when I was looking at brochures.
Yeah, again, do not knock is profitable. I only wish you were not in the bathroom.
Me too.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! So Chandler, do you want to go to the cafe?
Ah. Very good.
Yes, a coffee.
Oh, perfect, we were going to see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, we do not do it because we got the other pl place.
So vulgar.
Oh I am sorry. Do you want to bite?

The stripper stole the ring !! The stripper stole the ring !! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What?
The ring is gone!
Ugh.
Just a second, give me a minute to get up for that-ah-ha-ha !!
You lost the ring!
You are the worst man of all time!
Dude, it's not funny!
What will I do?!
I'm going to bed last night, everything is cool!
I wake up this morning, the stripper is gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
Of course!!

What difference does it make?
Well, I'm right-if the dough matches the pants, you can make some pants and it will not know the difference!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I going
Uh, Rachel is here, so good luck, let me know how it goes.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, your timing could not be better. I extinguish fires everywhere.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
What is it, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise not to tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I do not want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you want to know! It's incredible!
I do not care, Rachel! Look, I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can not tell anyone!
What? What secrets? Do you know secrets? What are they?
And you are not supposed to chat !!
I know I know! I just can not keep this one, so I pick up the phone
I'm not listening to you!

Oh! Yay! Look! There is a room that has no floor on it!
Stand by your side!
Hey, come on now!
Okay, what do we have?
Uh, I do not believe in those crazy diets, you know, just everything in moderation.
I will take those to go. For kids.
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were in the show years ago and then they killed you. What happened there?
It was so stupid, I said things in an interview that I should not have said.
But believe me, it's not going to happen today.
Including. So, what did you say at the time?
Well, I said that I

Ha!
So, you like drums!
It's awesome!
You know, I was worried that their life situation would be unbearable.
Okay, okay, apparently not!
So yes!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, listen, we've already learned a song. Ready? One two three four...
Tequila!!
It's funny.

Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Yes! And he said really nasty things that were only partially true.
I'll go and teach this guy a lesson.
Joey, please, do not do that. I think it's better that we do not know it.
It's easy for you to say, you have not been nearly killed.
Okay, the school is in session!
My God! Is it a gym card?
Oh yes, gym member. I try to go there four times a week, but I missed the last 1200 times.
So, why do not you quit?
Do not you think I tried? You think I
Who is maria
Oh Maria. You can not tell him no, she's like that treat covered with lycra and spandex.
Do you need me to go with you there and hold your hand?
No!
So you're strong enough to face him alone?
Oh no, you will have to come.

Thank you.
Thank you. Mon?
Hmm?
Pheebs, I do not think anyone is mad at this.
Exactly! Because it's past!
Someone will eat that?

Pheebs!
Hey!
Listen, you know how, when you wear pants and you lean forward, I check your underwear?
Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it, I saw that he was wearing women's underwear!
I know. They were mine.
Oh. No! No, it's weird!
No it is not! We were just laughing and I challenged him to try them.
It's weird!
I'm wearing her panties right now.
It's a bit hot.
I think so too. And this small part? Ideal to hold my lipstick.
Yes, I would not know.
And! Do you know what Jake says? The underwear of this woman is actually more comfortable. And he likes the feeling of silk on his skin.
Yeah, the next thing you know, he'll tell you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I think even more than you.
Oh yes, he looked like a real woodcutter in those pink pinks.
I'm just saying that only a man completely safe with his masculinity could walk in women's underwear!
I do not think you can ever do that.
Hey! I
OK whatever.
The lusts of the flesh.
What?
I do not know. A cowboy theme?

Hey, will that come?
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I ... she's beautiful I love her!
Yeah, look at Rach, there's something I have to tell you.
Hey!
Hey! Are you ready to try breastfeeding again?
Yeah! Hi emma. Hey, why do not you think she will not take my chest?
Everything is fine, it takes some babies some time to get it, but do not worry. It will happen.
Yowsa!
Ok honey, you can do it. Open it and put it in your mouth.
Dear Lord.
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
Oh, uh, yeah, I think ...
Oh look, she's moving away again!
Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Does not she look scared?
You know, I do not really know her.

Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
No, but do not worry, I'm sure they're still here.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment with Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo".
In fact, tomorrow night, it depends a little bit on how tonight
Oh, listen, about tonight ...
No, no, no, do not dare pay me the deposit.
The only reason she leaves with me is because I said I could bring a friend for his friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend looks like such ...
Pathetic disorder?
I know, but ... come on, man, she needs nothing, she's vulnerable.
I think, cha-ching!
Thank you.
Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
You do that.
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Bravo, man! You still have the egg, huh?

"Happy Birthday!"
You pay for it.
What? No-no, it's his birthday!
You sang Happy birthday to 20 different women today!
But it's really
You are no longer allowed to distribute birthday muffins.
Damn it!
Rachel? Hi!
Hi!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
well yeah
Oh wow!
I mean, wow!
I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I never thought I'd go out with her, ever!
Really?!
Yes, but after you said that everything was fine, I thought, "Why not ?!"
Oh, so not really ever.
I must say that you are a much bigger person than me.
I mean, after all we've gone through, I-I just want to have a brother to reciprocate.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh-ho and mine!

Ok, so no toner today. Thanks anyway, goodbye.
No, no, wait! I can not let you hang up! Tell me please.
Well, I have only one thing to do today. I guess I could push him away.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
It's just that, uh, I've been working for ten years in this meaningless and meaningless work and no one here even knows I exist!
Chandler?
I'm sorry?
No, I'm sure people know you exist!
Oh yes?
I work in a cabin surrounded by people.
It's been five minutes since I told you to kill me and nobody looks up from their desk.
Hang-hang.
Hello everyone!
Uh, I'm going to kill myself!
I will come back to you.
I did not understand.
Expect.
Uh, hey Marge!
Ehh nothing.
Nothing.

Apparently, there are like a million guys who can play on Mac, and there is only this robot and this guy who controls it!
I did not know he could get fired!
What am I going to do?
You know Joey, you're a lovely guy.
Thank you, but I have a problem here.
No darling, you have to conquer the guy who controls C.H.E.E.E.E.E. You have to kiss a serious robot ass!
It's not a bad idea.
Yeah.
Okay, but if I have to activate the charm tomorrow, I'm not wasting it here with you anymore.
Well, actually, I'm a little saved for you, Pheebs.
So you think Joey is more charming than me?
Yeah! That's why I sleep with him on the side.
Yeah, you want.
"You wish."
Why are you shouting?
Whoa, that

Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well, it's an appointment.
An appointment ?!
No, no, Pheebs, you must be wrong, because I know you will not schedule an appointment the same night you have projects with a friend!
Come on Joey, do not hurt me about that.
No, I'm going !!
It is true!
Yes, you made me feel really guilty about going out with this girl!
I like, like, I did you something terrible!
And now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
It's not the same thing! It is
Ok, my daughter the other night was special. She was also a scientist!
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
OK whatever.
You know what?
I do not have time to convince you because he is only there for four hours and I will go see him!
Well!
Yeah!
Well!
Yeah!
What are you still doing here? I told you, lobster ravioli!

Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur ... thing ... anyway.
Hi.
Ross, do you remember Susan?
How could I forget?
Ross.
Hello Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, are we just waiting ...?
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he
She.
"She, of course, does she know our particular situation?
Yes, and she is very supportive.
Ok, that's great. No, I- Oh.
Thank you.
Quack quack..
Ross? That opens my collar.
Barry?
Come in.
Are you sure?
Yeah! It's good, it's good. Robbie will stay here for hours.
Huh ?!
So how are you?
... boy of flames.

Does she use the cups? Yes! I think she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I think she does.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
No, no, let me in!
Phoebe?
Yeah!
Can you wait a minute?
No, you must let me in now !!
Are you alone?
Yes!
Okay.

Let's go there!
No! You loose!
No!
How is it that we always stay on the ground holding the ball?
I do not know. I guess other people do not care enough.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Give me this!
Let's go there!

You know what?
Umm?
I bet I could go.
I have five dollars, you can not.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Simply pull or fall. It is good too.
Fan of Knick?
Oh yes.
Oh, boy, are they afraid?
Hey, listen, madam ....... whoa.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he could not touch the water if he stood on a boat.
Oh yes? And who do you like?
The Celtics.
The Celtics? Ha. They could not hit a boat if ... wait. They are void, okay?
Oh shut up. You know, it's a year of reconstruction. You ... waah!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me go get the father. Hey, we need a father here! We need a father!
There is no father.
Oh, oh, sorry.
Okay that's good. I'm fine. I am ... oh!
Oh okay. This way. All other pregnant women seem to be at home.
Okay.

Honey, just give me another chance, okay, we start again. We will return to Aruba.
Dr. Farber, we have some urgency here ... Jason Costalano is choking on his mandate.
Oh my God...
I'll be there, Bernice.
Listen, please, please do not go anywhere, okay?
I'll be, I'll be back.
Okay.
Ok, we'll be here!
To hate you!
Did you see how he was sweating when he came out of there?
Listen darling, if I squeeze the ball too much, you just jump in and you give me some shots because I tell you, it looks
Yeah ... I'm pretty sure I'll marry her again.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He is Satan in a blouse!
Listen, I know it's not perfect, but the truth is that in the end I still really want to be Mrs. Dr. Farber, D.D.S.
Oh my God.
I hope you can find a way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll always be my bridesmaid ...?
And I hope Barry does not kill you and eat you in Aruba.

Listen, Robert's going to be in a second, so, will any of you just tell him?
Oh.
Please, right now, no, every time I see it, it's like, "Is it to lose?" 'Is he looking at me?'
We can not tell him, you can not go see a guy you barely know and talk about his ... stuff.
He is right, even if it is to say something complementary.
Hey!
Hey.
So are you ready for the gym? They have this new climbing wall, we can identify.
No, I can spot you from here.
What?
Ok, listen Robert ...
I do not have time for that.
No, that's what the game is.
What you just gave up very quickly.
Have you seen Joey?
What's the problem?
Oh, just that! You know what my fault really is, because the couch is usually where we
Hey, does anyone want to give me one of these tiles?
What is going on?
He's coming back to my floor.
Yo !! Spackel Boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you've started this, you're going to finish it.
He started mine first!
Build the Cinderelly unit, place the Cinderelly tile.

Come on Chloe! Finish with your client first. Come on Chloe! Go Chloe !!
Can I help you?
Uh-oh.
Uh, you know what, we have doubts about our copy needs. And we will need a little more time to think about it.
Chloe, exchange with me, there are guys here who have a crush on you.
Ok, it hurt us.
Hi guys. I have not seen you since this morning.
Well, ah ........ you know.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night?
We both?
May be. Does it scare you?
Relax. This is the game of D.J. Issac Philly. You should come.
We'll be there.
Awesome. I'm going ah, see you later.
Okay, keep going.

Uh, candles, champagne, yes birthdays are great.
Because you know that love lasts forever, you know.
Nothing like that in this life, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Oh God, Ross, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well.
You know what, I want to talk to you about it so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get in, are you free for tomorrow night's dinner?
Oh yes, I would love that.
Oh great! Me too.
I guess it all started when Rachel had this new job.

And why do you care so much?
Because! You could live my fantasy!
You had fantasies about Emily?
No! You know,
Is that why in college you were the only one to have attended this Ukrainian child?
Yeah that, besides his mother used to put sour cream on everything!
Ahh
Do you like him?
We said it would only last two weeks, you see?
You like it!
What is love really?
Ohhh I
I am a good kisser.
Then you can, can sneak into the cockpit and things will start to heat up, then a stewardess arrives, I watched too much porn.

So, basically, it's very easy. You read the script and try to sell as much toner as possible.
Ok, I can do it! Oh, by the way, I
Why do not we try it.
Oh ok. Umm, okay. Hello, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I am the procurement manager.
Uh, all right, I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.

Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She does not hear it and continues to run, Chandler begins to chase her as a theme
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Hey!
Okay.

Oh, hey, Monday, do you still have your old school dresses and blouses?
Yes, I think I have some somewhere. Why?
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, Rachel! I made a pile of your belongings on this side of the room. If you could just throw in your purse.
Bloomingdale's
Oh my God, are you unemployed?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Who is just a
Okay!
Come on, no stealth!
Our eyes are closed and we are about to cross the street. Very well.
Okayyyyy, open up!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is
Yes, it's for our caterer!
I think I know this girl.
Okay, we're not really going to keep it that way.
No?
No, we are going to paint the sword and replace it with a wand.
Oh!
And also, we do not know what to do with it.
Oh yes, I really know her.

You do not know? Rachel, you put my girlfriend in the balance!
Okay! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with someone else?
You know, hey! You are the one who finished, remember?
Yes, because I was
You always love me?
Noo
You always love me.
Oh, yes, so, you love me!
Noo, nnnnn. What does it mean? What do you want, I mean, do you want to get back together?
Noo!
May be!
Me, I do not know.
Ross, I still can not forgive you for what you did, I can not, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you, I feel so ...
What?!
I come, I feel, I - I come ...
What?
I feel...
Noo !! I do not care! I will not, I will not play striptease face to face with you to practice!
But I made cards !!
Well! Good night. I ride.
Good night.
Do you want to play strip poker to train?

What are you doing?
The key is stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Wait. Warning. Warning.
It still does not work.
Yes I am sorry. Do you have extra pants? Hmm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.

Is not it incredible ?! Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I know they will be
Ohh, I mean two best friends who fall in love, how often does this happen?
do not
No! I am so happy for them!
Me too! So happy for them!
I am so happy and not at all jealous.
Oh no! No God, certainly not jealous!
I mean, I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean, what is 2%? It's nothing.
Totally. I am like 90/10.
Yeah me too.
Hey, do you guys have Chandler on stage?
But no, but you know who stopped here to pick you up, Tennille.

Do you remember the guy from the cooking school that I told you about this coriander?
Oh, of course, Cilantro Larry.
Well, I'm going to replace him as a food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Wow, Monica! What an incredible opportunity to influence dozens of people.
How can you say yes, what about our catering business?
Oh no-no-no, it's just one night a week, plus I can take you all for a
Yay !!
Oh, in this case - Yay! It was me jumping on board.
Oh.
Hey guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for you. Are you ready to party?
Hello.
Hi it's me.
I know you can not bear staying in the same room as me, so I thought I'd try to apologize over the phone.
Everything I
Hello.
Look, I should never have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm
Stop callin '!!
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $ 1000 daily challenge.
Okay!
What is the name of your roommate who is really sorry and would do anything

Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you already at home? !!
Umm, I think he's still outside. What's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me that word.
"Pheebs, I can not do it, I have an appointment, see you later, Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Oh, it's a nickname we tried.
Hey, do you know what nickname was never retained? The Ross-A-Tron!
Hey!
Oh! This is Joseph Francis!
Oh-Wha-Ho! Why are you calling me in the middle? I left you a word!
So what?! It does not give you the right to let me down!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is a possibility of sex!
Phoebe is right, that's the rule.
I do not accept this rule.
When we do projects, I expect you to come.
Okay, I can not just be a way to save time before meeting someone better!
You know, boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but it's for life!
Did you know he was there?
No.
How long have we been at home?
About half an hour.
Love

Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Ooh good.
So, ah, there was one thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh that's right! I completely forgot about that.
Well, ah, I thought a lot and I look at my life
Yeah?
And I have the impression of having conquered the business world, and I have the impression of having conquered the intellectual world, and now, I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Sensational.
One thing is missing.
What is it?
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Okay.
Monica, I want to become the ultimate champion of the fight.
What do you want?
I want to become the ultimate fighting champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
Okay, my coach, Ho Chi, teaches me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fights. I even designed my own octagon ring.
And I guess you used a ring designer for that.
Yeah.
Monica, I want you in the first row when I win.
I want you to be close enough to feel the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.

Ok to enter?
Yeah, go eat what you want. Dr. Roger was again paged.
Yeah I know, guess who made it beep?
What?!
I am the torn spleen.
Why would you do that?
Because you should not be with him. You should be with me.
Really?
Yeah!
When you talked about Roger, it killed me!
Look, things like last night, it does not happen like that.
You know?
Or at least not to me.
Or with the other two women in the morning, you know I was just lying there and I could not wait to hang out with my friends, but with you, I always know it with a friend.
Chandler!
I know you probably do not want to go out with me, you know, because I make too many jokes and I've never had a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor"
There was only one woman, was not it?
No, there were two.
Including me?
Oh yes.

Hey!
Welcome back!
Hey! Can we continue where we were?
I do not know, I'm still pretty tired of this afternoon.
Why?
Uh, sex.
What sex?
Our sex
We did not have sex.
Well, if I did not sleep with you, I slept with someone who looked a lot like
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Oh my God Stu! I-I can not believe you did that! Now, are you absolutely sure she's a whore?
Either that, or she's the best date, the most expensive I've ever had.

Do you want to watch them. Am I ever going to find a boyfriend? I'm going to die an old girl.
I am your mother
Huh?
Oh, and then Monica joked that she would not go out with a guy like Chandler ...
Hi.
... and he could not give up, and ... I do not really know what happened with that either.
Oh oh!
And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, introduces herself and Rachel convinces her to save her head.
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I do not know what's going on either ...
Wait, let me go get Chandler.

Uh, Mr. Morse, may I speak to you for a moment?
Well yes, I lied before.
Oh!
Oh my God
Now you know what you really think.
Oh-oh, it's a risky little game!
Are you really going to do that?
Yeah. I'm having a baby. I'm having a baby. I'm having a baby!
With whom?
Ah, that's still not the moment.

You said I was boring - Ohh!
When did I say you were boring ?!
Oh my God, I remember it now! We played chess!
Phoebe! You and I have
Oh, come on!
Yes, do you remember that time on the frozen lake?
We played chess, you said I was boring, then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!
Okay, there is a

Okay, I'm leaving!
Because I'm not going to spend another day with someone who wants to sabotage each of my movements.
It's you Rachel!
Yes, I have that.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how are you gay?
You take care of Jill.
OK see you soon!
Good bye!
Goodbye.
I can not believe Jill left. I can not help it, I opened a door.
How about you are moving !!
Look! It's ridiculous. We should pack you !!
Hey, how are you?
Awesome! Monica moves!
I'm not!
Oh really?! So, how come all your things are in this box ?!
Ok, guys. I think you know what's going on here. Okay, guys
No Phoebe I'm crazy!
Well, in depth!
Yeah, I'm just angry!
So keep running.

Okay!
Oh, here's the trench coat you wanted.
Oh great! Wow! Yes, it's comfortable.
Yeah?
Oh! Here we
Okay, you know what, we talked about London a lot, did not we?
No.
I am sorry.
It's just because I could not be here.
Because all I have to do now is pregnancy, it hurts me.
Sorry.
What happened?
Well, you know, a little bit of that, a little bit of that. I made an appointment tomorrow night.
You see, I did not tell you ?! You're already on Ross!
well
Get out!

I just did not see the fast song coming.
hush
hush
Do not try to talk, we will get you in your room, we will soak your feet, everything will be fine.
Oh thank you.
This is so cute!
Yeah.
No, I really think so. There are so few really nice guys out there.
Tell me about it, I feel like holding the fort on my own.
It's Joey, is it?
Yeah.
Wait a minute!
No!
I am nice!
I am the one who danced with the kids all night!
How big are your feet?
!

Uh, you do not mind sitting there. I-I keep this for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I did not know he had a nickname.
Oh, he will not stay here.
Only people in white coats are sitting there and only those in blue blazers are sitting here.
Yes, he must have fallen a few blocks. I just thought we hit a dog.
Okay.
Look, could you put Kathy, I want to apologize.
Oh yeah, man. Joey.
Hey.
Oh no, it's good, do not worry.
Yeah-no, stop making excuses, that's fine.
Yeah!
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I should go, probably.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
I forgot my handbag.
Oh.
No, I really forgot my handbag.

A new place for a new Ross. I'll have you and all the guys at work once it's furnished.
I must say that I am happy to see you on your feet again.
Well I am that. And this case of rage is definitely behind me.
I wonder if it's time for you to join our team at the museum?
Oh Donald, that would be great. I am totally ready to go back to work. What I? No! Wh what do you do? !!

.... and 12, 22, 18, four ... What?
I spelled crazy.
Ross, but me for another box of mint treasures, all right. Where, where are the treasures of mint?
Ah, we are outside. I sold them all.
What?
Monica, I cut you off.
No.
No, just, just a few more boxes.
It does not matter, all right, I'm cool.
You have to help me with a few more boxes!
My, look at you. You have a cookie on your neck.
Oh my God!
So how much have you sold so far?
Look at this. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh God, how did you do that?
Okay, the other night, I left the museum when "Laser Floyd" left the planetarium, without even trying, I sold 50 boxes!
That's when I understood, the key to my success, "the snack". So I started going to the dormitories of New York University around midnight.
I sell cookies by the case.
They call me 'Cookie guy!'
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffs, I need lickers ...
Well, who made these resumes for you?
Me! On my computer.
Like an eclipse.

Hi.
Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Do you really take all that?
Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
Yes but you do not need - What is it?
Thread!
Goal! Where are the disposable cameras?
Which disposable cameras?
Cameras? Do you remember last night, did I tell you to take them?
No, you did not do it
Yes! Remember? Just before cutting the cake, I went to you and said
Oh-oh yes, you came to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my uncle Murray came to see you and gave you a check.
And then you said, "Why are we calling this a check?"
Why not a Yugoslav? "
Yes, then you did that.
So you do not have the cameras ?!
Sorry man.
So? What? What? They left! Monica will go crazy!
Well, I'm sure they are still somewhere here at the hotel. I'll help you find them.
Awesome.
In-in three minutes.

Uh, Rachel, my parents
Ohh! It is a pleasure to meet you. Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $ 500 was for groceries.
What?
This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, it's not that's not what it is.
See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, it's a real dress actually.
That is, they are wearing it in Milan, so my job is also to wear clothes, then I see how people react, and then I report to my superiors at
Maybe in L.A?
Yes!
Here.
So, have you ever eaten children?
Well, we were going to do it after ... I mean, uh, then.
Well, we are hungry, why are not we all going to eat?
Oh, yes, well, no need to waste that baby, just stay home.
So we will eat.
Yes.
You'll wear that. We will eat, and of course, you will wear that.

Well, I guess I should have thought of my wife and children before talking to Chef Geller again!
Thank you.
Yes! Looks like it will be a leeeeean Christmas at Dragon House this year.
Enough!
Skinny skinny!

Let me see that.
This one here.
Triscadécaphobie.
The fear of
No! No, the fear of the number 13.
Fear of
It's possible, they really have sharp edges.
Okay Chandler, you're up.
Wait a minute, I think I have the right to use my Angel Pass for a free ride?
This game does not make sense!
You know what? You are just angry because you are losing.
Oh, come on, Ross, I think we're all losers here.
Okay. Chandler, you can spin the wheel or pick a Google map.
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I do not care.
You must choose Mr. Bing.
It does not make any difference either.
Choose, you moron!
I will take a card.
Ok, you chose the Gimmie card! You get all Ross points!
What?!
This game is a little fun.
You do not think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just because you
I do not think competitors are supposed to talk to each other.

Hello? Oh, hello Ross! See? Other people call me!
Very funny Ross!
Very realistic and fun.
Okay.
Oh no-no-no, I did not sign to your lady.
Whoa, maybe I was!
Hey, Monica, this totally exciting girl in Ross's building catches me.
Enter the man! Flirting, mix it!
Yeah, I-I'm-I'm with that.
OK here we go.
How is it going?
It worked!
She beckons me to go.
Ok, I-I'll-I'll be right now.
Let's see, she is on the third floor
Wow! She's pretty, huh?
Tell me, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!

Hey!
Hey!
Oh honey, I'm really sorry, you were right, it feels good!
See? And you do not worry if people are watching, it's just for a second cause, so you're gone!
Faded away! I mean his incredible Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Watch out for the horse! Sorry!

Oh, come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just crossed the hallway! And
Ahh! You're not dressed yet?
Am I naked again ?!
We are supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah all right, I was just talking to the guys. Look at them, I mean, are they okay if they come to visit us?
Wh ?! What about my allergies ?!
Oh yes, your allergies. All her, she hates you.

Shoot! We are running out of soda.
Oh, I'll get you.
Really?!
Nope! Because I am not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Well, my mother's friend, Phoebe, is actually my biological mother.
I found a dry shore.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Oh, my new mom, who is a big and fat abandoned!
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! You do not want to stay here and talk about it?
No, I just want, I have to be alone.
Monica!
Oh.

Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yes baby!
So, we have never heard of your wedding!
We were surprised not to be invited.
No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
What does not like? Cream? Well. Jam? Well. Me to? Goooooood.

Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
So, do you want to come to the restaurant for dinner in the coming weeks?
Sure!
I would love!
Really you
Well, I can not give you a massage because my license has been revoked again!
Phoebe, what happened?
Well, it was an accident ... You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand slips!
Do I have a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Oh no, you are not supposed to divorce before 7 years old!

Uh, that's nice.
I know, is not it?
No, I really think so, it's really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Yeah! And I have it on sale too.
Anyway, I should go, one of the rescuers was about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Well, if you want to have a drink later, we can.
Oh yes, it sounds good. Oh, and listen, it's going to be ...
I know. Thank you.

So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! You first get my pregnant Rachel!
You got pregnant Rachel ?!
Who has?!
You did it!
Yes. Yes, yes I did it. But, but it was, it was just a night. It did not mean anything.
Oh? Really? This is what my daughter represents for you? Nothing?
No! No sir, she is very important to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.
What?!
Oh but not like that. I mean, I mean I'm not in love with her. I love him as a friend.
Oh really? It's like treating a friend? Are you causing her trouble and then refusing to marry her?
Hey! I offered to marry him!
Wh
But I did not want to.
Well, why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp ?!
Tramp?!
I am sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.

Yes, Fran.
I know what time it is, but I'm looking at WENUS and I'm not happy! ...
Oh really really really?
Well, let me tell you something ... you'll worry about it, because I care!
You got it?
Well!
Whooooaaaa ....

Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men?
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
I could have birds.
Okay, Mr. Heckles, we will try to reduce it.
Thank you. I will join my dinner.
Okay goodbye.
Ok, Janice. Janice You have to give me Janice. It was not about being picky.
We will give you Janice.
I miss Janice, though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
"Oh my God."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's all, there, faster!"
Stop with the broom, we do not make noise.
We won. We won!
Mr. Heckles.
How did it happen?
He must be sweeping. They found a broom in their hand.
It's terrible.
I know. I swept yesterday. It could be me.
Of course, you could. We never know.
We never know.

Oh I am sorry.
Where is Chandler?
Oh, he needed time to cry.
I'm free! I'm free!
This oughta do it.

Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, I've been working there since 4 am this morning.
Where did you get fruit at four in the morning?
I went down to the docks. I bet you did not know you could get it wholesale.
I did not know there were docks.
Hey.
Hey.
Aww, is it broken?
No, I have to wear this garment for a few weeks.
Did you tell the doctor that you blew him up and down on your bed?
Nooo I had a story, but then Chandler sold me.
Well, I'm sorry, Joe. I did not think the doctor was going to know he had just fallen off the hook.
What is it? Fruit?
Monica makes jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at home?
Because children need new shoes.
I go in business people.
I'm tired of being depressed by Richard.
I needed a plan, a plan to overcome my man.
What is the opposite of man?
Jam.
Oh Joey no!
It's too hot.
It will only be my lot.

Hey, does anyone else feel bad about Ross?
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Well, he's probably angry after you call him this morning to borrow his glasses.
What? Mine are not tinted.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Ok, I will not have one.
Neither do I
No, no, it's just my tooth.
Okay, I'll have one.
So what happens, you need a dentist? I have a good one.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I come, I, I do not see it.
See it's the problem with invisible dentists.
Why? Why can not you go to his place?
Because every time I go to the dentist, someone dies.
It's so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look at the hygienist's blouse.
Phoebe, what? Uhhh what ?!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my Aunt Mary, then there was umm, John, my postman, then my friend "my cowboy friend" Albino Bob ".
And all these people are really dead?
Yes, while I was in the chair!
That's why I take my teeth so well now, you know, it's not a question of oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Pheebs, come on, you did not kill anyone, these people died when you went to the dentist.
That is, it's, ah, just a coincidence.
Well, tell them. Oh! You can not, their dead.

Hello?
Ross.
Emily, hello! Uh, how did you steal?
It was awful. I felt very bad about the way I acted when you said these wonderful things.
No, no, that's fine. Uh, I'm glad you called.
Ross, there's something I have to tell you, there's someone else.
Does this mean the same thing in England and the United States?

You know what? I will not be able to enjoy it.
Yes, I know, it's my birthday. We should all be here.
So let's go.
Well maybe you should maybe stay for a song.
Yes, I mean, it would be rude of them to leave now.
You know, guys are probably spending a good time.

Okay, I have three of my five.
Three of your five, what?
Celebrities I am allowed to sleep with.
Oh my God! You think about it a lot.
Yeah, it's hard to agree, I only have two places left.
Okay, so who did you reduce it to?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely ....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
Um, you know what, she's too political, she probably would not let you, unless you gave four boxes of food first
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, you know she's too international, you know she'll never be here.
So?
So you have to play the odds, pick someone who will be in the country like all the time.
Yes, because that's why you will not have Isabella Rosselini, geography.

Oh, it's five Ross. Five women had five babies! And I did not have a baby! Why does not she want to go out?
Do you know what I think it is?
I think you've created such a beautiful house for her in the last nine months that she just does not want to leave.
Oh. Look at you pissing me off. Oh my God!
Twenty-one hours, you are a hero.
Doctor, you must do something! I think you have to give me drugs or light a fire and smoke.
In fact, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters, you are about to become a mother.
My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha is fighting you! Suction cup!

Are they still here?
No, honey, they're not, but do not worry, because we're going to find them, and until we do, we're all here for you, okay?
Okay.
Hi.
Can I see your boarding pass?
Oh no, no, I do not have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I am sorry. You are not allowed to enter the bridge unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but I-he just went on.
He's right there, he's wearing the blue jacket, I ... I can just ... just ...
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, all right, uh ... so could you please, uh ... just give him a message for me? Please? It is
Well. What is the message?
Euh, I do not know.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me sir? Uh ... I have a message for you.
What?
It's Rachel. She said she liked the gift and she will see you when you get back.
: Toby ... Oh, for God's sake, I do not know what she's talking about!
There is no Rachel!
Do not leave me cold.

Here's the thing, Janice.
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I am like bing, bing, bing.
You are like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm really sorry. It's okay?
Ow. Uh, that's just my goal. It's just my goal. I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eyes! I hit her in the eyes! This is the worst break in the history of the world.
Oh my God. How many have you had?
Oh, I do not know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. The la la la la la la.
I'm fine.
Okay.
I'm not well. Here it is.
Wait here. Breathe.
How are you doing that?
It's like a gift.
We should always separate.
Oh, I'd like that.

You win.
What did you have?
No matter, nothing beats a three and a six.
That my friend is D-Cup.
Now, have you won a lot?
Uh, wow, 700.
Not exactly 700?
Yeah.
Double it!
What?
Well, you see in the cuts, once you get $ 700, you have to double it.
Really?
Hey, I did not invent the rules.
Now, after receiving the doubling bonus, you get a card.
Now this card could be worth $ 100, bringing your total to 1,500.
Do not get excited, because it will only happen if you make it!

I'm sorry you could not go to Spacecamp and I hope it will compensate.
Presentation of the very special Spacecamp by Sarah Tuttle!
!
Really, Mr. Geller, you do not have to do that.
Oh come on! Here we go! Be ready for the countdown to the mission!
I am a stranger. I am a stranger.
Oh no! An asteroid!

Hey.
Hey.
Where are you going?
At the bank.
Sperm or regular?
Sperm.
So you really do that, huh?
Oh yes, I chose a guy, 37135.
That seems good.
'Fraid, then. Brown hair, green eyes ...
No, no, hmm.
What?

What's the problem, darling?
Nothing nothing.
Aaaah, what's wrong, come on.
That's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.
These are my friends.
They have a problem with you.
In this, they do not do it.
Oh. They do not do it.
But they do not see all the wonderful things I see.
They do not see all the good things and all the sweet things.
They just think you're a little ...
What?
Intense and scary.

Hello.
Hi.
Yeah! You do not like Kathy.
You got me.
Yes, you've been avoiding it since we started going out. Look, I made a
Yeah. Right.
Good and hey! My treat But it's only because you eat nothing, right?
Okay.

I can not believe we are here.
Oh, you make fun of me.
What?
As a wedding present, the hotel wishes to offer you the honeymoon suite.
No!! You fucked us all day!
Who are you?
We are only ten seconds later!
Yeah!
You already have the first class tickets; you have the living room!
I mean we should have free stuff too!
I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Well, you can have the following if you want.
We do not care where we stay.
We are here to celebrate our love together.
We do not have to get free stuff.
We just want to be together.
We need these things.

Yes!
Ok, so why not a handshake?
Oh my God, I'm sorry!
Oh my God, I'm sorry!
I did not want to touch that, I mean

Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I ?!
Wow! Pleasant! Manly and also a kind of slut.
You become a woman.
which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of domination.
Ok, that's it for today.
Oh, does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Yes, it's the new building on Avenue A.
What?! That is to say that I cross the whole city, I am supposed to animate a seminar of graduate studies in ten minutes.
Ooh, man. It will not happen.
Move it! Move it! Move it !! Hey !!! I am the teacher !!

Jason?
Yeah, come in.
So Phoebe, you looked serious on the phone, ah, is something wrong?
No, and I do not think I will.
I can not do that.
Yes. Yes, that's what I did not want to know.
Well, Mark, I'm doing it for the wrong reasons, you see?
I'm just doing it to get back to Ross.
I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Ahh!
Just, schmair!
You know?
Look, if you want to go back to Ross, I'm here for you.
Really?
No-no, I say, I say, I say we answer him directly on this couch.
Right here!
Oh my God. I'm sorry about that.
Its good.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I can just go home and take my revenge.

She's there! Superstar of the future fashion!
Oh Joey, I'm barely
My little sister Dina!
And go again
I saw this movie once when there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally opened it, millions and millions of insects appeared and feasted on human flesh.
You know it would not kill you to respect your wife's private life!
Superb closet full of insects!
Joey. Joey, something seems weird and not that weird. I do not-Whoa !!
Oh hey whoa-whoa, do not worry.
Okay.
When my sisters were pregnant, they had all the strange feelings in the book, it was still nothing.
Really?
Absolutely.
Okay. Oh my God! Oo!
Okay, Rach-Rach-Rach, look at me, look at me, everything will be fine, trust me.
Okay.
Take my hand.
Here we go.
Oww crushing bones!

Oh hi.
Oh it's you. I see you everywhere. I am Jim, Jim Nelson.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson, I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We have certainly met a lot lately.
We have. Maybe we'll see each other tomorrow at dinner, for example around 8 o'clock?
Well, maybe we'll do it. Oh!

Well, it's not something a girl wants to hear.
No, come on, do not start. Ouch!
What?
Stupid balls are in the way.
Never mind. This would probably have been the most constructive solution.
You have chalk on your face.
Huh?
Oh, Ross you're right, I do not know why I always thought it was real grass.
Hey, are you okay?
My wife is a lesbian.
Cool!!
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Hi.

Hey! Where are you in these pants? 1982?
Oh Monica, listen, ah, I saw at the hardware store, they put these designer tiles up for sale.
If you ever want to remake the floor of the bathroom.
Why, what's the problem with the floor of my bathroom?
Nothing. It's just old and filthy, that's all.
I really doubt it.
Oh yes. If you ah, move your cart, you see what color was the tile. Yeah.
I can not live like this! What are we going to do? What are we going to do?
Relax. Here, hold this. This old thing comes right away.
It's a little more than what I wanted to see.
Aw!
Look at this, every inch of this thing is stuck.
It would take forever to lift that.
You should ah, you should just leave him.
I can not leave it! You have dug a hole in my dirty soil.
Eh! Here.
You know it's good, you know we could put it back there after the surgeons removed it from your colon!

Hi.
Hi!
Hey!
Uh, Pheebs, about your mother ...
Yeah?
How's it going?
So good. Oh, we took a nap today and my mother fell asleep on my belly and purred.
This is so cute. I am going to get coffee.
Huh? What did you say Joe? I will be there.
Pheebs ...
I feel so, uh .....
Okay!!
I already come !!
Good God!
Really?! Do you think that will work?
Absolutely! And if not, can I get the extra ticket?
What is this thing?

Hello.
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Hey, Joey!
Hey!
Ooh!
Ooh!
I just said that someone on the - who looks like you on the subway.
And I was going to go and say 'hello!' but then I thought, he did not care to look like you.
It only cost me four dollars. But um listen, I just called to see how are the chick and the duck?
Ohh, they have a
A little, but I have a lot of fun too.
So you still do not have homesickness?
No, I do not think so.
All right, we miss you at seven.
No.
You will see.
Liam, do me a favor. Tell the guys to go easy on Ross, this is his first time.
You do not say!
Good luck, baby.

Okay! When?!

Ok, ok, Pheebs ...
The end.
Oh my God...
Would not I tell you?
No, no, trust, me, it's much better than I know.
Uh, I just liked better before it was better ...

Well, yes, it's nice to have an unusual house.
It has ah, three nice rooms and ah, no baths.
But you know, the ocean is right there.
Knock Knock knock.
Ah, oh, wait a second. Enter, enter. All right, so think about it and call me back.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Ah yes.
Hello Phoebe Abott, I am the daughter of your best friends!
Are you Erwin's girl ?!
No, I mean your old best friend here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Oh that, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I ... then you have to be?
Phoebe Phoebe Phoebe, yeah. She named me like you, I suppose.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There is Frank

Dude, you have to turn on
Let's go watch it at your place.
No, Monica is watching a cooking show. Come on, I do not want to miss them when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, do you know what we should do? You and I should go get new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Is your cable out?
No, that's it
Joey, why is your cable?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I did not really pay the bill
If you need money, please, just let me lend you money.
No, Chandler.
Listen, forget it, okay?
Look, I know things have been a bit tight since Janine left.
Oh, was she hot?
Whoa ho.
I know!
Yes, but look, I can deal with it.
Okay?
Listen, I can listen to the radio, huh?
And Ross gave me this big book (he holds the
Okay, do you want to see if the joke thief will let us watch the show at home?
Sure.
Paid your phone bill?
Not really.

Oh, okay, I can not take it anymore.
I can not anymore.
So you win, okay?
Right here!
Pheebs?
Steal a jet?
Better to make a spaceship so you can get back to your

Hi everyone, Pheebs is here!
Phoebe!
Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe, woo!
What?! What is it going to do to someone?
This helps the bee to look hard in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I certainly am not.
Now, you know that the bee probably died after biting you.
Aw, fuck!
Back in 30 seconds people!
Hey, excuse me, could you change places with me?
Hey, no question, I'm in the shooter.
Go dude! You have been here all day!
Yes, I make promises here, huh?
We are in 3, 2,
Welcome to our fall telethon. Now, if you appreciate the performance of

ha
Yeah.
Well, what do you know?
I'll see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask him about it.
Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Yeah. Yes, that's what you need a good pill.

What are you writing?
Well, Joshua is coming tomorrow and as I do not have the courage to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put that note in his pocket.
Oh yes? Joshua, call me from time to time, guys like you never go out of style - what did you throw?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey, what did you do too?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian door knobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Without me?!
My uncle dragged us there. But, in fact, it turned out to be very interesting.
Yeah.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean, look at that!

I'm just saying, if I see another picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in this
I can not believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Will you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Well, stop thinking about me.
You can not do it, can you?
So I think of you. So what?
I do not understand. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Well ... he happens to be a very nice guy ... man ...
I mean, come on, buddy, get a
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
No, no, no ... why, because it could become strange for everyone?
Who cares about them.
It's about us.
Listen, I - I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
I know.
If we separated and I lost you ...
Oh my God.

Hello? No, she can not come on the phone at the moment. Oh, ok, no problem. Okay goodbye.
Was it my job? Were they crazy? Was it Jack? Does he scream ?!
I'm coming to relax, nobody shouted. Jack was just calling to make sure
Thank God.
Yes, she is fired.

... DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH !!! Thanks thanks.
Hey, here's a question. Where did you get the best oak east of the Mississippi?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you have the most beautiful lace from all over the country.
I'm reading your ad
Sounds good, huh?
Yeah.
Superb entertainment center. Well, beautiful Italian craft work.
Oh my God, are you selling the entertainment center?
Why? I like this thing.
You want it?
Oh no.
Ahh, Gepeto, $ 5,000? Are you crazy?
Hey, the only ad costs $ 300!
Look, I change it to $ 50, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is this ?! And you are called an accountant.
nooo
Oh. What to do?

It's true Ross, I can see you in your new apartment!
And you can see me!
Same as yesterday, same as yesterday.
Does he make his shark attack yet?
Nope. Op, wait! Here we go.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crosswords before going to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.
Yes, I think it's wrong, but there is a link between the points here for you later. Hey, how about brown?
Yes, you are so smart!
Aww, you are so cute!
I know.
Okay, see you in the morning.
Okay.

Hello?
What's with her?
I do not know.
But hey, I know we can decide.
Okay, I'm going to ask you questions and you answer very quickly.
Okay?
Okay.
What do you like best about action or comedy?
Action.
Who would you prefer to sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Dude, you're sick.
Oh I am sorry. I forgot you had this story of Rachel.

I mean, it's amazing.
I know. It's really, really huge.
No it is not. It is little. It's tiny. It is little. It's wee.
Nuh uh. I do not think any of our lives will ever be the same again.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
More than jewelry.

Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have some routine questions to ask you.
Really? I dealt with Dr. Wells.
I know, but I am a neurologist.
And for more security, Dr. Wells wanted a more complete overview of your status and he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman.
It was a test. Right answer. Very good, full name.
Clifford Burnett.
Birth date?
November 16th
Age?
Can not you understand this based on my date of birth?
I am a Dr. Cliff, not a mathematician.
I am 33 years old.
Okay. And uh, you're married.
No.
Oh really? So, 33 years old and still single, would you say that you have commitment problems?
Are all the questions also personal?
Yes.
Uh, if you have to know that I'm a widower.
Oh that's terrible. I am really sorry.
Yeah.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
No.
Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance, did you?

Hey! You are writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Pheebs, it's great!
Oh yes!
But you know, Rachel does not rhyme with stupidity.
I know but it's so difficult! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Many things rhyme with Rachel. Donut. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
All good thank you. Can you possibly have a nickname as a nickname easier to rhyme?
Was not your father calling you pumpkin?

Okay.
Ok, I can do it.
I can tell him how I feel.
Just uh, stand up straight.
Take a few deep breaths.
Look confident.
Joey? What's up?
I just went through because I want to talk to you about something.
OK what's up?
What I am doing is creating a climate of support for the people who work with me.
I see. Sidestep nice on the thing to do by the way.
The most difficult thing I have ever done in my life.
You must leave!
Oh!
OK, do not worry. You're ready.
Really?
Absolutely! Fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
Okay.

Now, Mom, everything is fine, really.
Yeah, Ross is great.
He's uh, he's in a different place.
No, he's gone.
No no, you do not need to make a return flight.
What do you mean it could be your only chance?
Do you want to stop?
I'm only 26, I do not even think about babies yet.
Where have you been?
Oh, I just had a baby.
Mazel Tov!

Oh wow! I should go there. I have an appointment tonight.
Oh yes! With whom?
Do you know that girl I talked to who lives in Poughkeepsie?
Yeah.
Not her.
Yes, it's someone else I meet, and I-I can not decide between them.
You know, Poughkeepsie, even though she's two hours away by train, is really pretty, very smart and very fun.
But this other girl, well, she lives in the upscale neighborhoods.
You know, she is, she's as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's
If she is not funny, why do you want to go out with her at all?
Well, I-I want to give him another chance, you see?
She lives so close.
And, at the end of the appointment, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was joking was very funny.
On the other hand, if she did not laugh, she's not funny, she's stupid and a little racist.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey guy!
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Heck!

Oh, here's a whole bunch.
Oh, I mean, she's going to wait for her at the wedding and people are going to whisper, "Oh, that poor girl."
You know?
Then she will have to come back here and live on her own.
Oh my God!
What?
There was a pregnancy test in the trash, and it's positive. Monica is pregnant. So I guess she will not be totally alone.

Hi.
Look, I'm sorry for all this with Roger.
It was not really good, and me, and I want to be forgiven, so I brought you something you will really enjoy.
Now, this is just a loan.
Okay?
I will want to get it back.
So I will go now.
I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can not!

Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
Okay, why do not I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor ?!
Hey, you want to do Joey a favor, maybe you're going out with Joey.

All right, ladies, here's what we're going to do.
I-I want to be with her, I like her.
Oh, I'm good! Go with your instinct, go with your instinct.
Wait, now, what am I still doing?
Come on! Could you please be careful, I could wake up anytime!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No-no-no, it's not Joshua.
What do you want from me, I've never met this guy?
Anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can not stay, but we have a

What do I look like?
Oh, uh, I ... do not care.
Ok, now, remember, no trading.
You get pretty, I understand the mess.
Hi Joey. Well, look what you brought. Very pleasant.
... and what did you bring?
She checks the coats.
Joey, I'm going to wash the taxi and feel my hands.
Will you get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Oh my God.
Hi, it's Janice.

Okay, I have not fixed everything yet. Do not tell Rachel anything, please?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although being the only one to know anything about it makes me feel special. Okay!
Ok, stop-stop! Phoebe ?!
Hi Rachel!
What was that?!
Sorry, mix. Hey, how was the movie?
I have not seen it again!
Well, you better hurry! Angelica! Go! Go!
Noooooooo !!

Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Okay, Pheebs?
Yeah?
Umm, do you know how the other day you talked about how you could not go to London and how you felt a little left behind?
Yeah?
Okay, well, we felt really bad about it, so we decided to take a little trip together!
Ohh, that's so nice! How awesome! Good or? Where is the trip ?!
We all thought of going to a picnic in Central Park!
Yes, we all! All day!
That sucks!
It's not a trip!
I just went out of the park!
What are we going to do five about the stupid Central Park?
"Well, it's right next to me, okay!"
Well, I'll go home and enjoy the triumph of my idea of ​​Central Park.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa !!
Ho-ho-wait a minute, Mr. Kissey!
You know, I wanted to talk to you about this new European thing that you have, and I just have to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and that I do not know why stop!
I was just trying to bring some culture to the group.
It's good, but do not put it in my mouth.
It makes me want to vomit!

She's in there?
Yeah. She's putting it now, it's her.
Oh everything is fine.
I guess I'm just finished with the dating thing.
It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.
It's hard.
Yeah, I know.
On the other hand, in about seven months, you'll have something you'll love more than any guy you've been out with.
Hold on.
Wait until, uh, wait until the baby catches your finger for the first time.
You have no idea.
Thank you darling.
Do you want to have a coffee?
Oh no, I think I'll go home and eat ten candy bars.
Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Oh you did, there are twenty here.
Right. Good night.
Good night.

Hi
Hi! Hi Mom.
It's a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you have pearls of wisdom?
Jack?
Why would you want to serve food on such a sharp stick?
It's a good question, dad. It's a good question
Hmmm.
Congratulations to you two!
Thank you we are so excited
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Wha-What?
Look at this clown!
Just because he has a bigger boat, he thinks he can take the whole river.
Get out of the way, you moron!
Who names their Coast Guard boat anyway?
This
What are they doing here? The coast is all there.
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! It's incredible! Joey holds his breath for almost four minutes!
Guy! What are you trying to kill me ?!

Ow!
Really?! Well, it's like everybody's apartment. It has rooms, walls and ceilings.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh, it's the living room.
Impressive.
Okay. It's the kitchen.
Oh, it's really pretty. Wait a minute, can not I see the room?
The bedroom. Well, that's about your ... typical bedroom.
We are always on this side of the door.
Um-hmm.
Yes, but I could not see it.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thank you for this beautiful evening.
So who was she?
Oh, that was the blind meeting that I told you about, she called and changed it for today.
Did you like? And I just ask as a friend, because that suits me perfectly.
Well, you look good.
Well, I do not think that, you know.
No, no, no, I would not do it myself, I mean it would be strange.
Yeah, no, I'll ask another girl to do it.
Oh, it's going to be so much fun!
Hey!
Are you excited?
Yeah! Hi, Monica and Rachel are they working there?

Ok, we need now, um sage branches and sacramental wine.
All I have is oregano and
Uh, it's good! Okay. Okay. We now need the sperm of a righteous man.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we would not do the ritual first.
Can we just start throwing things?
Ok, yes, ok. Oh ok.
Ok, Barry's letters. The boxer of Adam Ritter.
Ok, and I have the receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of naked Scotty Jared.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
No.
Eww!
And here's the last of Paulo's grappa.
Hey, Rachel, is not it almost pure ...

Mona? Okay, if I was a salmon shirt, where would I be?
I'm really sorry for spilling wine on your shirt.
Oh that's good.
No, it's still wet.
You know what?
Let me take him out before he goes to bed.
Ooh, I have something you can wear.
Right here.
Oh, uh, I - I do not know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
No-no it's a man's shirt.
It's terribly pink.

Oh that's perfect!
And you?
It's a slash bathroom kitchen.
Okay, I see what you're saying. I will go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of it. He knew! You think we could have a bathtub in our kitchen?

Hey!
Let's go see the show!
Ok, just let me have a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee and it's so close.
Closer than here?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's go skedaddle.
Wait, I'm not going to just drink someone's old coffee.
Ok, your highness.
Uh, Rachel, I'm so sorry. It's good, you want to get back together? Yeah OK. Did anyone else hear that ?!

So, how did you know I was even here?
Your mother called me. So is it?
No, it's a lender.
I'm sorry you had to do it yourself.
I was not alone. I had a doctor, a nurse and a support guy. So, did you see who won the match?
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They're void.
Yes, they are not so bad.

I'm sorry, I will not be able to go to your imaginary wedding, but I am
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I did not want him to start shouting at me like I was a certain Latour of 1974.
It's Lafite. The 'Latour '74 actually drinks quite well.
Everything here comes. I'm going to do that, I'll tell him, I'll be strong.
I just called one of my friends.
Yeah?
I think I may be able to book
Really?!
What is my darling?
There will be no marriage. Ross and I are not getting married.
What?!
I'm sorry dad.
I do not believe it !!
Oh dad now, stay calm. Please.
Stay calm?!!
How do you want me to stay calm?
It's unacceptable Rachel!
And I want to know why? !!
Is it because this punk Ross does not want to marry you ?!
That's all!
Is that right?
!
Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged.

So, are you like a zillionaire?
And you are our age. You are our age.
You know what you should like, you should buy a condition and then name it like you.
What does Pete Dakota look like?
Yeah, or, or, or Mississ-Pete.
Oh, oh, I have it! Pete-Chicago.
It's not a Joe state.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
I have to go, so ah, see you later.
Okay.
You are our age!
So, ah, we're leaving for tomorrow?
Absolutely!
Now get out of here !!
Ok, I'm running out of places where I can touch it!
Look, is there something wrong with me?
I mean, why am I attracted only to guys with no future?
Either they are too old, or they are too young, and then there is Pete, who is crazy about me and who is absolutely perfect for me, and it goes as if nothing had happened!
I mean, seriously, it sounds like something is wrong with me?
!
No.
Ok, I'll go get Frank.
So we walk down the street and I turn to you and say, "Hey, let's hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," do you remember?
And then, and then you turn to me and say, "No, let's hang out at your house." Well, it was a stupid stupid bump.

Yes, I think it was better when you were sad. Hey, do you remember in-line skates?
You know what else I will not miss?
"I am Monica.
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
Even if people are on it! "
"Hello, I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight?" Oh, I should wash it and shrink it! "
"I'm Monica, I do not get phone calls from interesting people, never!"
Hey! I call him!
"Oh my God, I love Ross, I hate Ross, I love Ross, I hate Ross!"
"Oh my God, I can not find a boyfriend!
So I guess I'm just going down the hall and sleeping with the first guy I find there! "
Yeah, we should move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.

Article J437-A, color: winterberry.
Hi uh, listen come here, come in.
I am so sorry for yesterday.
I-I'm really sorry.
It's just that I
Listen Ross, you do not have to apologize. I understand why you were here.
You do?
Yes, you still have feelings for me.
And - to be honest, I still have feelings for you.
And I wish we could solve the Ross problem, but we can not.
It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just was not supposed to be.
Oh my god you're right.
Ross, we must be strong. Ok, I'll go there. Can I? To remember?
No.

I tell you, if you want to take care of that, you should go see my guy with herbs.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I do not want to make it salty.
You know, when girls sleep with boys with strange things on their bodies, they talk to their friends about them.
Give me that.
Hi! Okay, do not be mad at me, but I could not resist.
Magazine clips?
Yes, and I know you would say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how about walking down this Donna Carin's driveway.
Oh, you would! Oh, you should get it anyway. As for clubbing.
It's so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in my bed, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
I know it's a little sudden, and it's a bit hasty, and it's not at all like I'm doing something like that, but that does not mean I can not.
Right?
I mean I'm ... I'm crazy about Pete and I know we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Oh my God.
I know. I need more pie.
Hey Monday, if you get married, can I bring two guests?
You did not break with this fireman?
No, that was my way of telling you.
Well, he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a diary and paints.
He even showed me charcoal drawings he drew for me.
Wow!
Yes, well, he would prefer watercolors, but you know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
So, are you going to throw Jason?
Well, yes, because I have to break up with someone, and okay then Jason is sensitive, but now, Vince Plus too, Vince has the body, see?
So, it's really just for calculation.

Ok, so it's still a tie, 41 to 41.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
No, I only have two points to beat him!
Monica, it was also true
I can not leave! I put four hours!
But...
Look!
You knew that about me when you married me!
You agreed to take me sick and healthy.
Well, it's my illness!
Oh yes, lobster.
Yes, I mean, I've been sick all night.
Yeah me too, all night.
Really?! How come we did not cross each other?
Yeah that's because I stayed in my room. Yes, you do not want to look in my basket.

I can not believe there is a naked whore inside!
Expect! Expect! Maybe she is a whore
Yeah, all right, let's leave these two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones do, I will not do it with a random guy!
Well! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to seeing that!

So.
So.
I just thought we should spend some time together.
I mean, you know, we never really talked.
I guess you'd know, being one of us, right?
I know, I probably should not even tell you that, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really? Me?
Yes.
Oh my god, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you and I really wanted you to love me, and that's probably because I'm totally paranoid, but I kinda feel like you may not be.
Well, you are not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Uh, all right, uh, oh my God, uh, when you and Ross started going out, it was really hard for me, uh, for a lot of reasons, for which I'm not going to bore you now, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you are together, and uh, Monica always says how nice you are and god I hate when she's right.
Thank you. Hey, listen, would you like to go to the movies someday?
Yeah, that would be great. I would love it.
I would love that too. Shoot, I have to go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Okay, Julie.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. What a manipulative bitch.

Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's fine, but I'll go with the one I chose first.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you chose is gone. It's finish!
What?
A guy bought it. I am sorry. I'm sick of stopping him but they put me in jail!
They put you in jail?
The little prison between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to keep the ring!
I know, I'm sorry! But you know, this ring is better! Monica has never even seen the other ring.
Yes, but when he offered me with the ring, I got goose bumps.
Maybe he was the guy.
It was the ring!

No, not that, I mean, and you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'm just going - I'm just going to break up with her.
No No No No No No I mean, do not do that. No, I mean not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his fit.
Thank you, Bernice. Let's go this weekend.
Oh, Barry ..! Come on, it's just as good ..
We can, we can go to Aruba!
When I went for what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh ... it was really nice.
You would have liked it.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right, Miss Green, everything is fine ... Yes, I think we're starting to see real progress here.
What?!
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.

Oh my God! what
Oh, it's a machine to remove the eyes.
Okay, I'm out of here!
I am kidding! I am kidding!
Hey!
So were done then!
Almost! But first, you have to start.
Okay.
This is a glaucoma test.
Uh-huh.
Sit.
Okay.
But your chin here. Now you will feel a little puff of air in every eye.
What?!
A little puff of air, now come!
Of course, now I'm scared.
No, we can go together! But do not wait too long, okay? Because I went out before Friday.
Yes, but I do not want to die!
No, no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!

Chandler, Ross, it's Robert.
Oh hey.
Hi.
Hey.
You have lipstick here. It's good, it's mine, we just kissed.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey hey. So, what happened? A forest ticks you?
You know we always say we need a place for mail.
Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to go to the next step.
Do you build a post office?
No, an entertainment unit with an integrated mail bin is a one-day job, max
Okay. My word! These are well adjusted.
Oh yes. These are my old work pants, those of Sergio Valente.
The electric saw was a little away from me there.

Hi!
Another cheese cake has come! They still delivered it to the wrong address!
So, bring it back down, what's the problem?
I can not say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate a whole cheese cake two days ago and you want more?
Well, I forgot what it tastes ok ?!
It was cheesecake.
It was good.
There was a crust of cracked and crumbly graham crackers, with a very rich and yet very light cream cheese filling.
My mouth just filled with saliva!
You know what? Forget it!
Yes, and we'll drop it down so we're not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

This one comes from me.
Ahh!
It was not on your list, but I hope you think it's really fun.
A scooter!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
No! No, no, I love it. Thank you.
Okay, open the next one. Open the next!
Okay.
Now that you are a couple, we do not have two gifts from you?
For my last birthday you gave me a
Okay.
Happy birthday grandma!
It's better to be above the hill than to bury yourself there.
All our love Monica and Chandler.
It's funny, yes!
No no no no! It was the joke!
No, I know! I understood! It's funny!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No, I know, because to be a grandmother, you have to be married and have children and I do not have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.
It was enough to buy the card!

Hey, Joey. What is going on?
Clear the tracks for Boobie express return. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Joey !! What were you doing?!
Sorry. Bad people.
Hello Joey
Oh! ...Hello my dear.

Man. Can you believe that he only slept with a woman?
I think it's great. You know, it's nice, it's romantic ...
Really?
No, are you kidding? The guy is a monster ..
Hey buddy.
Hi.
Oh, it's attractive.
Oh, I thought you were great in the Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the pleasure? Tell me precisely, which part was the fun part? Where is my puck?
Oh, ah - the kid has it.
The child ...? Excuse me, this is my puck.
You have to do it, man.
Oh yes? Well, I'm rubber, you're stuck, whatever - can not do it. Listen, bring me back my puck.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Give me!
Hey! Hey! No retention in my emergencies!
GIVE ME MY PUCK !!
...Now
Oh, look, wish me good luck!
Why?
I'll go get one of these things.

Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five o'clock. It's good, is not it?
You ordered a stripper for the shower ?! It's totally inappropriate!
What? He will be dressed like a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Hi!
I'm so glad you could do it.
Yes thank you very much. And again, we are sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Try. There is my little girl
She is still angry.
Yeah, I know. Is not it great? One less person with whom we have to talk.
Phoebe, Sandra is also mad at you. It does not bother you?
Oh, it's very, very, very good.
Julie's collar is dilated to seven centimeters, about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
Did you feel Rachel's collar, Rachel?
No, I do not think we'll do that.
We are not going to do that.
Well, if you wish, you can feel Rachel's, then mine to compare.
Do I interrupt you?
Um yes! Thank you.
Oh. Oh wait no.
Later.
No no no! Do not leave me here with these people.
Oh I am sorry.
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!

Try to feed her again.
I have already fed it.
I know, that's why I repeated!
Very good guys, we can not hurt ourselves, okay? It's just what she wants.
Hey.

Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder why you might need me in such a short time! Oh.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Why?
Well, first of all, for having forgotten to throw a bridal shower.
And then for having forgotten to invite you there.
Have you ever had that?
Yeah.
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a lot of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they had to leave.
Yes, we wanted to make you a big surprise and a good shower, and now you do not have any more.
We ruined everything.
Ugh
Well no, wait a minute, it's not true!
No, what was it really nice.
And it works a bit for the better.
What do you mean?
Well now, I'm showering with the only people I really like!
I mean, I get all these presents without having to talk to people I do not even like!
Surprise
On surprise.
Monica

I can not believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair !!!
Well, on the bright side, you will not have to see all these paleontologists without their shirts.
Not you guys.
You understand!
So, what are we going to do today?
They have a games room downstairs! Ping-pong and other things.
Ping pong? Honey, they have a ping-pong! Let's play!
I do not think so!
Why not?
Because you know how competitive you are, I say it's cute, others do not agree, and I'm lying!
I'm not always so bad!
Oh,
I hit you ...?
And...?
... Phoebe ...?
... and ...?
I slammed my head together!

Sorry ah, I scared you there.
Oh that's good. By the way, I just checked the shower massager.
Yeah.
Hey!
I tried to join you at work. There is ... a fire.
What?! Oh my ... Oh my God !! What happened?!
Well, we believe it started here. In the aroma room.
Okay. Did everyone agree?
Well, the giraffe is fine. And the pirate too.
Ohh What is it?
No Phoebe, do not look! You do not want to see what's inside !!
Oh, Foster puppets!

Hey.
Hey! How long before Pete's fight?
Oh, about five minutes. At this moment, they question his opponent. Apparently, he trains by going to Iran and pulls out the thieves' arms.
Hot Dog?
Four, please. I am really nervous. Thank you.
So Ross, how did it go with Bonnie?
What?
Oh!
I have to tell you, I - I did not expect to like her at all, I mean I did not expect to love anyone, but she's really great.
Too bad!
No, I say that I liked him.
Yes, you know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We are still going out.
Ok, I hear you! Are you able to talk about something else?
Hey! Which one is my turkey burger?
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fight begins!
Ok, we will be there. So, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times!
Okay, I had to put lotion!
But it's going to be fine, because from tomorrow, I will lead an experiment and if everything goes as planned, my buttocks will be completely cleared.
The fight is over!

Okay, okay, here it is! What do I look like? Do I look like a guy who does not want to get married?
Yeah! And also, a bit like a French. I had never noticed that before.
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Oh, just hang around, talk about websites.
Yes, we have seen this very interesting website about marriage and how totally useless it is and how it is a way for the government to keep an eye on you.
Yes, Big Brother.
Well, it's a little crazy. Although I am happy to know that you are about to watch what you are watching on the Internet.
Yeah, well you know, it just made me think though, why would anyone ever want to get married, huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love to each other in the world!
Well
Okay it's good to know.
Mr. Bowmont is here !!!

Oh that's great, my friend Joey is in the movie business.
Do you know who I came across school? Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently, Howie is going up now.
Yes, he called me and asked me if he could edit my new movie.
Can you believe that ?!
You know, I-I-I have not spoken to him for ten years and he's asking me for a favor!
Yes, I always hated it Howie.
No, no "How are you?" Dude, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve eh?
Yeah!
Refill?

Hey! How are you?
Well! Good, long time no see.
Yeah.
Like your sweater
Oh hey, back home.
Oh, it's crazy for Rachel, huh?
Yeah. She-Well, she's a crazy woman?
So who does he belong to?
Uh, I'm not an italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Okay.
He is so weird.

Do you want to have fun with Joey?
Yeah!
You know, since I dreamed of him and I can not get him out of my head!
And what's the problem, people do it all the time!
Who? Who do you know who are laughing friends?
Okay, that happened to me ... Don and Janet.
Who are they?
I know them about work.
Both?
No, one of them ...
Which?
I do not know, what are the names I just said?
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Okay, okay, you're right
What are you cooking?

Oh my God! How did you come back here ?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hello firefighter officer, can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the chute.
This is not mine.
Yes it is.
How do you know?
The next time you want to trigger a fire alarm in a chute, do not wrap it in a blanket saying, "Owned by Phoebe Buffay, not Monica."
Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked was always America!
Please link this, it is illegal to disconnect them.
Well! But please God tell me how to stop them from leaving!
There is a reset button under the plastic cover.
Is there a reset button ?!
Ugh, thank you!
Thank you!
There is a reset button!
My God!
Why did not I see that!
Reset button, reset button, where is a reset button?
Oh that's it!
Oh!
Oh my God!

Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Sounds, cursed!
Thank you.
Hey, you know our phone is not working?
What?!
I tried to call you coffee and there was no answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I put it out!
Just as you told him you did! ... just pointing out the irony.
Hey, so listen, I crossed the street and I talked to the porter - I got the name of the voyeur! May I use the phone?
Nngghhh !!!!!!!
May I use your phone? Yes, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating appliance."
Radiator.
Five letters
Rdtor.
Yes, is Sidney here? Oh, right? Sidney is a woman.
Well, you will have to wait your turn.
Well, how long do you think it will be?
Any minute now.
Hey, that ... Heyy ...

Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you received something from Screen Actor's guild.
It's probably a residual check, you can open it for me, I'm a little.
"The benefits have expired."
Hmm it's weird. I do not remember participating in a move called "overdue benefits".
Ok, it's not a check. They say your health insurance has expired because you did not work enough last year.
Let me see that!
Okay.
Oh, I can not believe it!
That sucks!
When I had insurance, I could be hit by a bus or catch fire, you know?
And that would not matter.
Now I have to be careful?
!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching fire.
All right, I guess I have to go get a job. I will go see my agent.
Okay, be sure to look both ways before crossing the street.
look both ways before crossing the street.

I can not believe that Phoebe is going to have her babies!
I know, it's beautiful. Unbelievable.
You know what else can not I believe?
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they did not see us make love.
Do you know something about women?
No.
It's OK.
Okay.

Do you remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats? It was fun.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Hi.
Mmm.
So how did it go?
Oh, you know ..
Did he mention us?
He said he will really miss you.
You had a hard day, huh .. come.
...I love you.
Are your hands still wet?
Uh, wet, yes.
Let's wipe them again.

Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Are you crying again?
Like a
You know, I only know two sure ways to silence a man. And one of them is sex.
What is the other?
I do not know, I never had to use the other.
I'm just saying that if we have sex, he will not talk.
Oh that's right.
You are the talker.
In any case, good idea!
Uh, I have to go to the store; I told him I would buy him more handkerchiefs.
Oh, we have some
No you do not do!

Ok, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Awesome!
Yes, which city are we close to?
Freemont. West-Westmont, Westburg ah?
So why are you answering? Do you know at least which road we are on?
Yes, we are on Route 27.
Okay. We are resting on Route 27. Okay. There is no road 27. Okay, 93 or 76?
I do not know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we got here.
Okay.
Hey, can you send someone up and down and check every rest stop, and also 93?
Okay!
Yes, no, they do not do that.
Ugh, all right, well someone will come and save us.
Who?
I mean, have you seen a car arrive here for an hour and a half?
I think we should call Ross, maybe he could take a car and pick us up.
No! No, I do not get in a car with Ross, we'll have to live here!
But if...
No guys, I do not get in a car with him, you'll have to think about something else.
Oh well, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So, getting help went well?
I tell you man, I saw him.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you are wrong.
I'm not wrong! I would like to be. I am sorry. I bet the barium enema does not sound so bad now, huh?

I know.
Let's try to look from afar.
Okay, we'll look at our future and think about our wedding and the days to come.
Chandler!
What is the problem with your face ?!
I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing get married," not "A local woman saves a drowning fool!"
Hey!
Do not laugh at him!
he is
Aww!
That's all! Take it! Take it! Take it!

We will find love!
Absolutely!
Yes, I'm pretty confident about it.
That's why it's so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
It would be nice to have a small guarantee though.
What do you mean?
Well, you know, some people make deals with a friend. For example, if none of them are married before age 40, they get married.
You mean a backup?
Exactly!
Yes, I understood that.
You do?
Hm-mmm.
Who?
Joey.
Joey ?!
Yeah!
Are you serious?!
Yes, I locked it up years ago!
Wh So If neither of you is married at 40, you will marry Joey.
Yes, we trembled. Yes, but believe me, that's not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh seriously?
Yeah, what am I going to do?
Yes, I'm sorry man. Do you want to go watch?
Yeah!

Hello.
Hi Tag! Did you have fun with Joey last night?
Oh yes! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh that's nice.
Then we went to this bar and he put us in touch with all these women!
Wo-women? Do you mean like old women?
Well a little old, like 30.
Oh.
And I was never used to talking to girls in bars, but I received 20 phone numbers last night.
It's awesome! Wow dude, so Joey really had to teach you stuff, huh?
A little.
Yeah?
How are you'?

Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You are amazing!
I know.
So, does it really hurt as we say?
What did you just say?
You are launching another difficult eight and we are getting married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.
I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes in, we take it as a sign and we do it!
Whoa!
Where did I hear that before?
Matthew Perry talks about signs in Las Vegas.
I guess it must be a movie I saw.
What are you saying?
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! Okay!
Okay! It's a four! And where is where the other?
He went under the table.
Nobody moves! Ok, you look like that; I will look like this!
Okay!
It's here! It's here!
It could be a four or five. It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.

Well, that's it. I'm finished. Phew! There come the meat sweats.
Joey, we are all very proud of you.
Yes, I think we can expect a call from the President at any time.
Is there anything we can do for you?
No, nobody presses my stomach.
You can keep these pants on.
Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you have here? What is it? Pie?
Yeah, do you want some?
Ah, just cut me some ribbon.
A little bigger
Little bigger.
What?!
Are you afraid of missing ?!
Cut me a real piece!

Phoebe, oh my God! What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God!
Of course, of course.
Umm, please excuse me for a moment, please.
Umm, do you know each other's home towns?
Why do not you do what's going on?
Well, not much.
But, I just thought that since these guys just got engaged, maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, you know?
So, could I settle down with you for a few days?
Uh, all right, yes, of course. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing, why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yes, that's it! I go to the movies and it starts in about five minutes.
Do you realize that I have a class full of students?
Oh I am sorry. I am so rude. Does anyone want to come to the cinema?

Look, look, there must be a way to overcome this difficulty.
Ok, I can not imagine, I can not imagine my life without you.
Without, without those arms and your face and that heart.
Your good heart Rach, and, and ....
No.
I can not, you are a totally different person from me now.
I thought of you as someone who would never hurt me, never.
My God, and now I can not help but imagine with her, I can not, no matter what you say or what you do, Ross.
It just changed, everything.
Forever.
Yes, but it can not be that, I mean.
So how is it done?

The windows are clean, the candles are lit.
Uh, the belt is too tight, must change the belt.
Did I return the fish?
No, because I made lasagna.
Am I out of control?
Just a contact.
Mon, I do not understand.
I mean, you've been dating this guy since, like what, his ... midterms?
I mean, why all of a sudden are you so ... Oh.
What?
Tonight could be the night?
I do not know.
Look, he's a great guy and I like being with him but ... you know.
Things are coming and they are coming.
You do not plan these things.
So, you shaved your legs?
Yeah.
A-ha!

Ross!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
OK, Raymond, Joey, you're up.
Hi!
Ok, well, let's try one. Whenever you are ready.
Uh-oh.
Is there a problem?
Well, it's noodle soup and uh, I work with tomato.
But it does not matter, no problem.
No problem.
Hmm, noodle soup.
You know, that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
How is it different? Oh! Yeah!
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay. Let's do it again.
Okay.
Hmm, the soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean the soup!
GOING !!!!
You know what? We have to move on.
No! No! I-I can do it again! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damn it!

Okay. Give us just a second. Ross!
Yeah?
Give him money.
I really think they are out of the rooms.
They are not!! Ross, they are just saving them for important people !! Okay?! And if I was the president ?!
Well, we would have a lot of problems, you do not know where the countries are.
Okay.
Uh, would it bother you to check if private parts could open?
This is a hospital.
Okay.
You know what?
I must say that I really do not like your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem with-Whoa!
Oh my God!
Whoa!
What what?
Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Do you want to see a semi-private room?
Yeah, it could not hurt to watch.

I'm just saying that if the dogs experience jet lag, then, because of all the things, seven years of dog to a year, so when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he loses not just hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Now that's funny. Who are they?
The blonde woman is my ex-wife, and the woman who touches her is her ... intimate and personal friend.
You mean they are in love.
If you want to put a label on it.
Wow, uh, all I should know?
Oh my God, Ross, I can not do that.
Ok, fast and painful.
Oh my god ... okay. Well. Well. Okay. Ross, please, do not hate me.
Oh what? What what?
Do you know Marcel?
...Yeah?
Well, I ... I lost it a bit.

Hi Pheebs!
Hi!
How is it going?
Well.
Umm Pheebs, remember that when we were in the cafe, we decided that I was going to keep the cute guy's cell phone?
Yeah.
And remember how I said I would keep it in my bag so that if it sounds, I can pick it up?
Yeah!
And do you remember stealing the phone from my purse ?!
Ooh, now you've lost me.
You stole the phone!
No I do not have!
No? So you say that if I called it, it would not ring?
No, okay. But while you compose, let me show you the features of my new handbag that rings. Oh, it works!
Phoebe!
It's not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why not check the copy room? Maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I leave them in the copy room?
I do not know Tag! How can your genitals phone? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Well.
Thank you. Hello? I still do not understand.

It's okay'? Welcome. Happy to see you!
It will be your phone.
It's awesome. But uh, I do not really expect a lot of calls.
No, you answer and make promises.
But I'm the host!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You will answer the phone.
You do not seem to understand. You see, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here is your phone doctor.

Hi guys.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out with a noisy guy upstairs?
Well, he is very charming.
I know, he's too charming, but if you start going out, it'll make it even harder to hate him.
Well, you're just going to have to try.
Joey, where are the
I do not know, Chandler is supposed to let them pass ...
Phew, close one.

Oh!
Look what happened!
Do not get your hope, we can only see it from back or neck.
I wish that the networks diffuse another nudity than the buttocks of Denis Franz.
Hey.

Ok, ten streets down. Five to go.
Oh, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh I am sorry! Do you need a break?
My boots in tanning! Hey! Can you get closer so I can see the price?
I can see it from here. It will cost you a husband.
OK I am sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just give me my boots.
Come over!
Oh my God!
Yeah, you like that, do not you?
Oh yeah right here!
You want it there? You take him there baby!
Uh Phoebe?
Yes, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you, and uh, we'll never do that again.

Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you're supposed to be!
Huh?
Because I really can not understand it!
I'm talking to you and it's nothing.
You look at me, and nothing.
Nothing.
You make me fly! High! Ok, we'll get it here tomorrow.
Well, that was ah ...

What?! What are you doing?!
Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We made love and we fell asleep.
No, we were in the middle of sex and
Nooo! No that's not true. No, the best time of my life! Yes, you rocked my world!
Do not worry, Chandler, it's not a US globe.
Hey guys, I'll go for a ride.
Phoebe, why are you moving your bag?
Oh no!
Seriously, it's moving!
what's inside?
It's just my knit is everything! Yes! I knitted that. I'm very good.

There will be a moment in each of your careers where you will have the opportunity to get caught by another soap opera actor.
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
And I am ashamed to say that I took it, I advised another actor to play a homosexual role.
Yes, we both auditioned for the role and, uh, it turned out that they liked the stupid gay thing and threw it away.
And now, he has a two-year contract with Susan Luchhi, the first lady of the daytime television, and I'm stuck here to teach a group of people, most of whom are too ugly to be in television.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

Rachel?
I'll be outside in a second.
Oh. It's so unexpected! I uh boy I'll tell you that it's just such an honor to be nominated for a
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
in reservations at 8:00 am by Neil Simon. Thanks Neil. Thank you for the words.
Ok honey, you can finish this later we'll be late. We must go.
Please, do not play music. Just another one.

I can not believe you do not want to know.
I mean, I can not not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and that Carol knows, and Susan knows ...
And Monica knows ...
Wha, heh, how could you know, I do not even know!
Carol called me to thank me for lasagna, I asked her.
So what are you gonna be?
Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows and I do not know!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited to be an aunt!
Or an uncle ...
Hi Phoebe!
Hi Pheebs!
Pheebs!
Well!
Phoebe, what's the problem?
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm uncomfortable.
Oh, ok, it's me!
Hey, Chandler, this table closes at 7 am, come on.
Well.
Phoebe, what is it?
Okay, do you know Paolo?
I know his work, yes ...
Well, he made a move on me.
Whoa, the store will be open tomorrow!
No more coffee here, please!

Hey.
Hey. What are you doing here?
Well, I thought a lot about what you said, and uh, I realized, at least, maybe I was a little critical.
Yeah, oh, but oh ...
Listen, Phoebe, remember, hey, they just filled their Christmas ...
Destiny.
Sure.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay. Yuck! This one does not look very full.
Oh, that's it, it's one of the old ones, it just takes it to the back.
You keep the old ones in the back, it's so age-old.
We must make room for the new ones.
So, what happens to old guys?
Well, they enter the shredder.
Why do I feel that it's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo !!!
Hey! Hey !!

The light is always off?
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they take a nap.
Oh please, they make love.
Shut up!
So, whaddya think George is like?
I think he's shy.
Yeah?
Yeah. I think you have to pull it. And then, when you do it, he is a BCBG animal.

Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you do not know me, but I'm a big fan. I want to say,
You're not with this girl there?
Well, yes, a little.
Uh, but it does not matter, let's see we have an understanding, um, let's see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you.
No, no, no, it's flattery.
I am sorry.
Oh no, no, no, wait wait Isabella.
Do not reject it so fast.
I mean it's a unique opportunity in a lifetime ...
Yes for you. Is this the list?
Well yes.
Can I see it?
Um no.
Come on!
But ok.
I am not on the list!
You see, but it's not the final version.
It's laminated!
You see, you were on the list, but my friend Chandler raised the very good point that you are international, so I hit you for Wynona Rider, local.
You know it's ironic ...
What?
... because I have a list of five funny coffee trees and yesterday I hit you for that guy over there.
We are just going to be friends.

Get out of here lurker yourself! Keep on going! Get!
Hey Pheebs!
Ohh! You have made up!
Yes, I could not blame him too long.
Yes, she could not live without Chan Love.
Ohh, take a room.
We have one.
I know. Use it.

Oh my, listen I have to ask!
Ok, Joey Tribbiani invited me to go home, does he do it now with a lot of girls?
Yes a lot. A lot a lot!
Ohh! And I am one of them !! Wow! Oh, I can not believe it! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, you know it's none of my business, but are not you married?
Yeah. Oh, I just wish we could not be married for a bit! I just want to be like on a break!
Ross! I think she's trying to do something with you to avenge me!
So that's the only reason she could be here, huh?
It could not have anything to do with the fact that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put a
Ross, I tell you she's using you to avenge me!
You know what?
I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Whoa!
Uh, it was your sister actually.
She thinks she's just using me.
So?

I am sorry.
What are you doing here?!
I-I came to fill your ice bins.
What?!
Uh, all right, all right.
I took this picture in your fridge.
Ok, because I know it's my dad.
Yes, here is Frank Buffay and you stand right next to him.
Now, look, I deserve to know where I come from.
Okay?
So, if you can help me find my father, then you should!
Otherwise, you're just mean!
So, tell me the truth!
All right, the man on the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My father is Chuck Magioni?
No, no, it's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
And I'm really sorry, but I do not know where your father is, and that's the truth.
Oh.
But, uh, you're right.
I think a person should know where it comes from.
Wh-that's why I ah, ah, okay.
I am your mother
He h?
You know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I felt a little at a time, and ...

What happens to your accent?
Come again?
What is this nonsense?
Okay, I'm not English.
I come from Long Island.
I was really nervous and the accent just came out.
I am sorry.
So, if we could just go back to the conference.
Umm, were there any questions?
About paleontology.
Okay, I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I messed up.
But what you think of me is really important because I hope to get a permanent job here.
So, if you give me another chance to make a good impression
Ross !! Are you insane?! I am
Well, hello Rachel!

Where are you going, Joe?
For a walk.
Oh. Do you mind if I join you?
In fact, it will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Your thoughts? Plural?
Okay, all right, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I have to see her!
I'm afraid I will not let you do that, Joe.
Now, are you telling me that I do not see her?
You kill me guys!
She is a forbidden fruit!
It's like ... as if she were the princess and I'm the stable ... Why do you do that, huh?
Did Ross tell you not to let me go?
Yes, in fact, he did it, so I can not let you go.
Huh. Interesting. Now, there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. These are the kinds of things that big novels do.
Great novels?
Well ... mediocre porn

Okay, I think we can get the assessment before they see it, but we'll have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.
Now he does not come home until 10 am, so he has no problem, but his assistant, Betty, arrives early to have her breakfast at her desk.
It's a little sad.
Yeah, ben Betty is a little sad. That's why I think I can attract him with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her,
I got it!
Ride!
Hi Rachel, do you have a minute?
Yes, of course, Mr Zelner, for you, just minutes. Okay. Well. Abandon the plan, abandon the plan.
In fact, I would like to speak with you two.
Okay. Well, can we, can we get you something, Mr. Zelner? Maybe chocolates?
Cassie, do you agree?
Yeah! Thank you very much for letting me stay here.
Oh! No problem! I
What?

You are iron.
You are steel!
Let me ask you something. How come I call an hour and a half when I call your IT help desk?
I told you, we are adding new operators all the time. Can we focus on my training?
I mean why, of all people would you like to go out with Chip ?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools ...
Ok, that does not help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to a place where you were popular, and you had to get out of Chip's bike and wear his letter jacket.
I went to one of them where I wore a group uniform that they had to have specially made.
They had to have that specially done ?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec courses.
Oh my God, they told us it was for the mascot!
At the time, I thought I would never, never have the opportunity to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he called me and invited me out.
And the fat girl in me really wants to go.
I owe him that.
I never let her eat.
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh really?!
Yeah. If it were possible, could you leave it somewhere and go make love to another guy?
I'll try.

Hey! Great guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl with whom you dance.
Yeah, yeah, alright.
Uh, buddy, I came with this girl and I had this plan to kiss her at the New Year's countdown - I'm trying to win her, so I wondered if
Oh come on, man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, sweet!
I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could let you know
Ross, finish! It's not like she hates you.
Yes, but
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be unique.
Huh. Do you know what is not unique? A twin!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh, Phoebe is here! Okay, turn off all the lights and watch the movie!
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Oh, do you like that? Do you want to know where I got it?
Sure!
He had a flea market!
Did you buy your sheets at a flea market? Ross, come on, you have to loosen the drawstrings a bit.

And Joey?
How do you think she's going?
Am I the only one who does not think she's hot? Ross?
Uh, I mean, I think she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Thank you!
Now that Rachel is gone?
So hot that I cried myself to sleep last night.

Oh, god help us.
What?
Kitchen tile for the ugly ugly dude. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking for a favor here. If I do this for her brother, Angela may come back to me.
What is happening here? You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but I made a big mistake. I should never have broken up with her. Could you help me? Please?

So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Jump on you in the shower over there.
Yeah! And maybe one day we could find a place with two bathrooms.
Listen Carol, uh, I thought, maybe we could spice things up a bit.
What do you mean?
Carol our sex life is-it does not work
Hi little guy!
Hey, hey, hey, why do not we get shoes, huh?
Why not show Dad how you can put your shoes in your room!
Yay!
!
Yay!
Yay!
Seriously, our sex life, I thought, maybe I do not know, we could try new things.
You know?
To have fun?
Like that?
Well, I do not know, uh, if we were too attached to each other?
Hmm, some people eat things on top of each other.
Nah!
Umm, you know, we could try vulgar words?
Um, we could, we could do a trio.
I like this idea!

Hey Sophie!
So, who had the idea to put everyone at the table on skates?
Oh, a silly customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
It was you?!
Yeah! Ok, that's it.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Oh my God, are you guys?
Are you doing OK?
Oh my.

Sit down!
Hi.
Oh my God, Joshua!
All these things I said about not being ready
They are not true?
No, they are all true.
Oh.
But
Oh! Oh, I love it but.
Do you want to go inside and have a coffee?
Yeah.
Okay. Everytime.

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you will not believe what I have to do to work today.
Yes but Ross you
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs some bumps!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just thought we could have them whipped, then add onions and peas.
Why would we do that?
Well, because they would be like my mother made them before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes are coming.
Ok, goodbye guys. Thank you for everything. Oh sorry! Oh sorry!
The most incredible thing happened. The outsiders have just escaped.
The ball?
No, no, the cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's everywhere in the news. Just before reaching
I can not, I have to go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog went wild on the town. How often does it happen?
Almost never.
Do you have the keys?
Okay.

What do you think?
Lotsa things.
Which do you think she is?
Can I help you?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to watch.
You do not watch dance classes. You
What does she mean?
I think she means' you
Okay, do you see anyone you think is me?
People! Last time, empty yoghurt containers were trailing after class. That it does not happen again!
She could be you.
Let's start. Five, six, five five seven seven eight ...
Ok, I do not understand that!
I get it totally!
Have you ever felt that sometimes you are so incredibly uncoordinated?
What? You just click when they click.
Good people, now everyone takes a partner.
Okay. And, my, dead, mom, said, you are, that. I am with Rachel.
Awesome. This is the gym class again.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it's never been that way.
Nooo, it was not.
Ooh, and it's so nice to have this little sink here ...

Oh, that's not nice? It's so quiet, I could lie here all day.
I know
Open your curtains! Open your curtains!
I am so happy that we have adjacent rooms!
The sun is out!
Hey! Do you remember when I had corneas?
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I go to get magazines and lotion
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Nooo!
Damn it!
The walls are rather thin, guys!

Hi, my name is Joey Tribbiani and, with all due respect, I would like to donate some liquids.
We are actually at the end of one of our research cycles and we are not looking for candidates at the moment.
Too bad. I saved a little. Uh, are you sure there are no studies I can participate in?
Well, here's a calendar of what's going to happen.
Thank you. Well, but this one is starting now.
Oh, that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a study of twins.
But it's $ 2,000.
Sorry.
Well how about this one? Test the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive receptionists.
We have already got the results on this, and they are not good.

Hey! How are you'?
Well, little has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes it is! I made cookies!
Oh that's good. I'm still full of your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now because they are hot from the oven.
Okay.
Oh-ho! But not here! You can not eat them in bed, remember? No crumbs!
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Okay!
What are you doing?
That does not lock the fact?

You know, it still smells like ape in there.
This saves us a conversation.
Well, listen, it's been great but I'm officially erased.
Me too, we should go.
No.
Oh. Mine does.

Ok, here is another camera.
Right. Not that serious. Stay loose.
Why do they continue to do that?
If we want to go to the camera, I think we have to get on one of these platforms.
They have registered these people all day.
Right.
Hey, what did you do to put yourself in it?
Oh yes? When you learned to dance, did you forget how to put underpants?
Yeah!
Hey! You are a good dancer!
Really?
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a bit.
What do you mean?
Like that.
That's it, feel the rhythm. It's better.
Uh-huh.
Ok, you dance with this girl there.
No, no, no, no, we came together!
I do not see it You dance with the big guy there. Great guy, raise your hand!
No-no hey buddy, please, let me dance with this girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Really, do you think? I do not..

Why are not you back yet ?!
Is there anyone?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm right, I'm just looking out the window. In sight. What are you guys doing?
We have some
Oh, he brought her back to her apartment.
Who? Is she your sister?
Ugh, she
My god, Ross is on a date with your sister! How is this weird ?!
Oh my God, look, look, he undresses!
He takes off his coat!
Oh, it's just terrible.
Ross! Expect!
Elizabeth, thank you god! I was just thinking of
You are afraid !!
What?!
Ok, the break is still here!

Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I understand that if you came to hit me, I deserve it.
No, I do not want to hit you.
Oh what then? Hit me?
No.
My son? Rather serious. Oh, hello Katie! What are you doing here?
Well, the delivery was delivered to you and I understood that they had forgotten it.
Oh, it must have been pretty obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Listen carefully, home delivery is really part of my job description.
Oh.
Oh uh, I really came here to ask you out.
Oh! Wow! Um yes! That sounds good. I'll just put it back in my pocket, pretend
Sure!
Hot slut. No! You are a horny slut! Noooo! You are the horny slut! No! You are a horny slut!

Chandler !! You have the best taste in men!
Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had a great time last night! I mean, I think it might turn into something serious.
Really?! I thought you were not looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for an adventure.
Well, you know, maybe. Did not you tell him that? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for an adventure ?! You do not say that to the guy!
Why not?! I would love to hear that a sexy girl was just trying to become oh, I see.
Oh, between telling him I wanted to have an adventure and I'm going out on the first date - oh, he's going to have a bad idea.

Well, I'm back in high school, I'm in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize that I'm totally naked.
Oh yes. I had this dream.
Then I look down and realize that there is a phone ... there.
Instead of...?
It is true.
Never had this dream.
No.
Suddenly, the phone rings.
And they did not look at you before ?!
Finally, I think I'd better answer,

Honey! At table!
What does my little chef have for me tonight?
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Yes! And a lot of that!
Thank you darling. Give me some sugar here. Okay.
Ok, here we go.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How are you'?

Something is wrong with Underdog, and they can not get his head to swell.
In any case, his head looks like Broadway, that's right, and I think ... how inappropriate it is.
Um, I have something in my eye, Joey, could we check in the light, please?
Oh my God.
What?
Hi! Were we at the same table? It's like ... cocktails in the Appalachian Mountains.
Come on, they are close.
To close? She has her tongue in her ear.
Oh, like you've never been so agitated with Ross.
Joey, it's sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's not really true, is it?
Well, who can say what is true? I want to say...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Okay, listen, I'm not proud of that, okay? Well, maybe I'm a little bit.
Oh!
Ow!
I'm outta here.
Wait wait. You want it, I want it. He loves you.
Really?
Yeah. I think if we put our heads together, we can separate them.

Hi! A wedding please!
Yes, we want to get married!
Okay.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What are you doing?
Oh it's
No, only because it's the graduation song.
Okay! That's it ...! We will get married!
Are you sure you want to do that?
Hello, Mrs. Ross!
Hello, Mr. Rachel!
Expect! Okay!
Would you ever be a substitute for someone?
It depends on who asked.
What if I asked?
Oh, Monday, of course.
Really?
Yes. You do not ask are you?
No.
Yes! Totally!
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!

You will not believe it! Joshua went to work today and guess what happened?
He asked you out ?!
No, but I showed him cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Saucy!
What is it?
Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, should I be scared?
I know this switch does something, okay?
I went down to the town hall and found them.
All I had to do was pay $ 25 and wait in line for three hours.
Wow! If only more people knew.

Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all think. But Chandler is in
Yeah! No, that's what I thought.
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before judging me.
Oh, no one is judging you.
Oh! Okay! You, the right place at the right time, call me!
Oh man!
I want so much this place !!
I was so sure it would work!
There are twelve dollars that I will never see again!
All right darling, we'd better go see this movie.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye Chandler! I already miss you.
Ok, did you see that ?! With the inappropriate and pinch !!
In fact, I did it!
Ok, so now you think she's attracted to me?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows for us!
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows it and she's just trying to panic us! That's the only explanation for that!
Okay, but what about my crushable buttocks and my biceps bulging? She knows!

Ross, you've been here a long time. I'm starting to be a little panicked.
Okay, I'm going out. Hey, can you turn off the lights?
No, leave the lights on.
Oh my God!
Do you want to go now? Because I'll take you right away, buddy! You want to leave?
Oh good.
Ready? Fight!
Okay, you know what, in fact, it's great. It helps a lot. Thank you.

Remember that something so long and difficult is going to be difficult to achieve. Fortunately, I have a lot of experience in this area.
Can we focus here, the life of a naked man is at stake!
I tell you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a fat guy dead on a stick.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go.
Stable.
Stable.
Ok, a little higher.
Watch out for the angle.
Okay, okay, we're getting to the window Thread the needle.
Thread the needle.
He is alive! He is alive!!!
And yet, we always push it.
OK, remove the device, remove the device.
He does not look happy.
Hey-hey, now he shows us his device to sting.
Hey, it'll never happen so far, buddy!

Well, they have unusual animal names for each other.
Including uh, nasty bitch and uh, bastard sick.
Oh my God oh!
Contraction!
Yeah? Okay.
Ooh! Ow !!
Are you looking at her ?!
No!
Do not look at her bastard sick!
Honey, I swear! I did not look at her!
She is in work! You like that, son of a sick bitch!
Umm. Uh, I - I'm just gonna
See? See? It was because you were looking for a big pervert!
No-no, I'm sure no one was watching. I just want a little privacy.
Are you missing your girlfriend?
Ignore them.
Ross.
What? What?
He looks at me
Hey! Do you want to live to see your baby ?!
Do not talk to my husband like that, bastard!

Pat Sajak?
Yes!
Alex Trebek?
Oh of course!
Chuck Woolery?
Absolutely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host that I can not kick.
Say it!
Let's say we are unagi!
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Say it!
You know what? I can easily get out, but there is a chance that you are very hurt!

Hey, Rachel, I can borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yes, it's in it.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oohh !! Ohh! Oh oh oh! Oh oh !!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!!!
Yes. Yes.
You?! And-and you ?!
Yes, but you can not tell anyone! Nobody knows!
How?! When?!
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a fuss about it.
But it's a big deal !! I must tell someone!
No no no no no! You can not!
Please? Please?! We just do not want to talk to everybody, okay? Promise me not to say anything.
Okay! Dude, it's amazing! I mean, it's
I know, it's great!
Aww, I do not want to see that!
We are so stupid! Do you know what's going on there? They try to take Joey!

And my sophomore was Ms. Thomas, and my freshman was Ms. Cobb.
Mrs. Mrs. Gobb?
No Cobb, as in Cobb salad.
Now, what exactly is in a Cobb salad?
Ahh!
What are we going to do? What are we going to do?
Uh, uh, let's move on. Ducks or clowns.
Oh, are we going back for the baby?
Do you have a better idea?
Okay, call that in the air.
The Chiefs.
The head is.
Yes! Phew!
We must assign heads to something.
Right. Ok, ok, ducks are heads, because ducks have heads.
What kind of scary clowns have come to your birthday?

Ok, some tips of the trade.
Now, I have never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take tweezers and start shooting.
Or, ah, or, let's say I want to convey that I just did something wrong.
That would be the base "I have a hook in my eyebrow and I like it" Well, let's say I just got bad news, well, all I'm doing here is trying to divide 232 by 13.
And that's how it happens.
Big show interpreting everyone tonight, class returned
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Eh eh.
Then I will have to ask you to keep it to a minimum.
Who are you?
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm going to be Chandler's new roommate.
I am Chandler's new roommate.
I-I-I do not think so.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
But, he told me on the phone.
He told me in person.
It's weird.
Well, I'm going to my new apartment now. Ehh!

Hey! Look who I found!
Oh, hey guys!
You know, the birds have a very good sense of direction and I thought maybe they could help us find where the gifts are hidden.
Yes, if the gifts are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your smart jokes - ideas?
No!
I did not mean it!
Ok, come on guys, show us where are the presents!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica had garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could do to make Monica as good as garbage?
Hmm, what about my azzz?
Hey, it's hollow.
What?
This bench is hollow! I can not believe I never knew that! Oh, the gifts !!!
No, do not look at them directly!
What?
Well, no, we could watch them!
I

Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's going to take time. I - I wish you called first.
Oh, I'm fine, I'll come back later with your dad.
Oh good.
In fact, I needed to talk to you before birth.
OK what's up?
I brought something I want to give you, assuming of course you want it.
Ma, are you asking me to marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
No, come! Thank you.
Listen to me!

It might have happened if I had been more nurturing, if I had paid more attention or if ... I had a uterus.
I can not believe that!
I know no, no, you know you do not deserve it, you do not do it, Ross.
You are really very good.
Thank you.
And you are so nice. And you are nice
Thank you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Huh?
Okay that's good.
Oh.
Wait wait.
What?
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
What?
No, I can not take it out.
Rachel?
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Hi. I just talked to Joanna and she loves you. You have it, you have the job.
Oh yes!
Yes.
Oh my God!!
Bravo !! -lations-lations.

I can not believe I did that! What an idiot!
Oh, stop beating you up!
People make mistakes!
These things happen!
There is no message you forgot to give me, there is?
Apparently you're not very good at it!
I
Philadelphia cream.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I have goose bumps.
Really?
You see, I'm wearing diapers and it's hot.
Yeah yeah.
But if-no, look, okay. These jerks may not care about you, but about the universe! And that says a lot!
Did you hear that ?!
I do not need you to pay attention to me!
Because the universe cares!
The whole universe!
I really wish they cared a little.
You know, I do not ... I do not think it's you.
It's a weird place.
Hey!
Guys!
Oh no, it's you.
Yeah.

I like this one. He seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
They can not all be bad. Find the one where you make the eyes of your bedroom. Oh, that's it.
Oh my God! These are the eyes of my room ?! Why did you already sleep with me?
Do you really want to shoot this thread?
I'm having a great time!
Me too! I'm sorry this guy in the subway has licked your neck.
Ohh No it does not matter, it's a friend.
Hey, uh, I do not want to be presumptuous, but I have these two tickets for the ballroom dance finale tomorrow night if you want to go?
Yeah, well you know I-I mean I missed the semifinals, so I would be just lost.
I know it's really bad, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Ok, do not panic. I go.
No, it's my ex-wife Whitney who is outside. I can not take care of her now. This woman is crazy!
Ok I know. Wait. Hi Ross?
Yeah?
Yeah, it's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife, you think now that you can turn her away so we can escape?
What?! No!
Okay, but I have two tickets for the finals of the ballroom.
Listen, I do not think Pheebs. Okay, I will do it. But just because you're a friend.

Well, I-I-I finished with that. Do you want something, Ross? Sports? International? Apartment ads?
I'm going to do sport.
Mine!
Okay. Uh, international.
Ok, listen, I-I know what you're going to say
You two will have very hairy children.
Ok, I did not know you would say that.
Ross! Janice ?!
Okay, wait!
Wait.
Wait.
It's Ross, okay?
This is our friend.
He has obviously gone mad.
He obviously lost his mind.
Look, I
So, are you going to see her again?
Phoebe! Do not put ideas in his head!
I
Damnit Phoebe !!

Hey, should not we ...
Yes, we have ah ... hmm.
Umm, I think you're really, really great ...
Oh my God!
Here we go again.
Why does this happen to me?
Is it something that I broadcast?
Is it my fault?
Or am I just crazy?
I-I-I-I-I-I do not know, I do not know what to say.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back home.

Expect!
Terry!
Please!
Listen, I just lost my other job.
Okay?
You have no idea how much I need this.
Please, help me, for the sake of the good old days.
This poor guy has been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
It is not without hope! Dr. Stryker Ramoray is a miracle worker. Look, he's coming here.
Hello. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
I'm back baby! Hahaha!

This kid really kicked me on the plane.
Well, you pulled her hair.
He took my snack!
I will not do it again!
Okay! Oh God, what do you know? It's really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Right here. The. Okay.
That does not mean anything, does it?
Of course! Only an idiot would carry that kind of thing if you did not have the car! Right?
It is true.
Yes, but only a genius could swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I was there. Yes, I will drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you do not have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! I am in the character! Do you want to talk to him!
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really stinging me.
Okay, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
What?! No, you can not, you can not leave me here with them! We are babysitting!
The babies are asleep, I'm sure everything will be fine for you for a while!
But you can not leave me with them! We are a team! We play a zone! They will triple my team!
There is something plastic in your throat, you have to go to the hospital.
But no, because a doctor will not be able to help him, but he will naturally go through his system in about seven years.
I think it's gum.
I'm sure it's a firearm.
Ok, listen, it really hurts. Let's go.
A real man would not rush to the hospital! No! What would he do, what would Krog do?

It was the only way I could do it
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Do not call us that!
The judge did not let us cancel! Now we have to divorce !! Did a Porsche vomit you?
Hey! It's Porsche !!

Hey darling!
Hey!
There is no return to this sofa!
Why are you reading this? You hate this stuff.
Yes I know, but I thought a blow, you know?
Maybe one of these stories would make me cry and then you would not think I was you know, all dead inside.
Oh that's so nice! Listen Chandler, I do not care if you can not cry, I love you.
Oh, it makes me so hot in my hollow chest of metal.
Stop that!
No, I mean, come on, think about it seriously, we get married, we get up at the altar and I'm like that.
I do not care, because I know you're going to feel everything here.
Yeah?
Of course he is!
What, do you think I would use my son as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
OK sorry.
I have to make a fake Ben.

The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors have eaten all the candies!
Well, either that or um
Joey !!
Yeah?
Have you eaten all the candy from the neighbor ?!
Uh, yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got there, there were only a few pieces left!
Yes, and they spend the whole day. They love it!
They like my sweets? Oh guy !!! I have to do more !!
Hey Mon, you could also do more lasagna, because something may have happened.
Ross! Neighbors have eaten all my candies !!
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a
Sure!
Yes, since you told me this story about this bike, I could not help but think about it.
I mean, everyone should have a-a
Oh my God Ross !!
You like this?
I
Yeah?
Hello darling.
And here's dad!

Here it is! Here it is!
Or?
Where we searched all night!
He is so cute!
Oh, George, drop the towel!
Yeah, let it go! Drop the towel! Please drop it - wowww.

I have to tell you that Bob is awesome.
Yes, is not it?
It's really great to meet a smart, funny guy who has an emotional age beyond eight years.
You know what else? He is amazing in bed.
Sensational. My brother never even told me when he had lost his virginity.
Huh. It's good.

and the miracle was that this little bit of oil that should have lasted just a day, burned for
Eight whole days.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Chanukah today. The end.
Impressive!
Yeah?
My favorite part was when
The armadillo was actually not so
Hey!
Oh.
Wow! It sounds like the burial of the Easter bunny here.
Come on, come on, let's light the candles!
Oh.
Oh.
Okay, I understand why

He says, 'Walking with you gives this strange city the feeling of being at home.'
Yes of course. Good luck!
I leave!! Woo-hoo! I'm fine!! I'm fine!!
Wow! It's exciting, you went to Japan, you made up a woman.
What?
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictional. No?
Why would you say that?
Because you still love Monica.
So you told her there was someone else so she would agree to work with you, so because you think that if you spend a lot of time together, maybe something could happen, and .. .
You're good. You're good!
Yeah, no, I'm pretty intuitive and psychic. It is a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you will not tell him?
Absolutely, oh I promise you. Tell him what?
Thank you so much.
No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive, but my memory is nil.

Excuse me, forgive me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
For God's sake, are you going to let him go? There is no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I understood.
Oh, thanks darling.
No problem. I am looking forward to meeting my friends.
Really?
Yeah.
Do not you think they will judge and ridicule me?
No, no, they will. I'm coming ... uh ...
I can not wait.
I know you?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How are you?
Well, well, I'm a lawyer now.
You can not be a lawyer. You are eight years old.
Look, it was nice to see you. I have to run behind the scenes.
Uh, wait, behind the scenes?
Oh, yes, my firm represents the group.
Ross.
Chandler.
How are you?
Look, do you want to meet the band?
Come on.
So, are you one of those who had fun with my dad?

Do you have respect for your body?
Do not you realize what you are doing yourself?
Hey, you know, I got it with you, your cancer, your emphysema, and your heart disease.
In the end, smoking is cool and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to talk to you.
Really?
He does?
Hey, buddy, what's up!
Oh, she told you about it, huh.
Well, yes, I have one from time to time.
Well, yes, now.
Well, it's not that big ... .. well, it's true, ... Gee, you know, nobody, nobody ever said it like that before.
Okay, thank you!
God, he's good.
If only he was a woman.
Yeah.

Hey, Frank
Look, all right, I know you think I liked this totally evil thing, but I did not do it.
There is someone here who can explain that better than me.
Hi Frank
Hello, Mrs. Knight.
Phoebe is right Frank.
I know it's difficult to hear, but we would have been wrong to do it.
I-I-I was selfish, even if we, we want the same things now, in the future we can not.
Is that right?
Yes, but not only that.
Yes, not only that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do
However.
However. Uh, you are too young to really know what you want.
That's right, exactly.
Okay, it's a goodbye kiss, that's good.
Bye.
Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, you know, you know, it's clearly wrong.
Okay, I decided to let that happen!
Ok, can I just have my bag?
Alright Alright.
.

Oh, look, look.
The last candle is about to go out.
10, 9, 8, 7 ... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48 ...
Thank you.
Thank you.
A little ... spooky without any light.
Bwah-hah-hah!
OK guys, guys? I have the definitive. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah ...
Oh oh oh.
Hi Ross. This is probably not the best time to talk about it, but you have to have a party for Monica.

All this takes a lot of space. Hi, how is it serious to keep Ben in your life?
You have blown them!
Oh, I can not tell you how good it was to watch the crowd and see your face!
I mean ... uh, did you know that you were talking to me?
L was
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Oh my God! I am your
I'd better not find you naked in my hotel room!
Look, I took it too far!

Ok, Monica: The right foot is red.
Could have played
Thank you.
Ok, Pheebs: blue right. Well.
Hello? Oh, Rachel, this is the
Oh ok. Do you want to take my place?
Well. Yes, it's Rachel.
Nooo!
Hello?
Oh, yes, no, I know, I-I did not use it much.
Oh, well, thanks, but it's okay, really.
Green. At the Green light.
I have magic beans. Never ever mind.
Left, left - aww!
Ohhh ... I'm fine.

Hey!
Please tell me that you have received the message!
What message?
The actor who was playing on Mac could not do it, he needed to see you at 2 pm
What?! It is 6 o'clock!
I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
I wrote it on the board, then I went everywhere in New York looking for you!
I went to Ross's house!
I went to the cafe!
I went to any place where they made sandwiches!
Is it the day you die? See-darnit, I shuffleboard that day.
It's what you think.
Well, I mean, what about your grandmother's friends? Would not they have the recipe?
Well, you know, parents in France may know it. My grandmother said she had received the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What was his name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Nestle Tollhouse
Oh, you, the Americans, still boil the French language.
(grabbing a bag of
Yes!! Oh.
I can not believe that I just spent the last two days trying to find the recipe and that she stayed in my closet all the time!
I know! You see it's like that, that's why you burn in hell !!

So, we are decided, not on the plaid, yes on the rose?
Absolutely!
I am so much on board!
Rachel, did not you just light that?
Yes, I did, but you know what? I'm really trying, really trying to reduce, you see? Good luck, Rachel.
In fact, I thought about quitting smoking recently.
Oh, of course, every Sunday night I think I'm resigning, but every Monday morning it's like
Tell me about it!
Well then just stop! We will just leave! Let's stop all!
This seems attractive.
Oh, I could never do it.
Oh, but you could.
You can.
Absolutely!
We can help each other!
We can get - what are these - these patches!
We could be like Patch Sisters!
Oh you know, we really should stop smoking. Ok, let's stop!
Yes! Awesome! Give me those cunts! Give the! Give the!
My late husband gave me this lighter. I am not joking.
OK then!

I'm divorced! I'm only 26 years old and I'm divorced!
Well, maybe it's a contest, you see? Like, collect the five?
Does anyone want to see?
Nooo!
Oh, hey, do not do that! Cut!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, it's so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a fault!
Big deal!
As if Joey creaked endlessly, his joints were not boring?
And Ross, with his over-pronunciation every word?
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
I mean, what's this thing?
... I accept all these faults, why can not you accept me for that?
... Does the snap of the fingers disturb everyone?
Well, I-I could live without her.
Well, is it a little annoying, or does Phoebe shave her hair?
Oh, now, do not listen, Pheebs, I find that endearing.
Oh, you do, do you?
You know, there is nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"Indeed, there is none" ... I should really go back to work.
Yeah, otherwise someone could have what he ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out and the gloves go away.

Awww! Mel Torme is dead.
Joey, this paper looks like a year!
Aw! Does this mean that the
Hey.
Hey.
Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure?
Well no. But, I bet she probably does it.
Probably?
Yes, I do not like that word.
A little what "probably" means.
Yeah, huh.
Yeah, oh, "Your mother is probably not going to kill herself," you see?
I'm sorry, but I do not dare to hope that Rachel and I live together "Probably!"
You know?
You must take care of yourself!
In
Bing does not seem so weird now, does it?

Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to greet his future wife.
Ohhh! Wow! It takes your breath away, does not it?
He is a guardian. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
May I just say that I really admire what you do. I lift it alone.
Oh, I do not do it alone. I have Ross.
Oh, of course. Now. But what happens when he meets someone and gets married?
Well, he gets the divorce, it's Ross!
I tell you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say that they will be there until they found their true family.
Well, it will never happen with Ross.
Oh that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my child spends the weekend with his father, the twins and the little Ms. New Boobs.
Okay.
And Tim, I just want to say, good luck here.

Hey. Who is it?
New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
They will have their baby!
It's not fair Ross we came here first!
Just after you left, they took her to the delivery.
Oh, but not before, she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie crowing.
Wow! Sorry. So, how are the new members?
Phoebe?
Yeah?
Look at this guy out the window, wow!
He is terribly small and I think he is talking to himself. And to be quite honest, he is not so good at bed.
Oh, what's wrong with me lately?
I mean it's like all the guys I see - I mean, look here.
Look at this guy, for example, I mean, normally, this is not a person who would seduce me, but for the moment, with what I feel, all I want is to rip off his sweatpants and his banana bag.
Wait a second! It's about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yeah.
It's completely normal, around the fourth month, your hormones start to go crazy.
Really?! So it happened to you?
Oh absolutely yes!
Oh, and keep in mind, now I was wearing triplets so, you know, in medical terms, I was three times more excited.
Wow! That explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store, sitting on Santa's lap.
Yeah. Yes, I remember trying to steal Evander Holyfield's cardboard cutout at a

Ugh!
I do not know what I'm going to do!
I called the company that sent and they do not care!
Then I called 9-1-1 and they made fun of me. If it's not an emergency, then what is it?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
And the guys at work had a lot of fun.
You know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
Yeah!
And-and another had never been to a party, so
So, uh, this wedding ring, huh? Dude, that's nice!
Yes indeed!
I was uh, I thought I might want to take one of these babies for myself, I might want to have one
This ring? When my grandmother arrived for the first time in this country, this ring and her clothes were all she had with her.
So, you could say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh absolutely! It's been part of my family for generations and every wife who has wore it has had a long and happy life.
So, you could say, it's a magic ring.
OH MY GOD!! I did not believe it so much that you did not say it !!

Of course, only one of us can continue to go out with her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now let's look at this objectively, I think I should go out with her
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
It's interesting, but look at this. I date
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
OK OK. It can take a while.
Yeah, we should order food then.
No Joey! Listen, why not, why do not we let it decide? Okay? Hey hey, we're going
It seems right.
Maybe I'll take him to this new French restaurant down the street
Oh yeah, wait a second now!
We will have to set an expenditure limit for the date.
I do not have the money to take him to such a chic place.
Well, sorry, that's what I'm doing dates.
All right, I guess I'll just have to do what I'm doing dates.
So let's decide on the spending limit
Yeah. Uh, a slice of six dollars?
I thought about a hundred.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?

Hello again.
Hey!
Hey!
Thank you so much.
Oh, do not thank me, thanks the moron who never showed up. Ok, I have to go to work.
You want help with that?
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No, I do not do!
Whoa! Are you OK?
Phew! Remained standing, I had a little head forward.
It's the heat. And-and moisture.
It's a difficult combination.
Do you want to come for a lemonade?
As if you did not believe it. Wow! It is a splendid place.
What do you mean?
Do you remember how you said you were really dense in poetry? Oh.

Oh!
Hey, someone left his keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Transcriber's note: Oh come on!
Who would leave the keys of their Porsche behind?
If I had a Porsche, I would have the keys attached surgically by hand!
Hey Gunther, yours?
Yes, that's what I drive. I earn four dollars an hour, I saved 350 years!
Na-uh! Hey, did anyone lose their keys?
Joey, why do not you put them in the lost and found items?
Is there a lost and found? My shoe!
You left a shoe here ?!
Well, I did not realize until I was at home.
I would not stay here again with only one shoe!
You know what?
I'm going to get that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh well, when he comes back for his keys, I will not fail to give him your shoe.
Awesome! Thank you.

Ok, and here's Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he will not sleep.
Carol, we've had that experience before, okay?
We have a good time.
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Do not be so surprised. I am an adorable person.
Oh it's very cute.
Oh, I got it for him.
My moms love me. It's clever.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Ju - Hi, Jew!
Huh huh?
Huh huh?
Okay. Uh, of course, that would be great.
So see you.
Goodbye.
You just said hello, Jew?
Yes. Um yes. It was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yes, he likes that. Reaffirm his faith.

Now here it is! I would not want my best guest to tire my eyes!
Thank you Monica!
Does this smell bother you?
What is Joey's smell? No, I can hardly feel it here.
Well, let me know if you can, because you know I can make a pie to cover.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay!
Okay.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Oh! Hello? Yeah it's Phoebe. Really?!
Yes, then it turns out that it was not the straightener that started the fire.
No, no, it was the candles.
It's really not good to leave candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you at the fire school is Uhh Uhh Ok.
Well, I have to go now.

Joey offered me.
Is he crazy ?! You just had Ross's baby!
Well, I said yes.
What?!
Are you insane?
You just had Ross's baby!
It's so inappropriate.
No, it's worse than that.
It's wrong.
It's ... bigger than mine!
I know.
You can not marry him!
Why not? I do not want to do this alone! And he's an adorable guy and he loves me a lot.
Well do you like it?
Sure.
Sure?
Yeah, I mean anything.
Honey, the question is ... do you really want to marry Joey?
No, I do not do it. Could you be a dear and go tell him?

So you were married, huh? What happened? You have just separated?
Here is the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
I want to wear this everyday.
You are so Beautiful.
I am so happy for myself.
Hello?
Hey! Is Chandler already here?
Yes, we got it back. Everything is fine.
Damn it!
Uh, what do you know?
I'll tell you who it hurts!
It hurts the kid who is robbed all his clothes in gym. He must go to the office of the principal with a protective glove!
It was
I will be! Listen, I do not want you to teach this to my son anymore. Okay?
Well.
Well, but I'll let you know that once I told him that, he called me Funny Aunt Rachel.
And I loved to be Aunt Rachel's fun but I will become boring and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel again if that's what you want!
No, that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you were linking up but I
Look, he does not have any brothers or sisters, someone will have to teach him that!
And I did not teach him anything that a normal 6-year-old does not know!
Shit!!
I have to go!

Look at this! Look at this! They go to the first class salon! Do you know what they have there?
No.
Neither do I! We must enter!
Act as if you belonged.
Oh my God! Oranges!
Hush! Nice to see you again.
Sir, can I see your tickets please?
Yes of course.
I'm sorry, do you want to move your thumb? I do not see the seat number.
Oh it's ok, I memorized it. It is 1A.
Okay. Mrs. Green! Ok I'm really sorry !! I apologize for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm

Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How does the birthday girl feel?
I feel good, but I think you disgust the rest of the children.
What?
Okay!
You know what?
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and children.
All I really needed was a plan.
See I want to have three children
Oh, let me guess, and you want to have them all at the same time and you want to have them for your brother.
As I said, I should probably have the first of three children at age 35, which gives me five years.
I like this plan!
I want to marry this plan!
You spent a hundred dollars. It's the limit. You're screwed!
Uh, actually, I sent the flowers before the exact date. So technically,
Oh oh! So that's how it's going to be eh? Yeah, I can break the rules too!
Oh yes? What are you going to do?
I do not know.
Why am I not surprised?
You know what Ross? I will not let you get away!
I do not think you have a lot of choice.
Well, we'll see!
Bye!
Yeah goodbye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Yes. Yes. Just here and there.

Dad?
I am here!
Hey!
Hi. God, it looks like yesterday you were coming to watch me work.
Dad, we can not believe you're selling the house.
Well, it's time for a new family to start her memories here and I hope her check will be cleared before finding the crack in the foundation and asbestos in the ceiling.
Let's take our business and get out of here.
I'm sorry, we can no longer store your childhood stuff.
Oh, it's good, I can not wait to see you again! All memories
Well, I do not know what's in the boxes here, but I know there are six or seven
I used to
Yeah, not as much as you enjoyed playing with a raw dough eater.
Hey, it's unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a

Ok, the duct is open.
Hi my name is ben I am an employee of the hospital, Ben. It's Ben ... to the rescue!
Well, are you ready?
Okay, give me your foot.
Ok, on three, Ben.
One two Three.
Ok, that's it, Ben.
What do you see?
Well, Susan, I see what seems to be a dark vent. Expect. Yes, it's actually a dark vent.
Phoebs, it's open! It is open!
Expect! You forgot your legs!

Your resume is very impressive, Mrs. Green. I particularly like what I see here about setting up a new filing system.
Thank you.
Deposit system?
Oh oh!
You mean those little colorful labels that you put on all the folders?
This certainly illuminated the interior of the binders.
Well, they ... they do more than that.
I notice that many important responsibilities have been assigned to you.
Yes, Joanna has really been an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel was really amazing with my morning bagel. It's amazing how she almost succeeds
I-I-of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh yes, well there is coffee too. Rachel can wear two things at once!
Yes it's very good. Much of this work involves maintaining personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that
And Rachel should not have a problem with that. The only problem is maybe a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
I like working with designers!
With them, beneath them, what's the difference? Hey, Rachel?

Chandler, you have an assistant, right?
Did she call? You told him I was sick, did not you? Always tell him I'm sick!
Chandler, listen to me honey, I know you can do it. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yeah! Okay, maybe you do not have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try, let's try to look sexy.
Okay.
Or not.

Where is Chandler?
I am here.
Wash your hands !!!
How did you know?
Hey! What is she doing here?
Relax, Ross. It is not made of ice!
Hey, look, Phoebe. I arranged the states geographically ...
What happened in Atlantic City ?!
Chandler and I are in a bar
You did not hear me say, "Du-ude ?!"
And that girl's eyes on Chandler, okay?
So after a while, he goes to her and, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
Now, I know what you're thinking about, Chandler is not the type of guy who goes to bars and gets out with girls, and you're right, Chandler is not the kind of guy who just goes into bars and who does not care about girls
You kissed a guy? !! Oh my God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very nice guy.
Oh my, I laughed so much
Ho-ho, so hard that we had to throw your underwear again?
Whatever the guy, you kissed a guy.

So, are you going to stay with me as long as I need you?
Of course I am!
Oh mum, I swear I'm not an idiot.
I read all kinds of books about pregnancy and childbirth, but I did not think about reading about what to do when the baby was coming.
And then guess what?
The baby is coming and I do not know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
Honey, it's okay.
Wait where are you going? Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Okay.
Now do not worry! Everything will be alright.
he
Hey!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I'm from Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not a sexual thing. It was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.

Ok, the reason I asked you to take brunch today is because I'm thinking about who should be my bridesmaid.
Oh my God! That's it ...! I really hope it's you!
I hope it's you.
Me too!
First of all, I love you so much both and you are both so important to me
Okay, blah-blah-blah-blah !! Who is it?!
Well, uh, I thought maybe we could develop a system in which we would exchange bridesmaids for each other.
As hypothetically, if Phoebe was mine
Yes!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
Again.
If Phoebe was my bridesmaid
Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's, like we'll all do it once and no one would get upset.
Yes, it's a very good idea.
Yes, I will do that. So who can be yours?
Well, it's the best part. Umm,
Why is this the best part?
Because then I do not have to do it!
Good of
I really do not decide!
Well!
Yes, it's true.
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!

If you want to give Joey a Christmas gift that disturbs the entire building, why not give her something more subtle, like a wrecking ball or a small pyre of fungal pills to free up the hallway?
It's not just the drum sound.
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
Oh my god, my eye! "
I mean, it's so annoying.
Yes thanks. You see, that's how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Phoebe, do you have Joey's battery to annoy Rachel, so she would not want to live there anymore?
Maybe at a certain level.

Joey? Could you get it? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, I'm coming to get you for our appointment. These are for you.
Oh, Lilies. Joey, they are my favorites. Thank you.
And a brownie!
Well, half a brownie.
In fact, it's just a bag.
The flower shop took a long walk and I started to feel bad, so
Oh man!
It's awesome!
In fact, I feel like I'm going to a real date!
Although I have a hint of morning sickness, I wear underwear that goes pretty much over there.
Hey come on now, it's a real date.
Uh, it's a nice place you have here.
Foosball, huh?
Pizza box.
Oh, a subscription to
Yes, it's actually my roommate.
I would like to meet him. He looks like a guy standing up.
Oh yes, but he's very protective of me, so you better look at yourself.
Ah, so is your roommate handsome?
Hm-mmm.
Oh yeah, it must be hard to keep his hand, huh?
Yes, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
No-no-no-no, he is not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!

Can you believe what Ross was a fool?
Yeah, I know. It can be really competitive.
Ha. Ha, ha.
What?
Oh, hello, kettle? It's Monica. You are black
Please! I'm not as bad as Ross.
Oh, please delay. the
It was
Oooooh. : Oh! I had an interview! I had an interview!
Well, do not play raquetball!
He forgot to leave his handle size!
He did not have the glasses!
Looks like you have problems.
Good bye Baby.
Ciao, Bela.
Do they wait for me to do that?
So are you going to tell him?
Why should I tell him?
And if you do not do it, his mother could do it.
Oh...
What are you guys doing here?
Uhhhh .... he does not even wear a jockstrap!
... what did I ask?

God. I feel violated.
Did anyone else feel that he just wanted to take off the skin from his body, have something else to do?
Ross, ten o'clock.
Does it feel like two.
No,
What?
There is a beautiful woman at eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten o'clock!
Oh. Hello!
She is incredible! It makes the women I dream of look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go see her! She is not with anyone.
Oh yes, and what would be my first line? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.
Oh come on. It's a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she
He could never have a woman like that in a million years.
Thank you my friend.
Oh, oh, but you know, you still see these really beautiful women with these guys really nothing, you could be one of those guys
You could do that!
You think?
OK, that's enough of the sight. Look at this, look at that. Sit down, sit down.
OKAY.
It's good! Helen, could you come here for a moment?
Thank you Helen, that will be everything.
The last time I do that, I promise you.

I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh-huh.
And I'll cook whatever you want here and I'll do anything in it!
Yeah you go! And you do not care about me ?!
Come on Monica, this is our Valentine's Day. Please? Please please please?
Okay.
Okay.
So, are we going there?
I am!!

Wow!
It's actually in the manual.
I can not go out with you or have a hot plate in my office.
I can not believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I appreciated that you defended me. It was really good. It made me a little more like you.
I know, I know that I really love you too. But we can not go out together. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Wow!
What?
Hearing that you describe as forbidden, it's really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well I-I-I do not care about the heat it does - it's uh, it's wrong
Stop that!
No! No! It's wrong! That's-it's-nasty. It's taboo.
Close the book!
Let's get a hot plate too!

Rachel, you're in a good place in your life. Come on, you have a good job! Good friends
Yeah! If-if when are you going to get married?
Oh I'm not, I just like trying these.
I do the same thing.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married on July 25
I'm kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
So when are you going to get married?
Oh May 15th
Oooh it's getting closer!
Yeah!
So who is your photographer?
Jeffery
We met him. Did he show you the pictures of the nude wedding he did?
The best man? Wow!
I know! I almost canceled my marriage. Oh, who is your group ?!
Oh, my fiancée wants the Swing Kings.
Oh, you are so lucky. My fiancée wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Ooh, is it written with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It does not matter they are both great!
Oh you know what?
You know what?
Now that you know what you want, you should go to Kleinman's and do it at half-price.
This place is so expensive.
So, does that come in another color or

I tell you, in a few years, schoolchildren will study it as one of the biggest first dates of all time.
It was amazing!
We could be totally ourselves, we did not play any games ...
So you already called her?
Tell him I like him?
What are you crazy?
It's the next day!
How much do I want to appear?
I'm right, right?
Oh yes. Yeah. Let her hang.
I can not believe that my parents force me to find one of you.
Oh, my God, do it! Call her! Stop being so testosterone!
Which is also the real treat of San Francisco. I have his machine.
His answering machine?
No, oddly enough, his leaf blower picked up.
So, why did not you say anything?
Oh no no no no The last time I left a spontaneous message, I ended up with the phrase "Yes Yes".
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, not everyone is watching at the same time!
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Okay, they just talk ...
Yeah, does he look upset? Does he look like someone who just told him to push anything?

So, what are you doing in life?
Well, uh, in the last few years, I'm working ..... which is funny because it was not even my middle finger.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot without you.
I thought they could ... I will try to come back as soon as possible. I am sorry.
Now it's funny.
Hey, do you think ... that it would be too weird if I invited Carol to join us?
Because she is, she is alone now, pregnant and sad.
I suppose.
Are you sure? Awesome. Carol? Do you want to come join us?
Oh no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on.
These people will go down.
You're going to squash, are not you?
Let's try scooching!
Come on.
Come on.
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches grade six.
And Kristin, Kristin ...... does something that, oddly enough, was not even her major!

Okay.
Okay.
When I was six years old.
Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel.
And instead, my parents bought me that little plastic chicken on which you jump.
It was embarrassing; the children were making fun of me.
It was a pretty difficult year.
It's awesome!
See?
I already feel that I know you a little better!
Thank you.
Ok, come on.
Now we can go eat.
Let's go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!

Do you want to choose one, just choose one! Here, what about that one?
It's patio furniture!
So what, as if people were going in and thinking, "Uh-oh, I'm out again?" Of course!
What about birds?
I do not know, the birds just do not say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
You choose one.
Okay, what about ladybugs?
Oh, forget the birds, but the big red insects suggest a fine dinner!
Very good, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I will not do it! Kip would have liked birds!

Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?
Bijan for ... Hey, Annabelle, uh, listen, I was wondering if after work, we could go for coffee.
Oh, in fact, I have some projects.
Ready, Annabelle?
You bet. Maybe another time?
Hey, it's not the first time I've lost a girl because of a cowboy who sprays cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men ?!

It was amazing!
Phoebe and Gary are
It was great.
We are the hottest! Huh?
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
I
Hi guys! What did I do?
Hey Joey! Is not it the girl who beckoned you the other day?
How are you'?

So, what are you going to do?
What can I do? A person wants to break, you break.
Hey, no question! Come on, you guys are, call her and solve her.
Oh come, we just had this huge fight, okay, do not I have to wait for a moment?
Hey, it's not like swimming after eating, pick up the phone !!
You know that all this swimming history is a myth.
Yes, tell my uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, he really believes in it.

It seems that your uterus is ready to be implanted.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Okay, so what's going on now, get the eggs, put them in there.
Well, it'll take a little time to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? Like in, "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five in fact.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We do five because it gives you a 25% chance that at least one is getting attached.
That's all! 25 percent? This means that it's as if 75% of the chances of not having a baby at all!
Hey, you know, I was wondering, what are the chances if-if, if you have 200 like that?
Sweety, now, it's a woman, not a rubber machine.
Ok, well you know what, do not worry guys, because I-I'm going to do that as many times as I need to do it right.
Well, you see, the thing is, we only have what we have, we sort of have a chance to do it right.
Uh, it costs $ 16,000 every time you do that.
So, uh, we use a little bit of all the money we have to do it this time only.
Whoa !! It's okay, it's a
No I am sorry.
Wow! You really do not know anything!
I know! Why do not you get drunk? It worked for many girls in my high school.

Sorry. So how are things with Joey?
Oh just great.
He is now behing me with codes.
One is, "Bring me food."
Two: "I'm with a girl, bring us some food."
Three is "I am lost and I can not find food."
Hey! Are you okay?
Yeah! She's right there!
Oh great. Hey! Go take off these pants, they look ready!

Hey!
Hey!
You have something to eat guys? I just went to Johnos for chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry there but everything was raped. So we closed it!
Pheebs, if this guy does not stop closing all our favorite places, where are we going to eat?
I do not know, clean places?
Hum, yum!
It's Danny.
Do not let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We will be there! Can not you say it starts later?
What? What kind of regatta gala starts at night ?!
The wrong kind!
Hi, I need a ladle. You have a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thank you, we see each other at the party.
Okay! Great!
Hey, guys, do you know what Larry would say? He said: "A ladle".

You are so effective. I love you!
Let's go!
No no no! We need something old!
Oh, great, I have a condom in my wallet since I was twelve.
It's going to work!
I do not think so.
Ok, now we just need something borrowed!
Here are just this.
It's flying!
No, we will report it! Just put it under your dress.
Ohh
Ok, one thing at a time.

Sorry about that. So. What have you done?
Oh, not much. I have a job.
Oh that's great.
Why are you so tanned?
Oh, I went to Aruba.
Noooo! I lie. I'm so drunk.
Oh my God, oh.
Great, Monica, you know, you could have called, I came here, I'm worried ...
Monica? Monica!
Rules of the water!
Yes, yes, it is. Ok, listen, the restaurant called, they want to know if you'll come to work?
Nope. To go to the
Ok Monica, what are you doing? You will lose your job! It's not you!
No it's me!
You know, I'm not just the person who has to eat the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they arrive!
You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that.
I am Monana!
Hello? Yes, wait a second, please. Monana is for you, credit card people.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thank you.
What?
They arrested Monica.

Note the pictorial lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and generally outside, his elusive subject being in the light.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain thinks of monster trucks!
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
I come ...
I wrote it phonetically for you.
Phonetically?
Yeah, that means ... you know? We just ... we do not have time for that.
Okay.
Ok, but you know what? I must say that I am really impressed that you could memorize all this so quickly!
Ah! I am an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week, during "Days", I had to say "frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Sensational. what
No idea!
But the guy I told to die in the next scene so I guess it means "you're going to be eaten by a bear".
Okay! Let's move on to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to emphasize the anxiety of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! Not ad-libbing and dude, you can not
Come on! you...
No!

Oh. Oh oh.
Hey! What happened to you? Why did not you go up?
Completed!
You just finished?
Well, I wanted to be thorough.
I mean this - this is clearly very, very important to you, for us!
And so I wanted to read each word carefully, twice!
So, uh, right?
I am sorry.
Does he do it?
Does he do it? Does he do it? Yeah, I wanted to give all that separate just another look.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said you read it twice!
Look, you know what, whether or not, and if you even
No, Rachel, no. I do not do I do not do
Are you sure?
Oh, of course! I am on.
I know.

You got married again.
Yes.
This is your second marriage in two years.
Yes, second in two years. Third in all.
Ross, I've been a divorce lawyer for 23 years and I've never had so much to do with one client.
Why do not you tell me what happened?
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
I'm sorry, did the same Rachel call you to the altar at the second wedding?
Yes Yes Yes! But I do
Oh, it's better then.
It was just a drunken mistake and I need to cancel it.
I see. Have you considered a therapy?
I think the
There are some forms to complete.
Easy.
And we will need witnesses to testify that you were not sane.
No problem.
And we will need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ooh!
There is no way to do that without her?
Because I'm ready, I told him it was already settled.
No!
Okay.

Phoebs owes $ 7.50, Monica, $ 10, and Rachel, 15 big.
But hey, thank you for teaching us Mary with crossed eyes. You have to play this at our usual game.
Well, here is my $ 7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Oh, I cursed him. So now, bad things will happen to the one who spends them.
It's good, I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.
In this way, I can break them with a movie.
Well, all that's left is the big green poker machine, which owes fifteen ...
Ah! Huh?

Do you want to do it now?
Awesome!
Ok, I just want to be really safe this time. Andie McDowell is the daughter of
No No No No No No It's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from
Oh yes. Ok thank you.
You are welcome.

is for me not to see you anymore.
It's crazy!
You can not do that!
What are you going to tell him?
Oh my God.
Ohh, you've already accepted that, have not you?
It's awful, I know, I mean, I feel very bad, but I have to do it if I want my marriage to work.
And I do it, I have to do
Ohh! I'm lucky! Oh my God! This
You have no idea what a nightmare is. It's so difficult.
Oh yes really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Well, let me simplify your task.
What are you doing?
On the way!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yeah, well that's how I'm angry !!

These little women. Wow!
You like it, huh?
Oh yes! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I do not see how he could forgive him.
Umm, Jo is a girl, it's a shortcut for Josephine.
Chandler.
Hi.
Hi.
Joey.
Eh eh!
Hey.
It's Monica.
Whoa!
And it's Rachel.
Hi!
Whoa !!
I am going to get coffee.
Hey, how are you doing something?
We do not really.
So, now, do you have a lot of big plans?
Oh yes! Yeah, no, we'll connect, you know, and everything.
Yeah, I thought maybe we could go to Time Square and look for some ninja stars.
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a bitch.
You know, we do not really enjoy life in the city.
I know.

Ok, Chandler!
Okay.
And your horoscope says, "The fifth, a special person will give you a present."
Oh, thank you in advance.
Op, but the twelfth brings the spat of a lover.
Oh, wait and the 19th, a secret crush is announced.
Hi guys!
Hey !!
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!!!!!!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So, are you excited to fight crime with the help of your robot?
Am I excited? Lead in my own TV series? I've been dreaming for years! Why do not I get ready ?!
No! Joey, you'll be great!
But I have to play with a Pheebs robot, and-and I do not know anything about technology!
I can not even use Chandler's computer, except to find porn!
And-and that's only because it's right there when you turn it on!
I think our lover's spat will begin earlier this month.
I'll wait.

We are at the last minute and I apologize for the mess. Okay?
Oh my God! It certainly did not look like that when I lived here.
I know!
Now, look, there is only one problem though.
There is only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Well, since the fire was a bit my fault, I guess you should be able to stay here.
Hey! Hey, hey, now it was nobody's fault, Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Well no, it was my fault, so you should have the nice room.
Okay!
So Rachel!
You are the first guest at the Monica hotel!
Uh, you just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.
And I thought I'd bring them to you, you know, in bed.
Oh, you have gone through so much.
I have.

This is just Bactine. It will not hurt.
Sorry, it was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Why not just put "poor little Tooty" in the lobby?
During a power failure? He would be trampled!
Yeah?

Well, I want you to know that it may happen that I'm not there, like that.
But I will always come back like that.
And sometimes I can be away longer, like that.
But I will always come back like that.
And sometimes, I want you to steal third place, and I'm going like that.
He is so amazing.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Ben, Ben, hi Ben. Nothing. I do not think it's his name.
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he opens his eyes.
It does not do much, does it?
No, that's about it.
You want to have a coffee?
Yeah.
Okay, see you later.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Come on, they'll love you.

Here you are.
Oh my God! It's a six-hour pill! That's all! I came out of the wood! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
Oh, it's like a huge weight has been lifted!
Because look, no hair loss, no rash, no hives, I'm so happy!
Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.

Well, thanks for the lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I did not pay, I thought you paid!
So, apparently, we are not paying for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
How was it?
Had the money in the wrong hand.

Okay, I'm going to steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility to make sure nothing happens to him?
I will do it.
Who wants it? Anybody?
I said I will do it!
Nobody wants to do it? Okay, I'll do it myself.
Monica! I will not ruin everything!
You know what?
You're right, I'm sorry.
In fact, you have been a big help tonight.
Yes, and thank you for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure that she is at the hotel.
Of course, that's why I'm here!
Okay. Sorry.
Ugh! What grandmother?

Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today, is that correct?
Yes, at 4:00.
Ok thank you.
That's it.
Expect!
Expect!
Have you seen that?
This mail did not know that something was happening between us.
You saw my huge pile of porn, right?

Hi Monica, it's Chip.
Yesss !!
Who is Chip?
Hush!
I'm giving you my good shots at the bank today, so here's my number 555-9323. Call me. Later.
Chip, it's Chip Matthews.
The guy who took Rachel to prom? Why is he calling you?
Because I met him at the bank, he is still too cute.
Monica, you are so lucky! He is like the most popular guy at school !!
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay goodbye. Oh my God, we just had
I had just left.
Well! Because I have a report on the product to read, it's about eight pages, I hope I do not fall asleep.
Why? Have you written it?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Well, actually ...

Here is your tea Phoebe.
It is so good. Oh thank you.
Well.
I'm glad you liked it.
Oh!
What?!
What?! She made tea!
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
You what?
Oh my God!
I like it. She sees smart.

I have no idea, could be. Look, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oh no problem. You were worth the wait, and I'm not just talking about tonight.
I actually
: Yeah, well your friends are in violation.
I've been a nice guy so far, but uh, I do not need that grief.
I will call the owner and tell him that Monica illegally sublets her grandmother's apartment.
Your friends are out of here buddy.
Why do not you tell me something I do not know!

Okay! I found the right one!
You know what they say, on the 23rd
Who's is this?
Oh that's important! All that matters is that you are so beautiful.
Oh, damn it!
No! Do not say that! Do not say that!
Damn it!
No no! Go back to repeat!
Damn it!
Oh shit!
Oh shit!

Hi Rachel! Hey, do you mind if I read my comics here?
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are there and it's a bit difficult to focus.
What?!
She just called and said she would work late!
She continues to lie to me!
That's all!
You know what?
I'm just going to go there and confront them now!
So Chandler, I'd love to come tonight.
Really?
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, about seven o'clock?
Yes.
Well. I can not wait for you and me to have sex.
Hey hey, take a look! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Oh yes! Oh my God! It is
Yeah, that's it! Naked Ross !!

You know, hey! You are the one who finished, remember?
Yes, because I was
You always love me?

Noo! May be! Me, I do not know.
What?!
I come, I feel, I - I come ...

I won! It was my neighborhood!
Well! Right here! Take a hike toots!
Excuse me sir! This lady played my neighborhood, it's my money.
Is that true miss?
Sells drugs to children.
What?!
She sells drugs to children.
It was my neighborhood!
Was it his neighborhood?
Why not talk about it during dinner?
Ok lady, you are out of here.
No! No, you can not stop me! No!! I will not go back! I will not go back to this hell !!
I'm just taking you outside!
Oh ok.

Hey!
Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that can make you want to stay married. We register and
No!
Ross, come on!
No!
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about how to tell you this, and the bottom line, Ross, is that we can not stay married.
I do not know if that's true.
Oh b-b-but that's the case!
Oh, ok, do you know what it is?
Oh Ross, come on! It's not, it's not a wedding !! It's the worst hangover in the world! Ross, listen, if
Okay. Okay, I will do it.
Thank you. Hey-hey uh, uh, is there, is there such a thing as a cancellation shower?

Hey! What are you guys doing?
Hey.
Make holiday candy for the neighbors.
Yes!
So, did I really ever win again?
How much have you really won before?

He is so cute. So where did you grow up?
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
How, how did this happen?
Oh my God.
What?
I suddenly had the feeling of falling. But I am not.

Thank you.
It was very nice Ashley.
No no.
So, is it my turn now?
I am next!
Oh!
Obviously they do it.
What?!

Ok, I pause, I go through the window.
No no no no! I waited like, always, to go out with Lorraine. Relax a little.
Calm down? Calm down? You prepare me with the woman I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Can you stop shouting? You make me nervous and I can not go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go for it !!!

Hey guys, guess what?
The British arrive?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since Christmas I will be part of these gifts of collection.
Yes, I already have my bell and later ... I get my bucket.
Ohh
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be there to spread the joy of people.
I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not enough.
So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was
I can not
Oh! Look, the time is up! My turn!
It was half an hour?
It's your timer.
You know, I do not like boasting, but I give the
Okay, so mass me nice!
Ah! Ahh !! Ahh !!
It's so good, is not it?
It's so good that I do not know what I did to deserve it!
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Farewell muscles !!

Oh whoa-whoa-whoa!
Wait a minute, open your hand; Let me look.
Quarter.
Dime.
Plush?
Not interested in that.
What is this?
A Canadian coin?
Get out of there!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
No drinks near the bucket!
Put it there and then you can contribute!
And you can also let the injured rabbit look there!
Hi Bob!
I thought I told you to get out of here!
Phoebe, we had complaints and we will take you to a less known place.
Well, because we thought you knew !! It's so obvious! My God, it would be like saying to Monica, "Hey, you like cleanliness."

Hi Joe! Do you want to shoot hoops?
Oh no, I can not go. I practice; I had an audition to animate a new game show.
Oh cool!
It's awesome.
Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day, I'll be Dr. Drake Remoray, but in the evening I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
You will be perfect for that! It's already your name!
But the audition is in a few hours and I do not even understand the game.
Do you want help?
Oh really? That would be great! You can be the candidates!
Impressive!
Okay, I guess we can lose once again to high school girls.
Okay! Let's play Bamboozled!
Bamboozled?
Yeah, it's not a cool name?
Yeah!
No!
Oh. Ok, just breathe.
Oh honey, I think I have one too!
Look at this! Here we are!

Excuse me. Hello, I am a teacher here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, pile 437?
Well yes! Give me just five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No! No!! No! Can I talk to someone in charge please ?!
How can I help you?
Hello, I was wondering if it was possible to increase safety in the paleontology section?
I see that I have written a book there and instead of reading it, people are-well-being, rolling in front of them.
We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
But in terms of strengthening security, I'm afraid the library is understaffed.
I, I can not help you.
Well.
Well!
If I am the only person who appreciates the sacredness of writing, I will go and defend it and defend it myself!
And do not follow me!

Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant or in his shower drain?
Oh my God! Phoebe looks, it's Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look at this! It's a line of ants! They work as a team!
Phoebe!
Yes Yes.
Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
Uff, I hope he drops it easily.
Let's go.
Go Phoebe, look at that!
They do not separate, look at them.
Ok, you know what it is?
It's a second date, that's it!
Look at this, she just put her hand on her thigh ...
Oh no! It's really nothing, she's
Ohh! Phoebe, it's all your fault! Now he loves her, he's going to marry her, and it's your fault.
You know where I work!
I do?
The movie theater, you came all the time.
Do you still work at the multiplex?
Oh, as if I was giving up this job! Free popcorn and sweets, when I want. I can have free posters for your room.
Thank you, I'm ready. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh yes, but I can stay out as late as I want.

Beautiful car!
Yes, it's not mine.
I like your car
Yes, it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do you like leather seats?
Yeah!
He has them!

Joey, please!
Sorry.
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Hello children!
Hey! Do you want to play table football? Please?
Okay.
No no no! We have to move the table to my room, yes! Because of all the boxes. Come on!
Okay, I have a question.
Farewell to the little puppet Joey?
No, calm!
You mean that?
Um-hmm! Listen, I-I-I do not know how much more I can bear! Did you know that he registered on my
Look, you know, maybe it's hard, but it's Ross! I survived college with him!
Okay, I guess I can hold a little longer. Let's have a game
Okay.
No no no no!
YES!!
Uh guys,
Ok, so he came out of here.
Ok, you know what, because you said that, I'm not going out tonight.

I know it does not make much sense
A lot
Look at Chandler, it was instinctive! Okay? I just went for that!
So you risked your life for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler is the best sandwich in the world!
So you did not choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You are like my brother!
Really?!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you count for me here.
Thank you.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
That's good?
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?
Mm-hmm.
Oh-whoa-hey, man, what are you doing ?!
I thought you were showing me how much you meant to me.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!

Look at the ring.
Pleasant! A half-carat easy.
Hi.
Hey hey Pheebs!
What?
Chandler will ask Monica to marry him!
Oh I know, I helped choose the ring.
Did you tell him before telling us?
Well, she came in when I was looking at the ring's brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?

Let's see.
The Congress is debating a new bill on deficit reduction ... the mayor still wants to raise metro rates ... today, he peaked at forty-five ... and, oh, the teams have played sports.
And for Glen? He could be a Glen.
Nah ... not special enough.
Ooh! What about Agamemnon?
Waaay too special.

Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I ?!
Wow! Pleasant! Manly and also a kind of slut.
You see, I'm starting to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh-huh.
The silk? Feels really good!
Oh yes, sorry for that.
It's okay. Come come.
Thank you for letting me stay here! I mean, Monica's house was nice, but her fiancee is watching a lot.
Oh.
Oh my God! You make a good Chandler!
Uh-huh. Yes, I have a talent for impressions.
Well, maybe after we get to know you, you can do it.
Yeah no !!

Hey! Guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess what work I had.
I do not know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer to be black.
What?
Blue blazer at the back. He wants to get it back.
But you said you black. Why would he want his black blazer?
Well, you know what I meant.
No, you ruined everything. You are stupid.
So, what job did you find Joe?
Oh, ah, guide to the museum. Yes, Ross got it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, do not you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
I just walked into the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like a torture!
You know, if we ever go to war and you're captured, you'll have a
It only gets worse!
You know?
I mean, it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate friend, which I think she knows.
Because every time we are in the same room, there is this strange energy between us.
And call me crazy, but I think she loves me too.
And now I saw her naked.
I mean at least when I saw her dressed, I could imagine that her body was like covered with drums or something.
But there are no barrels, it is smooth!
Smooth!
Wow! Could everyone see her dress?
Yeah! Oh my God!

So you and Angela, huh?
Yes. Rather.
Oh, that's what she meant!
You know, if they shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!
You know, museum abbreviation, and avoid confusion!
Yes, most is a place
Ok, all right, I'll take him to MET.
Yeah, uh, all right, there's this big, rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.
You know what?
She likes architecture, you know what you should do?
You should take a fifth stroll to St. Patrick's Cathedral and there is this great little pastry she would like.
Definitely, it looks like you should go on that date!
But I am not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you're going
Okay.
You have to tell me exactly what to do there.
Ok, when you enter the museum, turn right is the wing of antiquities.
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, to the Byzantine Empire.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and do the right

Hey!
Hey, so everything went well with the cancellation?
Oh, yes, no problem. Everything is taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Hey, you want to go see a movie?
Oh yes, why not?
Pheebs?
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Ok, I'll get my sweater.
Okay. Do you want to hear something weird?
Always.
I did not have the cancellation.
What?!
We are still married! Do not tell Rachel. See you later.

Hey! Are you OK?
Fabulous.
Listen, drama critics are nothing but people who have not been able to become actors. Do you know what you should do?
Exactly. So you did not say anything to Issac, did you?
I say everything to Issac.
You say, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hello! You know we have not met yet ...
You dog!
Yes, I guess I'm a dog. But Issac, I see that I have a girlfriend.
Oh yes, this coffee Rachel.
Yes, that's it. Listen, I do not want to hurt her.
Oh, hey, man, I know, no matter how much we love them, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information for yourself?
Aw, no problem guy. You know we have to look at each other. We are the same, you and me.
In fact, no, we are not.
Yes we are.
No we are not.
Yes we are.
No we are not!!
Ok, we are not.
Right.
But we are.
Well. I just need to know you will not tell your sister.
I can promise not to tell him anymore.

Emily!
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
I have just seen you again before you leave.
You're so sweet.
It's a big chocolate bar. (She is holding one of those huge
Me too.
Well, it's me. Here, have this. In any case, I am entitled to only one copy.
Wait, listen.
I-I, I have to tell you something.
Uh, I thought, I'll just go out and say it.
Okay?
I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Oh. Thank you.
This is not a problem.

Monica!
She sleeps.
I know, just a quick question, a quick question. Which one was
Deep impact
Sorry, I just can not sleep.
Ooh!
Where is this book that you read with the two women who were skating and wearing hats with flowers on them?
Because every time I look at this blanket, I'm like
It's in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking the real estate section, um
Yeah?
Look at this.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house.
Oh, there is even a tree with a broken branch in front and uh, the window in the attic is Oh my God!
!
What? What happened to the attic window ?!
I can not believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I can not believe they - they did not even tell us!
I can not believe I still do not know what happened to the
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I have just seen the house in the newspaper! Yes we are surprised! With whom did you leave a message?
Sorry!

Good then
Nothing?
Look, you and I have received a gift.
Okay?
We have to do something with that.
Like-like, modeling by hand!
Huh?
Or-or magic!
And you
I have to go back to
Whoa!

Whoa-whoa!
We could have our own show!
You know we could clap our hands, people will love
Huh?
And-and-and I wrote a song for us!
(Singing, to the air of
Its good.
But you did not even hear the chorus!

Well, she'll understand, right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Dad, it will not matter to her.
Look, all my stuff is dry and safe and all his are, is growing, new things!
You see, that's exactly the kind of thing that makes you think that you love me more than you like.
Oh my God, does she really think that?
Well, can you blame her?
Well I do not know, I-I guess we were able to favor you unconsciously, you were a medical wonder! The doctor said that your mother could
Dad, dad, I do not want to hear about it.
Really?
Well, not now.
Ok look, Monica came here for some memories and damn it, we'll give her some!
Ok, grab empty boxes.
Okay?
We will take things in mine and everything we can do for us, we will put them here.
Awesome!
You know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could?
Yeah! I have sailed all my life. When I was fifteen, my father bought me my own boat.
Your own boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.

He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Count in our heads as good
I guess I'm done.
The pleasure is over!
Wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's always fun and it means something!
Uh-huh!
I think I'll take off.
Guys, the rules are good! Rules help control pleasure! Ohhh!

Japanese noodles dehydrated under fluorescent lights ... the fact
Question. You do not go out with anyone, because I met someone who would be perfect for you.
Ah, you see, perfect could be a problem. Did you say "co-dependent" or "self-destructive" ...
Do you want an appointment on Saturday?
Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny
It's a he?
Well yeah!
...Oh my God.
I just thought it was good, Shelley.
I'm just going to throw myself in the toilet now ...
Okay goodbye...

It's official, there are no good movies.
Well, let's go to a bad one and go out.
Maybe you want me to turn around so I can hit my back.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey, man. What's up?
Maybe you can tell me.
My agent would like to know why I did not attend the audition I did not know today.
The first good thing she has won me for weeks.
How could you not give me the message?
!
Well, I'll tell you I like guilt, but, oh, it was not me.
Yes it was! It was him! Uh huh! Ok, it was me!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.

Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy who has a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There is this kid in my class who said he was in love with me.
Whoa!
Whoa what?
Ross has a boyfriend.
I do, I do it
Really?
Yeah!
I do not know.
I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
What-what-what-what is it ?!
Do I give a kind of sexy teacher atmosphere?
Not immediately.
The fact is that my natural charisma made him fail midway.
Oh, now I feel bad for the kid!
Once I had a crush on a teacher and it was so difficult!
You know, I could not concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
I mean, come on, you remember what it's like to be 19 years old and in love.
Oh yes! Thank you so much! Oh, that's how the French drink it.

A new pair of shoes for Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Yes! I have never seen a roll like this in my life!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?

Choose a number! It's yours

Thank you!
If you get this one, we buy everyone here a steak!
Yes I understand.
Take as much time as you want.
Ten or twenty minutes if you need it.
I will be there.
No smoking.

We're really going to do that, huh?
It looks like it.
You know, if, if it's too weird for you, we can always come back
J? have understood!
Okay.
Susan! Hi!
Hey!
Thank you very much for coming.
Oh, I would not miss that for the world.
I am -I am Ross by the way.
Hello Ross. I like what you did with this space.
Thank you so much.
It is hot?!

Guess who is here. He's the hardest guy in the country of toys, Ben. "A true American hero. I am
G.I. Joe
Ben looks, it's a toy that protects US oil interests abroad!
It took me 28 years to find a man with whom I want to spend my life. If I have to wait another 28 years, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's stupid.
That's what's stupid.
I do not need a real man, just two of his best swimmers.
And there are places where you can go for that kind of thing.
Again on the docks?

Hi. How much, how much ah, did you sell?
I'm not gonna tell you! You are the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Hey now! It was an accident, okay.
You are a big scrud.
What is a scrud?
Why do not you look in the mirror, Scrud.
I do not have too much. I can just watch you.
Very good girls and man. Let's see your final account. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, fine.
Not nice enough.
Charla, 278. Sorry, darling, but good.
So how are the lasagna?
Really?!
Well.
So you owe me three pretty things.
Yes, I thought a lot about you too.
I know.
It's difficult all this platonic thing.
It's a word!
Yes, I think it's better that way. Yes, we are smart. Yes I am sure.
Are you really sure?
I'll call you back.

So, are you really going out with this nurse?
Well, uh, you and I just laugh, I thought, why not gambol with him.
You know, I do not know if you've ever looked at the term in the dictionary doing stupid things. spend more time together.
But if you have this new entangled dictionary that makes you hard, then we have to get my original dictionary.
I am
I think you're better than you think.
Really? Good then
Know when to stop.
You know, I felt I had to stop. So, it's OK?
Yeah. Okay, I'll tell Dan that it will not happen. Do not dance.
Right!

Ow! -Ow! -Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! You know, ow!
Hey! -Hey! What is going on?
She broke my arm.
He touched my fanny.
No, she touched mine first!
It's my job!
Are you British ?!
No more now.
Why are you shopping here? You do not live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party is barley?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends are not as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Who's the party?
A woman's
What woman?
Chelsea.
Ok, you know, one of two things is happening here.
Either you see someone behind my back, which would make you the biggest fool on the planet.
Or, you pretend to see someone, which makes you so pathetic that I could start crying here in the grain aisle.
So, which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be this guy?

Beautiful story again! The threads you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
You know, actually I should go.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-should-you-should-stay!
Sensational. Oh, I'm really flattered, but I do not feel that for you.
Oh no-no-no, it's not-no-no-no!
You just whipped me?
OK, you would not let me finish and I was just- [Monica rejects it] Ow. It hurts [plays Monica]
Oh! Okay. Now, do not do that!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
OK, now I'm going to kick ass.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
I know! I know! I know!
Okay, now I'll let go if you both stop.
Well!
Well!
There we are. You know what, if you were in prison, you would be like my dogs.
Ok, buddy. It's here. You hide my clothes, I wear everything you own.
Oh my God!
Look at me! I am Chandler! Can I
Yeah.
Whew, it's hot with all that stuff.
I ah, I better not do it, I do not know, splits.

Hi.
Hi.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry before.
I do not need a game room.
I mean, when I was a child, I only played these games because I could not have girls, and now I
Stop Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Really?
Yeah! Oh yes!
Ohh
Listen, we do not have to make it a bed and breakfast, we can think of something that concerns them together.
It's a good idea! we can
Totally!
We do not have to come with that now.
Oh good.
Yes, and I agree to be a breeze.
It's awesome. Good for you guys.
I am not very demanding in maintenance!
I'm not a child's play!
Who said you were?
You did it!
Oh, I'm flaky. I will say anything.

Ok, I know it's going to sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do it, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, I can not do anything more.
It does not seem stupid to me.
You know, it's like the first time I had to get ready for dinner after Carol left?
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
Next on Ross ... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the laundry is over.
It is a song.
The laundry song we sing.
Uh-oh, the laundry is finished, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross, what's the problem?
Nothing nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry is finished.
Why are you here?
Well, Sid and I are still trying and we had problems last time because apparently we ...
No no no ... I mean,
Oh! Someone is a little grumpy today because they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the size of a child.
What!?
It was fun! But I have an invasive vaginal exam to do!
I would love to stay, but I ... had a date ...
Leave, please! Let me know if you need a hand!
I think it just fell.

I do not want to be single, okay? I just want ... I just want - I just want to be married again!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel ?!
Yeah.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us on a ride and I will not let them do it!
And we are not a couple of suckers!
I hear you, Mugsy!
But look, all these rooms are okay?
Can you just pick one for me to watch - have a magical and perfect weekend with you.
Okay,
Nothing! It's finish! Shit! It's a regularly scheduled program!
Can we turn off the TV? Okay? Do we really want to spend all weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I disturbing the change of room?
Hey, do not blame me for stirring tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bellhop who had to drag the luggage to 10 different rooms?
I do not know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada with a half tank of gas!
Do not talk bad about the dead.
We are supposed to spend a romantic weekend together, what's your problem?
I just want to watch a little TV. What is the big problem? Definitely, relax mom.
What did you say?
I said, "God, relax Monnnnn."

You know, maybe it's better that we never have to do it again.
Yeah, it makes a little special tonight. You know, technically we still have
I'm going to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you later?
'Kay!
Can I ask you something?
Uh no
Felicity and I are watching
No.
I mean, the giant is five years younger than me, do you think I'll get there one day?
Yes.
Thanks dude.
Ok dude.
But how is he bigger than me?
I mean, I can not get bigger now, see?
And who knows what science will be developed in the future, if not Chandler, that if I die dead, a man of normal size without success?
Hey, Monica, you've been in the bathroom for half an hour.
I know!
Had the pieces of beef, huh?

Goodbye and good Lord, let's hope Brady.
Not so fast Wesley!
Remoray!
That's right Wesley! I just came by to say that you are not a real doctor! And this woman's brain is fine!
Oh! Thank God!
Hope! Hope!
Duck!
You do not die Hope, you will live long and healthy. With me.
Oh Drake.
Okay!
Here we go!
Okay!
Hi Joey!

Yes, of course, I can bring sandwiches.

OK, we had the cabbage salad, we had the rolls ...
We have the flesh of cows and turkeys that were once cute, ew ...
The men are here.
Mom, do you want to relax?
It was 10 blocks from here and the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that.
Mom, come on, stop worrying.
It's a safe street, it's a safe building, there's nothing
Hi.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Um, no she does not, but I can, I can send her a message.
Awesome. Uh, just tell her that her husband stopped.
What?
How did you do that?

Okay, someone.
OK, I'll go there. OK, last year of college ... on a pool table.
Whoooaa!
It's my sister.
OK ... my strangest place should be ... the women's room on the second floor of the New York City Public Library.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Pheebs, what about you?
Oh ... Milwaukee.
Um ... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, "It's a small world after all".
No way!
The carousel broke down.
So Carol and I went behind two of these Dutch mechanics kids ... then they repaired the car and we were told never to return to the magical realm.
Oh, Rachel.

Hey!
Hey!
Oh, the play is over?
Yeah. Where have you been?
Thank you for your patience, you are the next interlocutor.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must go crazy.
Nah. I found things to do.
Oh, ok, yes. I put your things in his room and his in your room.

Well, there is the past. And uh, you know, yesterday.
Yeah no, I tell you Rachel has such an eye for things like that.
Ross, you know if you decide to redecorate one day, and I think you should do it.
You should ask Rachel to help you.
Oh honey, he does not need my help.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of it, how did you call it? Cheap imitations and junk food from dinosaurs.
Really?!
Hey, you know what?
Since you have such a good idea of ​​what I need, uh, here's $ 60 billion, why do not you take Phoebe at your Colonial flea market and get something from me.
You know what? I do not think Phoebe really wants to come.
No! I want!
Oh, she really wants.
She wants.
Yeah!

Wow, you really have beautiful feet.
These old things.
Would you like to spend time in my Siadic region, it is killing me today.
You mean by-okay by siadic, you mean the part covered with a towel.
Yeah.
Of course, yes, no, I can do it, yes, because, uh, you know, the muscles of the Siadic region can be very beautiful and tight.
So, tell me Rick, how did you hurt the area?
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Oh.
Ow! You just bit me?
No!

Uh, that's it.
No.
Hey!
You!
J.
Crew member.
Yeah.
Why are you?
I mean, all week long, wherever I look, there is you.
You would not return my calls, you returned my letters ...

One more chance, Ursula, please?
Okay.

Ok, and then it's coffee. This is where I play my music.
Good deal.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Hi!
Hi! Okay, let's go shopping !!
Uh, you know, before leaving ah, there's something I have to say.
Oh ok.
I had a bit of that ah, that crush on you.
But since you were with Ross, I - I did not do anything about it.
But now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you to go out someday.
That's what I'm doing now.
Wow! Umm ....
I dropped a cup.

Hello, little embryos.
Well, I'm Phoebe Buffay, hello!
I-i-I-I-hope to be your uterus for the next nine months.
You should know that we are doing this for Frank and Alice, you know you've been there already!
You know they want so much from you, so when you go, grab him.
Okay, and-and I promise to keep you warm until you're ready to take them home, so Oh!
And also, the next time you see me, I scream, do not worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
Ready?
Uh-huh. Good luck.

We are baack!
Hey!
What are you guys doing together?
Joey and Janice
Really.
Yeah yeah.
We went to a game of Mets, we had Chinese food and you know, I love this woman.
You have a competition buddy.
I just gave you a kiss, I have to go get the baby, then.
I'll see you later darling, you too Chandler.
You still can not stand it, do you?
I'm sorry man, I'm tired, I really did it.
Well, you know, I appreciate you trying.
But, listen, you know the good thing is we spent the whole day together and I survived. What is even more amazing is what she did.
It was the day of the bats at Shea Stadium.
You told him to play gay boxer !!
Well, I might have said supergay.
You totally screwed him up.
Joey, you're the teacher of this guy. I mean, how can you do that?
Because, Monica, the guy is so good, and I really, really want this part.
Well, if you really want it, then it's okay.

We then have to wait for data from recent MRI and MRI scans that challenge the information gathered during simple carbon dating years.
Look at this woman sitting by the pool sunbathing ... so hard and wrinkled, I'm so
I am not your brother.
What about my Drake kids ?! Huh? No!! No!! No! God!
Why not try to massage the chest to stimulate the flow.
I hope you are joking?!
It's so frustrating! Why does not she want my chest ?!
I do not know! Maybe she's crazy!

Hey Joey, I have some beer for you.
Uh, you do not want to say "for whom?"
Of course, listen, I'm going to order a pizza, do you want to share one?
Pizza, heh, it's not like I've never had this before ... ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is anything wrong?
Okay, okay, let's talk about it openly, okay?
You are hot.
I am adorable.
Clearly, there is an atmosphere between us.
But we are roommates and it is a big mistake for us to continue on this path.
Joey ...
Oh no it is not, no it is not. It's a first date. I am
Oh.
Ho-oh, he'll get some!
From the lamplight of his apartment.
You know, um, he closed the curtains so he could have a nice conversation with your little sister.
Well, I'm going to bed!

You were so funny with this server! You are a nut!
You know, fangs in bread sticks are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You are the funny!
Uh, look Katie, uh, listen, we have to talk.
Okay?
Uh, look, I love you.
I-I really like it, I love you a lot.
Okay?
But sometimes, when you give me a punch like that, it feels like someone is hitting me with a very small but very
Aww, as if I could hurt you. Do you make fun of my size? Do not make fun of me because of my size!

Oh, Joey! Sorry!
They made you the head of the department!
No, I'm going to teach one of his advanced classes! Why did not I head the department?
Oh! Hi Rachel, listen
Yeah.
I have a big date, do you know a good restaurant?
Uh, Paul's coffee. They have great food and it's really romantic.
Ooh, great! Thank you!
Yeah! Oh, and then you can take him to
You're sure to name a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell you
Ooh, I miss dating.
Gettin 'all dressed and go to a fancy restaurant.
I will not be able to do this for so long, and it's so much fun!
I do not want to say that staying at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen-pound baby is not fun.
Hey, you know what?
Huh?
Why do not I bring you?
What?! Joey, you do not want to go to an appointment with a pregnant woman.
Yes!
And we're going out, we're going to have a good time and we're not thinking about deliveries, caesareans and giant baby heads
Okay! I come with you! I go! I come with you.
I will be fun.
Okay?

Hi!
Hey!
Joey, I have to tell you that I thought
Oh, you know, the writing was good and the director is good, and ... and my co-star is good
My God, you must tell me what will happen tomorrow!
Ow, I'm just reviewing the script now! Do you want to read lines with me?
Me? Oh no, I'm not an actress.
Oh, okay, I can ask Monica.
Oh, live, this part is mine!
Well ... ok, so just at the top of the page, right here.
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
I can not believe you married him.
But what choice did I have? He kept my sister in a
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
It's finish! You
How can I?
Knowing that I will never hold you in my arms, that I will not touch your skin or that I will not feel your lips, knowing that I will never make love to you?
How can I accept that ...
I will never be able to kiss you again so that's all I can do to not kiss you now.
Kiss Me.
What?

Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you have the biggest half. What did you want?
The largest half.
I would like to propose a toast.
Toast here, ding ding.
I know it's not the kind of Thanksgiving you've all planned for, but to me it was really great, you know, I think, because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you were going to Vail, and if you were with your family, if you did not have syphilis and all the rest, we would not all be together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very grateful that all your Thanksgivings have been void.
This is so cute.
And hey, here's an ugly Christmas.
And a new year of shit.
Here here!

Now, wait!
Wait!
Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now you can tell her that I will be at this airport and I hope she will be there too!
Oh yes, I said Rachel's name, but it did not mean anything, okay?
She is just a friend and that's it!
That's all!
Now, just tell Emily that I love her and that I can not imagine spending my life with someone else.
Please, promise me that you will tell him that.
Okay, I'll tell him. Go face fuck!
Call me.
You spend half of your life in the bathroom, why do not you go out by the damn window!

What happened?!!
Well, I do not know !!
We fell asleep! That's all.
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. All right, I'd better go.
I think it would be better.
Yeah. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Okay. But not about it!
No! Never! Never! Goodbye.
Not touch! Not touch!

Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I have some bad news. I do not think I can move to Tulsa.
What?
It's a funny story, actually.
I fell asleep at the meeting this morning, so when I said I was moving to Tulsa, I did not really know what I was saying.
You fell asleep?
But only because I stayed up all night worried about this meeting, is not it funny?
Irony?
Not a fan, okay.
You see, here's the thing.
I went home and told Tulsa about my wife and she will not leave.
See, I love Tulsa!
Tulsa is paradise!
Tulsa, it's Italy. Do not force me to go!
Chandler, I ...
No no no!
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
Why should I call you Elaine?
Oh what a beautiful picture of your son, bloody!
It's a picture of your daughter, is not it, she is adorable.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.
I will call you from Tulsa.

Hi.
Hey.
How are you?
I'm not too bad Fortunately, blue is my color. How did you know I was here?
Because ... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card that you used.
That I did not expect.
I want you to know that I did not give you back.
Oh. Thank you.
No thanks! You gave me so much! I mean, without you, I would never have sung
In fact, you only have to sing "Memo-".
I can not believe you're here.
I mean, what will I do without you?
Who will be partying at the embassy with me?
Who will take me to
Uh ... Oh, Mindy, you're so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Familiar smell?
Oh no.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
No, I'm so sorry ...
Oh my.

Well, it's impossible for me to be vaccinated.
Maybe they can take the needle and inject it into my mouth, like a thiffirt rifle.
Doctor, can I see you for a minute, please? My brother has a slight phobia of needles.
Did you tell him about my Thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the doctoral student, would like to know if there is a way to deal with this orally.
No, in these circumstances, it must be an injection and now.
Tho?
Ohhh
That's good, sit down.
The doctor says it must be a needle.
You're just going to have to be brave, okay?
Can you do this for me?
Okay.
Okay. Oh man. You are doing so well. Do you want to shake my hand?
Yes!
Okay.
Okay, Ross, do not hold on tight.
Honey, really, do not squeeze so hard!
Oh, Ross!
Let go of my hand!

You will love me so much. I have Sting tickets !!
Oh my God! I really love you! How did you do?!
Well, let's just say
Oo, where are the seats?
Uh, the middle balcony.
You are a nasty old woman.
No! Wait no! Shut up, I mean do not cry! Let me get my checkbook!
Look honey, you do not have to do that, okay?
It's the strength you have inside that matters most to me.
You are loyal, honest and honest!
That's the kind of strength I want in the man I love!
It does not mean anything to me. Come on!

Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Hey.
: What are you doing?
Ummm. Oh! I am sorry. It's a little old but
: No! You are in the process of fouling the chute that I spent half an hour to unclog!
I am sorry. I did not come here a lot.
: Oh yes, of course not!
No.
: Because you are a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza, dad, buy me a candy factory, Daddy, do the casting of
I never said that.
: You think you could do some damage and the big man in combination will come here and clean it up, huh?
Well, why not think of someone else to change?
OK I am sorry.
Hi!
What is this?
Oh yes it's the phone number of this girl.
Yeah, yeah, that's it, just a phone number that a very sexy girl gave me.
It does not matter, I mean, it's his home phone number, but ... Whoa!
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost that baby!
Yes, the beautiful Amanda gives me her number and I will drop it.
Thank you.

I do not know how one of them opened ?!
You have them all open?
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler will never trust me again!
Oh hey! You have the gift of my parents!
Yeah. What is it?
Well, I do not know. I think it does something to salami.
Hey! How did it go?
Yeah. What did Tag say?
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
I'm doing Rachel. I do it and I am so happy for you.
Oh wow, you did not even try to pick up my bra!
So, are you ever going to tell anyone?
No, I'll do it I'm not going for it tonight.
Hey Rach, listen, no matter what this guy says, I want you to know that you will not be alone in this situation.
I'm not?
Listen, I ... It's a scary world, especially if you're a single mother.
You know, I always felt like you and I have this special link.
You know?
So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
Thank you.
If I can not have it you can not have it!

I can not believe it, you know, it's so typical.
Now, Monica, I know you're angry, but do not forget.
There will be a wedding, you will throw the bouquet, and
Paris?
We are going for a moonlit walk on the rue de la.
Continue to speak.
Then we will sprinkle pink pedals on the bed and make love. Not only because it's romantic, but because I can!
I love you!

Yes!
I win again!
Ha-ha!
It's like $ 500 you owe me!
Whoo-hoo-ho!
$ 500 is a lot of electricity!
Whoo-ho-ho!
I have to buy food.
Ok, give me a chance to get my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $ 1,000.
Are you serious?
Oh yes!
Ok, get ready to have me!
Okay.
Ok, here we go. Ready?
No! No! No! Nobody can beat me.
See? Now, that's the reason why only the fake men are supposed to kick.

Who is it?!
Do not worry, I'm brave!
I am courageous!
I am brave!
No no no no!!
Can you tell me who is there please?
Hi!
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
It's candy time! My roommate says they taste like small drops of paradise.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Small drops of sky.
4:00 AM IN THE MORNING.
So, can I have candy?
I'm sorry, but some of us have to
Uh, listen, I'm sorry, but I'm going out early in the morning.
Okay, I'll go later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.
Mm! Looks like I would have remembered you!
Mm! Night Gar '!

Aaron! You must let me go. The guy is hammered!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and aware that we're still shooting.
You would not have a very big fork?
So, uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Well, have we finished the scene?
Yeah! You were wonderful.
As you were.
So I have your car, it's just outside.
Why? Are we made for the day?
That's what you told me.
Oh thank you. You are welcome.
No no no! We must go! Come on! Here we go.
Is it my ass?

What about these? These are alike?
Absolutely!
Not like the others!
Oh, so no.
Hey!
Hi!
You're ready?
Yeah.
You are very beautiful. I am the luckiest man in the world.
Ohh, you're about to have a little luck.
Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings
They have a beautiful look! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really tastes good!
Thank you for choosing the man with the earrings.
Hm-mmm.

I know there is no hole there, I really liked this picture.
Oh my God! Look at this!
Okay, but here
I do not care! The threads are loose in your head!
I just thought that if I could follow the thread, I could find what he did.
And do you have ?!
No, he disappears behind this plinth. For a minute, I thought it was going down.
But that was not the case. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.
Hello Darling.
Hello, Madame Chatracus.

Ok, is everyone clear? We will pick it up and move it. Now, all we need is teamwork, okay? We will
Ross, I really do not think
Elevator!! And slip!
Ok, here we go.
All right, lift up! And slip !!

Ok Carl, we are next. Now remember, what is not going to be?
Another
It is true! And what are you not going to do?
Well, I'm not going to talk because
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never go away completely, but
Oh my God, I-I understand.
I-I'm so sorry, I'll go.
Goodbye Monica, I wish you a happy life with him.
Chandler, you call me when it happens in the thief.

Yeah?
I found my identical twin!
Ohh, you are
No!
But she's coming up here!
It was Joey!
I wonder where she is. It's so weird.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Do you want to stop that!
Do you want to know the first thing she said when she came back from lunch with Richard?
She did not feel anything for him.
She loves You!
Really?
Yes! Now she feels very bad! She really wants to wear makeup! You must find her.
Okay.
Well. I really should start wearing hats!

I mean, why should I let them meet him?
I mean, I bring a guy home, and after five minutes, everything is on him.
I mean, these are coyotes that kill the weak limbs of the flock.
Listening
As someone who has seen more than his fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: it's not such a bad thing.
I mean, they are your friends, they watch over you.
I know. I just wish that once, I bring back a guy at home that they really liked.
Well, you realize that the chances of that happening are a bit thinner if they never meet the guy ..

No no no no. Hey!
In any case, I should go there. Okay goodbye.
Hey darling.
Hello Darling. So what was there with all these whispers?
I can not tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people are not supposed to have secrets between themselves. We have too much love and respect for each other.
Awww. But still no.
No, I'm serious, we should think
Really? Ok, so why do not you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at
Oh no-no, I can not do that.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Okay.
Okay.
So, Ross and I are going
Oh my God. He vomited?
No, he visited a small town in the south to vomit. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's former massage place is fired.
That's all?! I gave up my
It is true! You lose the sucker !! Please, marry me again.

Ahhh! Ooh good!
My God!
Oh hey! How was your hearing?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just training to get rid of you because I'm going to be a big movie star!
Oh! You got it?!
Well no, not yet. But the audition went really well.
What was it for?
Oh, it's this big budget movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America at the turn of the century.
It's really chic!
Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese.
The next next?
Yes, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, okay?
But then this guy is right after him.
Hi!
They loved me!
Oh my God!
I hope you are joking? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, all right, let me remind you.
What's the problem?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Wow!
I know! My grandmother will see that!
Grandmother will have to queue.

Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
What? Of course I did it! You sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
Oh uh, I could not remember everyone's name, so I-I'm a little bit nicknames.
Smelly von Brownshirt was on the other side of you.
Oh yes. So, uh, did you have a nickname for me?
Umm, no. No.
Yes you can! what was that?
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Ohh that's so nice!
Listen, I have to tell you I'm having a good time!
You know how, before you said, it can be weird, everything about the student teacher, and to be honest, I thought it would be too, but it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Burt!

Okay, so we still have some good releases, a lot of things to work on.
Ok, shoot.
Ok, uh, oh, zoo advertising.
I did not have it?
No, they said you were not credible as a human being. So, you can work on that.
Okay what else?
Uh, people on the Broadway scene said, "You were pretty, but stupid."
Oh.
Oh no, wait, I'm sorry, it's pretty silly.
Hey.
How is the maniac?
Oh, well, it's delicious. We made a little kiss.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not in this stuff anymore. He left for me.
Pheebs, this guy is obsessed with your sister, because God knows how long, okay, you're not giving up something like that.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Are you speaking about a guy who has night vision goggles?
What, he still does not follow her. Do you think he's still following her?
Pheebs, wake up and feel the restraining order.
What do you say I should do?
I think if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thank you Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he's going.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.

Hey guys check it out! My mother sent me the paper!
Ooh, see that!
Ahhh.
Ah!
She's not crazy, is she?
No.
So how are you?

Here it is!
Here is our star!
So, what did you think?
Almost as good as playing with the two naked girls on the swing.
I - I was not in that.
Wow, I have the wit of an old Indian woman living in mine.
So you know?
The postman was down, so I brought your mail.
Oh good. Thank you.
Now what is Fabutec?
Ok, ok do not judge me too much.
Okay?
Uh, but I saw this info-market, and uh, I swear I never bought anything on TV before, except for this broom.
But there was that kind of thing about waxing legs, it was so amazing ...
Waxine !!
Yes! Have you seen him?
Oh, it's amazing! I want so much to be a Waxine girl.
I know!!
God. Do you think it really does not hurt? Because how can they do that?
Hi! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rainforest!
They have the best things in there.

Comin 'through. Move moves.
Oh, excuse me. I used this machine a bit.
Yeah, well now you're a little not.
But I saved him. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, it's your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I do not see any foam.
What?
No foam, no backup. Okay?
What is going on?
Hi, nothing. This horrible woman has just taken my machine.
Your basket was on the top?
Yes, but there was no foam.
So?
Well, you know, no foam, no backup.
No foam? Excuse me, wait a second. This is my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, his things were not in there.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Because it's good money! But that does not change the fact that it is a perverse corporate machine that sucks blood!
Well, I think it's a good place to work!
Ok, they listen?

Varrrrrroom!
Hey!
Look at this lady!
Varrrrrrrrrrom!
Hey, look good!
Varrrrrrrrroom.
Okay, I'll leave.
My bed is so boring.

Ross, do you realize it's the first time in my life that I'm doing something that really matters to me.
It's the first time in my life that I'm doing something for which I'm really good.
I want to say.
if you do not understand that ...
No, hey, I have it, ok, I have this big time.
And I'm happy for you, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!
Ok, I do not know what to do.
Well me neither!
Hey!
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss something?
Joey stuffing 15
15? Your best staff! (Ross takes a
Where have you been?
Oh, an appointment. Yes, I met this girl on the train to a museum in the north of the state.
Oh yes! How did you meet her?
Oh, what museum?
No, answer his.
Okay, there was only him and her at the back of the train. I sat by the door. She had to go by if she wanted to change cars.
She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were tainting this woman?
No, I'm going down because she lives in Poughkeepsie.
She looks really cool, but she's really great, but she lives at half-past two.
How can she be great if she comes from Poughkeepsie? This joke would have killed Albany.
Completed! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?

No, there is no way! It can
Why your family
He can not play at our wedding!
I mean everyone will leave!
I mean come on, it's just noise!
It's not even a song!
If you listen very carefully, I think his

Oh, I want to watch too! . Yuck!
So do you think these images -Are they trying to tell a story?
Oh yes, of course.
I mean, as in the case of this young woman, she lost her clothes, so she goes naked on the horse, she shouts, "Where are they, where are they?
Well, she will not find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh yes. Aw, do you remember how long you went to the barn, lifted your shirt and bent?
Yeah.
You see, now I'm going out with this girl.
She's cute, she's out in the open, you know, and she knows how to make fire.
I mean, it must be useful
Ok, I have a question. If you had to choose one of us to go out with you, who would it be?
I do not know.
Neither do I.
Rachel
What?!
I do not know. Neither do I.

Listen, I meant I'm sorry for losing you
Listen, I have a secret for you. I let him win.
Is it a secret or a lie?
No, I let him win-Ross!
Yeah?
Do you want to tell him that I let you win, please?
Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler
I am strong! I will show you!
Chandler please!
Oh what's the problem? Are you scared?
Let's go big bunny!
Okay. 1 2 3-Go! I'm going to kill me!

Hey Ross, is Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten
Ohhh I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Wow! Do you realize that we are throwing this ball without dropping it for an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I understood it about half an hour ago, but I did not want to say anything because I did not want to send it.
Wow! We are very good at that! Hey! We totally forgot the lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think it's the first time I miss a meal! Yes, my pants are a little loose!
Hey guys
Hey!

Who is it?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey!
Oh my God. You make porn movies.
No I'm not.
You make one now!
And-
Yes, can I help you with something?
Look, I'm talking right now! You want to say it.
You know, twin things are always a real big seller.
What?!
Yeah, I can convince them to give you 30 bucks.
No!!
No way!
No!
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!
And shame on you all!
You're disgusting!
Especially you with that!

Hey!
Hi Pheebs!
You move?
No, they are not all my suitcases. This one is Paolo's.
Uh, Rachel, can we talk for a second?
Well, of course ... just a second, because Paolo is about to arrive.
Oh! Ok, uh, ok, uh,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs ...
Ok, uh, we have not known each other for so long and, uh, there are three things you should know about me.
First, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and third, I make the world's best oatmeal and raisin cookies.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have not I tasted them before ?!
Oh, I do not do them much because I do not think it's right for other cookies
Okay, okay, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.
I suppose not.
Paolo made a pass to me.

I am really sorry. Please, stop panicking.
I do not panic.
Why should I panic?
A woman named Heldi called and said we were going to get married, but that happens every day.
Honey, we were in this beautiful place, and I-I-I just entered our names for fun!
I mean, what's wrong with that?
Right here!
Chandler, please, do not think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
Phoebe and Rachel!
So the people who knew our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi and apparently a group called Starlight Magic 7 that are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please do not take this for nothing, because it is not.
Okay.
Really?
Yes, if it really does not mean anything, because you know I'm not ready
I know! I know.
Okay.
I'll tell Joey that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Hey, did she buy it?
Totally.
Did Heldi show you the place?
Yeah it's beautiful
I can not believe you're going to ask Monica to marry you!
I know.

No Phoebe!
You can not get the phone that way; it is not fair!
Ok look, I have an idea.
Why not see, what kind of number he has on his abbreviated number, and from there, we can say who has more in common with him
And then, whoever gets the phone.
Or, we can decide which name is closest to the word phone.
I do not think so.
All right, but I'll bet you sing another song if we fight for a ratchet.
Okay, the first name on the abbreviated number is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mother to suicide.
Okay, you can not use that to get the cute guy and the latest blueberry muffin.
Do I use it today? I am sorry.
Yes OK.
Well, now, see that it does not tell us anything.
Joe
Carlos
To fart.
Ooh!
Peter Luger!
It's a steak house!
Ok, a meat eater. Well, it's one for you.
Oh, I win! He has
So you do not know it's
His new girlfriend!

I can not believe. Do you think your parents could help pay for it?
I do not know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
She keeps the rest for her divorce.
And all the extra money my father saved for his annual trips
Well, what happened at dinner?
My parents spent money on our wedding!
My God! What did you order ?!
Wait, but there is no money! Well it's terrible! You will have to get married like a guy. center!
Honey, it's okay.
No! No it is not! It will not go well! That sucks! No swing group! No lily!
No, you know what?
It's gonna be okay.
I mean you do not need this rustic Italian feast.
You know?
And-and you do not need, you do not need this custom-made dress, empire-size, duchess, satin; you can wear off the rack.

Dr. Geller, there is a seat here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having lunch at this table in the middle.
I'm having lunch here, with my good friend Joey, if he stays with me.
I'm going to sit down with you Dr. Geller.
You know, we work in a natural history museum, and yet the way we have lunch has something wrong.
Now, I look around this cafeteria and you see what I see, I see I see the division.
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I wonder, "My God why ?!"
Now, I say we put on these coats that separate us and we get to know the people below.
I am Ross!
I am divorced and have a child!
I'm Joey! I am an actor! I do not know dinosaur squat!
I'm Ted and I just moved here a month ago and New York really scares me.
Okay, that's it!
Yeah, you hang out here Teddy!
I am Andrew and I did not pay this pear.
Ok, good, good for you.
I am Rhonda and it is not real!
Wow, Rhonda.
I am Scott
Yeah, all right, Scott!
And I have to turn on and off the light 17 times before leaving a room where my family will die.

So thank you for the warm welcome.
It's good to have you in my team and I come to play.
I hope you too.
Now, let's go and go get them!
Huh?
And remember, there is no "I" on the team.
Yes, but there are two in martini, so everyone
You! Chuckles! What is your name?
Oh, it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry, I was just ah ...
No-no, I heard what you said, funny.
I like to laugh.
This team requires a lot of work, but also fun.
Happy to have you aboard Bing!

Yeah. You will not be able to take it.
So uh, now this little Chandler turned out to be a girl, how are they going to name her?
They will call him Chandler.
It's a kind of male name, do not you think?
Work on you.

Oh, that's so nice.
No, no, all right, you hang up.
Ok, ok, one, two, three.
Well, you did not hang up either.
She did not hang up either ...
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, yourself,
Ross, hello, it's Rachel.
I just call to say that uh, everything is fine and I'm really happy for you and your
Rachel, I received a message from you.
Oh my God.
Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give the phone, give the phone, give me the
.
.
Are you on me?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Wha ... are you uh you are on me?
Oh oh.
When, when did you ... under me?
Basically, lately, I had, in a way, feelings for you.
OK, I need to go to bed.

Hey! I'm inside, they'll let me audition!
Really? It's awesome!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting women saw me in a play, so I avoided her
(noticing a child who picked up a copy of
Oh yes, yes! He made tons of advertisements. I saw it in Sugar Smacks,
Yeah, well, he's not going to get it.
Ben is a lot cuter than this kid.
I mean watch it, look at you,
It's awesome. Look, would not it be great if I had to play Ben's father?
Joey, you do not look like Ben.
I look like him more than you!
You know, I do not really know you enough so you can do that.

It was really one of your best jobs.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can not believe I only have two hours before calling sick to work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, you're not going to believe it, but if you have seven minutes
Really?!
Do you want?
Okay! You get the vacuum and I'm going to get the furniture polish!

Oh ok. But what do you know? Pay attention. Because a guy who helped me before had to leave because he had hurt his back.
Boyfriend?
No.
I am Joey.
Kristen
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Kristen
I got it! So
So, do you live here?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Just down.
Hey listen; let me give you a small tip.
Do not take a nap on this porch or you can wake up without shoes.
I'll remember it.
Okay. Yeah. Listen, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
But why not tomorrow?
Great! Okay, ok, where are you going?
You look strong, why do not I take that and you catch one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah. Yes, I will take this one.

Hey.
Listen, uh ...
I am sorry.
: Yeah, uh ... you know, you should forget what I said under the bridge, I was talking
That's right, I do not ... But I was, I was drunk!
Ok, yeah, so that will not work.
If so, would you stop going out with her?
Uh, so yes, it's because of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either she or me.
You know ... you'll be really, really hard to overcome.

By the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see much of me.
Oh, good morning liar.
Look, I'm so sorry for giving up on the bike.
I could have been killed I hope you know!
I know. I know. But can we please try again? Huh? I mean, you were
I would like, but the bike has been stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe
What?! What is going on?!
Okay, you know what?
If you're not going to learn to ride a bike, I'm sorry, I'll have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
Because! Because, it is, it's as if you had this guitar and you never played it. Okay, this guitar
Okay. If you care enough to make you pay that shit, all right.
Awesome! Awesome! You make the bike very happy.
Ok Ross! Please do not die!

How could you keep all this from me?
I was going to tell you, but
But what?! You thought you'd get what you wanted and let go of it like you dropped Rachel!
Hey! I did not drop Rachel! We are not together yet either. Can I just Why not let the machine get it?
Hi Ross. It's Joey. There is a whore here and we thought you might know something about it.
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I-must-I, I must lie down.

Everything about your application looks really good-Ohh!
Just one last question, are you and your friends going to be here all the time like to party and hang out?
Oh do not worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa !! Listen, do not just give up. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
You can call roommate search! Hi! I will live here.
Oh, do not listen to him, he's just a guy who really wants the apartment, but I do not think he'll get it.
Why did you lower the shower curtain?
This thing was a danger! I am very conscious of security.

Hi.
Hey man, how was the audition?
Estelle said I did not understand.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for that!
Yes, I thought so too, but she said that the cast people had problems with me.
No!
As far as I know, she tries to find me but can not because I'm moving around constantly.
No, from now on, I stay in one place.
Right here.
Well, it's getting late.
Yes, we will go there.
In fact, do not you mind staying here for a while?
You know, we have to get up early and fly to New York.
Yes, it's a very big plane.
That's great.
But we will stay here with you.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate that, you know, but you do not have to rub my buttocks.

Hi, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
They are not a couple!
Oh, ok, I understand the game now.
Ok, listen, let me ask you a question. When they did it on stage, was it really hot?
Oh yes!
Okay, so all is well.
The rule is that when two actors do it outside the stage, all the sexual tensions between them have disappeared.
Okay?
So, as long as it's hot on stage, you have nothing to fear.
It's when the heat goes away, it's when you have problems.
Really?
Look, you've been to every room I've played, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
No.
Noooo !!

Ursula! Expect! Uh, it's me! Phoebe!
Oh, I thought there was a mirror. Okay goodbye.
Wait a second! So what's up with you?
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm going to get married next week.
And your breasts! Hmm !!!
Okay.
Umm look, you come a little hard.
But I will give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems that the universe really wants to be together.
So why do not we do it again, okay?
And you can just tell me about yourself.
Okay.
Okay.
I write erotic novels, for children.
What?!
They are wildly unpopular.
Oh my God!
Oh too, you might be interested to know that I have a doctorate
Wow! You do?
Yes, a pretty huge
Okay.

So, how is she?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How are you, Mom?
Me? I'm fine, good. I'm glad you're here. ... What is your hair?
What?
What is different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She is amazing, our mother is ...
Ok, relax, relax.
We'll be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have a boyfriend and your career to cover.
Oh my God!
The little candies at the bottom of her purse.
Oh!
... yes, they were disgusting.
Oh, do you know what I liked?
His Sweet 'n' Los.
How she always stole them at restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from home.
May be.
You can not!
Why? Seriously, I did not understand a word you said.
In the hall.

Now, you see, most people, when their pets disappear, they want to see them as dormant.
But sometimes you get your person wanting them in a pose.
For example, running after their tail or jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I want to get my keys.
It's a good one!
Hi Joe.
Dad, Ronni is here.
Huh?

So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if you like what you want, we can make you a market.
Nothing at all.
But these are the three that Monica has pre-approved.
Thank you very much for hanging me up, Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as a guest.
I'm Monica's bridesmaid. Okay? Do not try to pin me!

Oh here, I think it's us. Yeah.
Limited sits my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
I am Monica Gellar. Who do you know about the bride and groom?
Used to work with her. Used to! I am a parent and I have not been invited! A
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.
So, what about you, huh? How do you know the happy couple?
OK you are well.

Monica, why did you bring me here from all sides ?!
You will see.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Oh my God.
Okay? But, but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and you know less bricks, and-and-and-flowers and candles
And the musicians, listen, they can go here, okay? And the chairs can face that way, and you go.
But, but if you do not like it, we'll do it elsewhere, at another time.
Really, it's good, whatever you want.
It's perfect.
And, I do not know, if it starts to rain
Well, we are going to get wet.
Ohh, and I do not even have a date.

To come up.
I have a bone to choose with you.
Uh-oh.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yes? Did he shoot the old
It is true! It is true!
Oh that.
Yeah that! You know I hate jokes! They are mean and stupid and I do not want my son to learn them!
You know what? It does not matter! Because it's not true!
Okay.
And if it was true, how
Mrs. Monroe Oh, that's it.

Mark is a genius!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Look, you do not see what's going on here.
Instead of flirting with him right away, he becomes his confidant.
Now he's going to be the guy she's going to complain about you too.
What am I going to do?
Well, why do not you send him a bug, op, no, you've done it already.
Well, look, you'll have to go yourself now, okay, make some surprise visits.
I do not know you guys.
Very well, do not do anything, stay seated talking to us and during this time, she talks to him about you.
And he's Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking, "Maybe he's the guy for me, because he understands me.
And before you know it, she's with him.
And you will all be, 'Ohh, man!'
And he will be everything, 'Yes!'
And we will be like, 'Wh-whoa, man.'
And soon, you'll be like 'Hhiii' and, and, and 'I can not go, Rachel and Mark could be here.
And we'll be like, 'Damn it, it's been four years !!'
He's taking a picture, is not he?

That's what I did for the party so far, as far as alcohol is concerned. Get a lot of alcohol.
Awesome. Awesome.
Okay, uh, regarding the guest list, I have you, me and Chandler, and I'm going to invite Gunther because, well, we talked about it pretty hard.
I will be there.
All right, oh!
Look, I know it's your party, but I'd love to see how many museum geeks are there.
Yeah. Say what, do not invite anthropologists, only types of dinosaurs!
Okay! We will need a package of six
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Hey, you know what, if you're going to do that, if you're going to call him Joey, you should call him Chandler.
Oh, come on!
Chandler is funny, sophisticated and very kind once you know him.
Well, Joey is adorable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, well, maybe he'll be a little late, but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you some cold soda, if you want, you need him, it's that you're really hot.
What are you saying? What are you saying?
I like the idea of ​​giving him the name of someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are big names.
But all right, maybe I'll only call it The Hulk.
I knew I should not have talked about it! That's what I wanted to call my child!

What Rachel did in her life ... We met her parents at the club, they did not play very well.
I'm not going to tell you what they spent for this wedding ... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
At least she was lucky to leave a man at the altar ...
What is it supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.
No it is not.
Do not listen to your mother.
You are independent and you have always been!
Even when you were a kid ... and you were chubby and you had no friends, you were fine!
And you would read alone in your room and your riddles ...

PBS telethon.
Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
I
$ 200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after which
Oh, I'm still mad at them, but now that they bring happiness to many children whose mothers have not killed themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
What kind of problem?
Well, actually, they had a problem with the bag!
Oh my God!
Nooooo!
You know what? It was a stupid game anyway!
You know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I do not want to give up the bag.
I do not have to give up the bag!
Am I Rach?
Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey, wait, Joey, I'm sorry, I mean as great as I think you're with her
Oh hey!
I do not know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can not believe I hear that!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I'm not saying you should not have a bag, but just-there are others who are a little less humble, controversial.
Yes, they are called portfolios.

I think you will find this room more to your liking.
Okay! Great.
They say he has only half a tank left.
A half tank? We still have a lot of high speed chases to do!
We change rooms again.
What? Why?
It is a garden view room and we paid for a ocean view room.
Our last room with ocean view was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me, can I speak to you for a second?
Uh-huh.
Chandler!
I hope you are joking?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey !!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey !!
Oh. Oh, did I wake you up?

Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was about to leave. I-I-I-I-I-I did not think you were coming.
Oh, I would not miss it.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Oh, you are such a gentleman. Come on! We go home!

Hey!
Eh eh.
So are the guys okay?
Yes, we talked and Monica made me understand that I had reacted too much and that some things in life are more important.
Do you have a minute?
Well yes, of course, what's up?
The guys asked me to go out twice today while I was at lunch.
Oh really?!
Yeah. Did you tell someone I was gay?
Oh, did not you want people to know?
But I'm not gay. And most importantly, I would not want you to think I was gay.
Why this?
I do not think I should say.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I do not want you to feel that you can not tell me things.
Okay.
'Kay.
well
Yeah.
I would love to ask your friend Phoebe.
Yes, she is gay.

Here you are.
Awesome! Okay, I'll call you later.
Awesome!
Hey hey! Who was it?
It would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Get out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things did not work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
No, it's okay with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, just after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Yeah yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a pizza myself!
Expect! You go out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you so pissed off?
Well, I'm upset for you. I mean, having sex with an endless row of beautiful women must be very unsatisfactory for you.
What is the big problem? It's not like we're exclusive.
Listen, Joey, Kathy clearly does not respond to your emotional needs.
But Casey, I mean, I've only seen the back of her head, but I feel like she's - she's smart, funny, and she understands you.
Do you have all this from behind his head?
Good listen, I think it's time for you to calm down. You know? Make a choice, choose a path.
Who is Elaine?

Can not you see me ?!
So, are you going to talk to him?
I do not know Rachel.
Oh, come on! I will give you ten free
A! No, ten! You said ten! You can not take that back!

Hey!
Hi!
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your TV?
We need a porn break.
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
So why not turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who have disabled free porn.
Ooh, well, you hear! Okay.
Hey!
Hi!
Well, what was it?
Oh that, well I'm glad you asked.
Now, do not you hate when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
Ahh!
Now, I know what you think
Pregnant woman kills four?
Phoebe, they did not charge you for those knives, did they?
No!
Are you sure?
No!
Honey, you will not earn enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
No, no, I know, but I just need to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
What is the second part of your plan?

Yes, it's true.
Why?
I'm tired of attacking two women, I did not work.
What?!
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, it's my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me have this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife ?!
Oh no!
No no!
No I'm tired!
But I could not.
That's why I'm here.
Maybe we could attack them together?
It's a no.

What? No! No, I do not stop. I am Red Ross!
Dude, if you go back, you'll be Dead Ross!
I do not care! I do not go! I insist to finish this game!
Okay, okay, if you insist on that, let me at least help you.
No, my God no! This is not a place for a woman. These guys are going to catch anything.
No, that's not what I say. I may know some things that could help you inflict pain.
I like this.
Yeah? Listen well, Devon has a weak ankle.
Huh?
A quick kick and he will go back.
Okay, bad ankle, understood!
And this big guy with the beard, he has a hip.
Yeah.
And uh, and David there, I heard he was not wearing a cup.
Yeah? I can use that, hip tip, no cup, all right! Okay!
And uh, Liam, Liam's knee hurts. You hit him on the right and he goes down like a lamp.
But, but, Liam is in my team.
I do not care! You just took it!
I will go get him! Okay, I'm coming home!
The Red Ross! Okay.

Oh! Oh, by the way?
Uh-hmm.
James Brolin?
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, Ed Begley Jr and him, and then I remembered he was gay.
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?!

Hello?
Hello, is Ross here?
Uh no, he is not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce attorney, just told him that, since I did not hear him, I guess he decided to try the marriage.
Ross remarried-Nooooooo !!!!!!!!!

Oh oh! Okay, she kicks!
Oh! She is growing in you.
Whoa !!
Oh!
Wow it was a big one.
I think it's the youngest girl to reject me.
Oh hello guys!
Of course, I can spend time until I have to meet you. What are you not going to go there?
I have a job interview for which I have to prepare.
I thought you already had a job.
And people say you are not careful.
No, it's a much better job.
It is the vice president of a company that performs data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that ?!
That's what I'm doing now.
Hey Joey, come and taste that.
What is it?
Do you remember that guy who gave me a bad review? Well, I'm avenging myself!
You cooked it?
No.
He teaches a course on culinary criticism at the New School, so before going to the movies, I want to go there and have him try my bouillabaisse again.
Oh, I can not wait to read one of the Post tomorrow!
"The restaurant critic admits: I was wrong about Monica."
The first page? You really live in your own little world, do not you?

So, did you find someone to marry you?
No, but the Horny Minister for Monica called to find out if we were still together.
We will never find anyone.
So let me do it!
Joe
No no no!
Listen, I thought about it.
I am an actor no?
So I will not get nervous talking in front of people.
Joey look it's really nice
No no no no no!
I will not spit and I will not look at Monica's breasts!
You know?
Everybody knows that I am an ass man!
It is true.
Yes, and most importantly, it will not be a stranger like this one who barely knows you
It'll be me!
And I swear I'll do a very good job.
Besides, I love you guys, and that would really mean a lot to me.
You know, we did not find anyone else.
It may be a little cool.
So can I do it?
Ah-ha! Too arrogant!

I still can not believe they took my key. You trust me with yours.
Yes of course! And I'll give it back to you as soon as they're done in the main square.
What is that?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
You said there was a gas leak here.
Why do not you use your key?
Because when I find it on this thing, the whole place could have exploded.
If this happens in another building that I manage, people will start asking questions.
Come on!
Hurry up.
Oh! We could have done it.

Fortunately, the guy she's settled for does not understand what you're talking about.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Uh, and maybe I'm wrong!
But you know I'm going out with him again, I'll find out more.
You think this guy is for someone else and you always go out with him?
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl must eat.

(walking with this
God Ross, what is it?
Oh, but it made her so happy.
The little girl misses her cat.
A mad woman thinks her mother is in a cat.
Okay, you know what, I have to go to dinner with my son, can I be sure that when you see Phoebe, you'll tell him?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I
He's right, is not he?
You know what, I think maybe it's one of the times he's wrong.
You think?
Oh-no, he's right.

Seven hundred dollars!
Well, you did it! Do we have fruit?
Damn, two weeks, huh? You know what, though? I really feel like I have learned something.
Really? So, are you going to stay with this 'all for her' thing?
What are you crazy? When a blind man regains his sight, does he walk around like that?

Oh.
You know that these are a delight in India.
Me too.
Although this city is my home, then.
So that's stupid what I said, do not tell him that I said that.
Umm, you invent something.
Good thanks.
It's me.
Right here.
Your eyes are very beautiful.
Thank you so much! Oh! Thank you!
He would like to kiss you.
Ok, you know what, you do not have to do it now.
No no no no!!
Not him, not you!
Well, the moment is over.
Oh.
Oy!

Hey! Wait a minute, wait a second. Do you think these pearls are beautiful?
I would really prefer a mountain bike.
As Janice's birthday approaches, I want to offer her something special. Come here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
Do you, ah, want to offer him something special, flowers, sweets, chewing gum, girls love chewing gum.
It's a good idea, 'Dear Janice, celebrate her Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to do something serious to him.
Oh, you want something serious.
You know what you should do, you should give him one of those uh, barytic enemas.
These are very serious.
Okay. Listen, I'm going here, and you never buy me anything.
No, no, you can not, you can not, okay, you can not, you can not buy her pearls, you can not, you can not, you can not.
Why not?!
Oh my God. Uh, all right, here's the thing, that's the thing, okay, the thing is ...
What is the thing?
Okay. I went to the Mattress King showroom and saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?
They were in his office.
Well, she would not do that, she's with, she's with me.
Okay!!

I tell you it's like watching Bambi learn to walk.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are going to be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Just there! Can we get some of that here please? Here we are.
Hey! Are they crab cakes? Did not I tell you to come straight to me when other crab cakes were ready?
How are you?
You are
I really wish you would not do it.
Now, all you have to do is spend a little more, okay?
Then we can put you to bed, okay?
Smile and do not talk
Speech! Speech! Let's listen to the birthday girl! Huh?
Pheebs !!
You do not see? Everyone is watching me! The plan works! I have not even had to remove my top yet!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
Hey Chandler, you can not keep your hands for a second!
Oh-ho, I think that's good.
Well, you have to do it because maybe it's stupid.
Well, it's just while Monica and I were dancing with them that it was the first time I knew you were the woman I wanted to dance with all my dances.
Oh shit!

Okay.
The super could not understand what he was doing.
An electrician at $ 200 an hour could not understand what he was doing.
I had seven pretty serious shocks.
I give up officially.
Thank God.
I guess Joey was right, it does not matter.
See? I do it. I do it totally. I lost it.

Are there no conscious men in the city for both of you?
He has nobody.
Yes, we feel a little responsible.
I can not believe you said woowoo. I do not even say Woowoo.
Oh, she's going up! She is coming up!
When we come back, we will talk about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
You may want to put the children to bed for this one.
You know, we do not have to watch that.
No question, forget about it.
Come on, it's your mother!
Exactly.
Chandler, I must tell you that I love your mother's books!
I like his books!
I can not fly without one!
I mean, it's so cool!
Yeah, well, you would not think it was cool if you're eleven and all your friends go around page 79 of "Mistress Bitch".
Come on, Chandler, I love your mother. I think she is an explosion.
Thank you.
And a good hot cider for Monica.
AWW thank you. Uh Rach?
Yeah?
Why does my cinnamon stick have an eraser?
Oh! That is why. I am sorry!

Oh. Oh! Mrs? Excuse me madam?
Yes?
You can not put your cigarette on a tree!
Yes I can, it worked very well.
No, but you should not! Never do that again.
I do not want! Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze Punk!
What?!
Yeah it's true you're so broken. Book 'em.
Who are you talking about too?
Save the red! Unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
I am
You apologize to the tree or call for a backup. Backup! Backup !!
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
OK, cancel the backup! Cancel the backup!

Hush! Get me out of here.
Oh.
Ross!
What?
Come here, look at this!
What? Is it the comet?
No! No no. Look, there is a bug stuck in the tar here.
Joey, come on I can not believe-I'll take you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of the most spectacular phenomena in nature, and all you're concerned about are bugs stuck in the tar and -and a woman!
You know, there is
Show me where?
Right here.
Joey, where's the pipe that held the door open?
I do not know! Yes I do.
Joey!
What?! Very good-Hey! Do not look at me! You are the one who wanted to go up and look for some stupid
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!

Wow! This place is amazing! Sting's feather he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passage!
Hi!
Hi!
I am Trudie
Uh-huh.
You must be Ben's mom.
Why would I be here?
Sit.
Yeah.
Oh Rachel it's great. It's awesome.

Hi .. how was the game?
Well..
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Fantastic! I have a question: how is this possible?
Alan
He was amazing.
It was like that, this Bugs Bunny drawing where Bugs plays all the positions, no, but instead of Bugs, it was the first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base -...
I mean, it's like it's like he's teaming us up.
Yes, we did show these Hasidic jewelers something about the softball ..
Can I ask you guys a question? Did you ever think that Alan was maybe .. sometimes ..
What?
..I do not know, a little too much Alan?
Well no. It's impossible. You can never be so Alan.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that we love.
Personally, I could have a gallon of Alan.

Well, I had a good time! I learned to cook, I ate good food, it's the first A I have since the seventh year,
Oh look! Act for beginners! Do you want to feel good?
What is going on!
Okay.
Okay, let's start with some basics. Can anyone tell me what is the difference between the backstage and the backstage?
Yes, it was a stupid idea.

My God!
These pants are burning!
Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
What is she trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano here!
Are you hot?
Ok, it just must be me then.
It was just the pants on the couch. Uh, hey, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
You drive me crazy with that!
Ok, I will stop.
Do not stop! Move the bowl further! Ross could do that!
Well, you are afraid! But at least you're no good at a man's game now.
You want to play?
Chandler, I can not play games, Ross will be home soon.
And I have to write five full pages if I want to stick to his schedule.
So, play for the next 30 minutes, then write until he gets home.
Okay! But uh, listen, what are you saying we're going up a notch?
I am interested.
Okay, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful, because I want to recover our security deposit.
Yes, I think we said goodbye to that when we invented the dart game.
Do you even remember the part of the wall that does not spit?
Uh yes, right here.

Hi, Rachel. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like punch to death Tiki?
What is it?
Weeeell is rum, and-
I am sure they will be here soon.
Yes, honey, they would not miss that.
Relax. You are only nine centimeters away. And the baby is at the station zero.
You really scare me.
Someone wants to help me, trying to tear my heart. Uh, that's great. Someone saw a nipple?
Okay, ten centimeters, let's go.
All right, honey, it's time to start pushing.
But they are not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can not tell the baby to wait for them.
Oh my God.

Here we go. Mona uh, I think it's time we - we had a conversation about - where things are with us.
Yes, I-I think I suggested that.
Aw, we-we are so, so, uh, well I-I-I love you and I-I like uh, you know, hanging out with you
And I mean, I'm having a lot of fun.
Okay.
I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun.
It must be, it must go somewhere, is not it?
So where is he going?
Ah!
This is the real question.
And-and the answer is that it's going somewhere, it's fun.
Now, I -I know what you think, having fun was like ten years ago, you know, but you're not rejuvenating.
No I mean-Not you, not you, you
I'm sorry, so where are we?
You know what?
I'll take you dinner tonight.
I found this place that makes the biggest sticks of mozzarella and jalepino poppers.
No?
Really?
They taste so good.

Drum roll.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Help me! Am I a brand or a John?
No, you're not big enough to be a Mark, but you could make a good Barney.
Look, I'm serious, okay? Tomorrow at 15:30, I go to the courthouse.
Are you going through this?
Hey, listen, this name has been with me all my life.
Ok, that's probably why the kids harassed me at school and I never succeed with women. So, starting at 4 am tomorrow, I'll be either Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You have problems because of you!
Not your name!
Okay, it must stop!
Chandler is a big name!
In fact, yes, I'm sorry.
I know you really wanted me to name baby Joey, but huh, so, I-I'm, I'm going, I'll call baby Chandler.
Heck! I thought it was going to be romantic like hell!
It was.

Listen, I just saw the brains of my best friends smear the canvas, it's not going to be me, not me.
Wow! It was good. It was ... tweezers?
No.
Whoa. It was really good.
Thanks, suggestions?

Hi!
Have you slept with Ursula ?!
Uh, a little bit. She she came in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
You did not notice that she was wearing different clothes ?!
I was so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! You know what? It's so weird.
No-no it is not!
I do not want to lose you!
It's like I tell Ursula that I made love to her and that I thought she was you.
So I guess that's it.
Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You feel like her.
Yeah, you too.

Hey!
Hi.
So, did shopping make you feel better with Ross?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well,
You can?
Yeah. I just need you to bring me photos of Ross.
Um-hmm.
And a little piece of chocolate.
Okay.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just coming out of a very serious relationship
I know! And I'm coming out of a marriage, I mean talking about destined to be!
Right! I just think it's happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too late. Look at it, I will not let you go this time.
I hear you. But! Unfortunately, my company transfers me abroad!
Oh no! Where to go To Paris?
No! No! Not Paris.
Too much London? No, no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
Ok, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm transferred to Yemen!
When?
I do not know exactly.
Ugh, well I'll just have to get hold of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I know it's sometime tomorrow.

Ooh, that's it! Oh it's him! It's him!
Awesome! Go and get it.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go first.
He is not really my type.
Not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what he looks like. People tell everything to doctors.
But you said he was that good guy!
But lately, all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, and then they turn out to be the biggest jerks
You attract stinkers.

Chandler.
Ms. Tedlock. You are beautiful today. And may I say, it's a
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to go to his office late in the day.
Oh, listen.
If it's about these stuffing memos, I have nothing to do with them.
Really.
Nothing at all.
Really.
Nothing.

You know, when we move in together, can I have a rubber dispenser?
Of course! Joey would not let you have one?
No. When it comes to candy, it is surprisingly strict.
Hey, did you find a way to tell him you're moving?
No, no, I keep trying, you know?
I can go out, "Joey, I have it too" but then I lose my courage and I always end up "going to the bathroom."
He may think that I am sick.
You know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I just have to finish!
You know, next time we'll see them, we'll tell them what.
Okay?
That's all.
Oh, so is it going to work now? Are you just going to order me all the time?
Rather.
Okay.
Hi Monica!
Hi!
Hey dude, do you feel better?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! You are pregnant!
Yes, if you get married in Vegas, you will only be married in Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you're getting married in Vegas, you're married everywhere.
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh my God! well

Do you see this guy? He's in the classics now, but you know, as soon as we leave, he goes straight to porn.
He will go up to the counter with
Yeah.
I missed that.
Me too.
So, you want a hamburger?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, you know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We will.
OK, Rachel, you want to put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
No Monday
Every year.

And
Hey! Ross!
Die hard
Yes. Hey, what do you say we make it a dual feature?
What did you rent?
Die Hard 2
Joey, it's
Oh, well we look a second time and his
Joey, we
And?
And it'll be cool to see him again! Yeah!
Die hard
Dude, you did not say
Yes, I just received plans.
John McClane had plans!
No, you see, I want to leave here before Joey gets angry and starts calling everyone slutty.
What are you talking about? Bitch.

I know you missed this operation on purpose.
I can not prove it yet, but when it does, you will go to jail for murder.
I do not care if you are my brother.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your article on punctuated balance in the Devonian era was top notch!
Stop browsing my stuff!
Hey!
Hey!
I just wanted you to know that I changed my mind: I'm going to do it, I'm going to kiss Joey.
No you can not! Contacts with friends are a bad idea.
Please, and you and Chandler?
It's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Hello Hello
What about all the guys whose phone numbers you have? Why do not you kiss one of them?
I could, I could but I do not want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Okay I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I will do it.
And I can not stop you.
No.
Hey Rach, did you see Charlie somewhere?
I am smarter than

Oh, hello, Gunther, look at that.
Yeah, it's Chandler who makes me laugh.
Hey Ross, listen, you want to drink something, because I'm going there.
Uh, yes, I'll have a coffee. Thanks dude.
Sure. Coffee? Because I go there.
No.
No thanks.
You need anything, because I go there.
I would like an icy water.
You got it.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just be friendly.
Joey, honey, I do not think you're supposed to go back there.
Nah, it's good. That's it, Gunther?
Do not give me a wink. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I do not see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
Joey, are you working here?
No.
Hey, waiter.
Yeah?

You joined Monica and Chandler, if you listen to this message, we'll probably be sifting through. Yes we are.
Hello, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase Museum.
I'm calling for Monica Geller.
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she is still interested in the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
It's Chandler Bing! It's Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-no! Not the groom !!

Thank you.
Thank you.
I can not believe that! It's like the worst night of my life!
You know Monica, your relationship with Chandler has had a slight setback. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am
It's crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I do not even want to see Richard again.
So go fix it!
Go find Chandler!
He is probably in your room!
Tell him that you are sorry and that you love him.
You know what? You're right Phoebe. You are right. Thank you!
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Someone lost that?
Comin 'out. Place your bet. The dice are out. Double or nothing! Pay the front line!
Hmm.

Do you remember where is the duck food?
Yes, it's in the apartment of guys under the sink. Why?
Because I'm going to London.
What?! What do you mean you go to London?
Yes, I must tell Ross that I love him.
Now, honey, take care of yourself, you do not have those babies until I get back.
I-Rachel, you can not go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves all the information so he can make an informed decision.
That's not why you go!
You go there because you hope he'll say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
Forget this British chippy. "
Ohh-Do you think he'll do it ?!
No!
Because he is in love with the British chippy!
Listen, Rachel, if you go, you'll just make fun of her head and ruin her marriage!
You know, it's too late!
You missed your chance!
I'm sorry, I know it must be really hard, it's over.
You know what? No, it's not over until someone says, "Me yes".
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, how can I really chase you. I'm wearing a litter.

So everyone is here?
I arrived a little early myself.
Let's start.
The hydrosaurids were found at two main locations.
Right here.
Right here.
Now as for hydrosaurs

Anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is that I should have taken your feelings into account before going home with you that night.
I have ah, I recently learned how it feels to be on your side, and I'm sorry.
So, you think you can forgive me?
Awesome.
Thank you.
Okay goodbye.
Hello Jennifer?
Oh hello, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer here?
Oh, she's not home, huh?
Well, actually, I need to talk to you too.

Hey!
Hi.
Are you doing OK?
Uh ... I think I just got engaged.
Oh my God! He did it?
Well ... did you know he was going to ask me?
Are you kidding?
I am like the one who convinced him.
I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
And you really think it's a good idea?
I just talk to him, do not tell me I have to do it too. The puppet master tires people.
I do not know! That does not seem right to me.
Why?! You two are so made to be together, everyone thinks so.
Really?! Even Ross?
Especially Ross!
Oh, hi Pheebs. Uh, what do you know? I will come back later.
Wow! A bit like a packed house here. I guess right ... I'll come back.
There he is, your fiancee.
I suppose.
Although he plays with himself in his sleep.
I can not say that I am surprised.

Oh, it's so unfortunate.
What?
A cute and naked guy really starts to put on weight.
Okay, I'll be back in a minute. Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry I left traces of lipstick on the phone.
You did not leave any traces of lipstick on the phone.
Oh, so it must have been you. Goodbye.
Bye! That's why I moved.
Hey, you know, when we talk about it, when are you going to tell my sister that you do not live here anymore?
I think at some levels she already knows.
Night Mon Night Julio.
Adios.
Look Julio, someone left his book here.
Oh, it's mine.
Oh yes, what are you reading?
Flowers of evil, by Beaudalire. Did you read it?
Did I read it? No, you take advantage?
I thought so, but the translation is not good.
You are a poet and you do not know it.
In fact, I am a poet.
Oh, so you know it. So, uh, what kind of things do you write?
Things that affect me. The, the shadow of a tree, a laughing child, or that lip.
Mine? Right here?
I can write an epic poem on this lip.
How would it go? Well, it did not rhyme, but I liked it.

Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
I bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
What?
We are at my stop. But would you like to have a coffee?
Are we really in Montreal ?!
Yes we are. So, coffee?
The coffee sounds good. Wait, then, do you live in Montreal?
Oh no. But it only takes two hours of ferry to get to Nova Scotia.

Ok, here is lot 22.
Oh, maybe they'll taste a bit of your grandmother's.
It has a little orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Let's give a shot.
Okay. Man, I have
Oh, what was it for? Do you like a bake sale?
No, just a Friday night.
Would she?
Would she? You have eaten my chocolate bar!

Oh my God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I want to quit, but I think I should hold on, then I wonder why such a person would stay in such degrading work just because it's related to the area of ​​interest.
Gee, I do not know Rachel. Order up !! I have a Yentel soup, a James bean and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I do not have ...
I do not mind paying my dues, you know, that's all I'm going to learn about fashion by driving Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Hi! My misery amuses me?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah ....
It's not funny, it's actually my job.
Oh, believe me, I-I-I was there. I had to sort the mannequin heads at this Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, I'm just going back to talking to my friend here.
And you can start enjoying your little hamburger again.
Ah, just another thing.
Yes?!
I am, I work at
Do you want my pickle?

Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Why?
I just want to check my horoscope, see if it's right.
Oh my God.
Phoebe
Do not look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our heart and plunge into a pit of depression.
Or? Ooh, come to mom.
He is coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
We should do something. Whistle.
We will not whistle.
Go do it.
No!
Do it!
No!
Do it, do it!
Woo woo!
I can not believe you did that!

Hi! Uh, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro.
Again?
I think the things you said about me are really unfair and I would like you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
I do not see any reason why I would do this situation.
Either eat it, or be in it.
Spoon? So what do you think?
I am torn between my integrity and my desire to avoid blows. But I must be honest, your soap is abominable.
It's a girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there is a new class coming
Welcome to the introduction to the kitchen. Before you start, can anyone tell me the difference between a Dutch sauce and a Béarnaise sauce?
I can.
Okay, keep going.
Well, uh, they both have an egg yolk and a butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, lawns and especially tarragon.
That's fine, what's your name?
Monica
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Okay.

And there is a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I have never seen.
But I'm told that for fifty pesos, you can buy a human spleen.
Humaaan spleeeeen.
Olè!
What are you doing here!
Well, you said you had customers lined up on the street, so I'm here to entertain!
Awesome!
Yeah!
It's really great too, you know, some of these people already had to see me play because they asked for a bunch of my songs!
Yeah, "you're bad" and "shut up and go home".
Listen Phoebe ...
Yeah.
You know how much I like listening to your music, you know, but ...
But what?
It's a bit of a chic place.
Ok, do not say more.

I'm totally bored! Stupid rain, we ... we can not do anything.
Well, I brought some books. We could read.
Hey, he has not got to that yet.
Hey hey! I do not mind if I do it!
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmacy convention
Hey Rach, do you want to go to a convention?
We can not We are not pharmacists!
I know we are not, but Frank Medeio and ... Eva Trorro ... womba ...
Kate Miller?
Kate Miller is.
And ... it's the most sex I'm having this weekend.
In this case, should I make sure it's really good?
Thank you.

Oh my God!
We heard about your pants, I'm sorry.
This year was supposed to be great!
But it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that do not even suit me!
No, you are not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You are a cowboy!
Oh, because of the leather pants.
See? Ben do not think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now it's something.
Yeah!
It's really something. it's really cool.
Howdy partner!
Maybe I should have another pair!
Ooh, you know, they had them with fringes on all sides.
I'll go and kiss Ben goodnight.
I can not believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.
Ok, now that everything is over, I think I'll do my laundry.
Oh yes, me too. You know if this shirt is dirty. Yes.
No you did not do it You said you would, but you never did it!
Oh yes!

Great nap.
It was really.
Uh me? Gay? No! No, but I have several close friends who are.
So let's talk about women. I'm sure our readers will be interested in knowing your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, as I do, I look at a woman from top to bottom and say, "Hey, how are you?"
Oh please!
Hey, how are you?

Hey Mikey
Hey p
What are you doing?
Setting up rat traps.
To kill Bob ??
No, no, to test his neck strength.
No, Mike, I do not want to kill him!
I thought we were just going to capture him and, and you know, free him in the countryside where he might meet a friend and a crazy owl.
Ok, ok, I'm going to throw the traps.
I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
Bob?
Bob!
Robert!
Oh, wait, I think I heard it.
Oh - Oh my god!
Bob had babies!
Bob is a mom!
Better to think of a new name for him.
I do not know, I like Bob for a girl.
I do not know, I mean I'm not sure ...
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Maybe it was not Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Suzie?

Hmmm, the soup!
Joey, Ross is going to be in a second, do you want to watch Ben for me while I'm using the ladies' room?
Oh yes, no problem.
Thank you.
Hi Ben! So you want to be an actor, huh? I have to tell you it's not a picnic. There are tons of rejection.
Joey!
Which? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yes, but he waited until the last minute!
So, if I said yes, he would know that I have nothing better to do than to wait for an invitation to his stupid feast.
I said no!"
Who puts
Awesome. So the ball is in his camp?
Ball? There is no ball.

Oh, hello Rachel! I thought we said seven?
Yeah, uh, you know what, let's go.
What?! Why?!
Umm, you and your sister seem to have had a very special connection, and
Oh great! This
Okay. I do not know, listen, I do not know what's going on here but
Do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them?
No, no, they are not very nice people.
Ok, listen, I really love you a lot.
Okay?
I think it can go somewhere.
So, if I'm close to my family, are you going to let that bother us?
Well, I-I do not know. See when-when you say it that way you know it's sort of
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
What?
Yeah, okay, see you later.

It's finish.
Oh, it was awful?
Well, it was long.
I did not even realize what time it was late, until I noticed the five-hour shadow on his head.
In any case, she did not want to stay.
I called a taxi; she just left.
I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
It's just some things I thought about.
Some things about us, and even before we can think of getting together, I need to know what you think about that.
Okay. Wow, it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better crack for this baby.
Well, I'll wait for you, come when you're done.
Ok, I'll be in, 18 pages. Front and rear. Very exciting.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said we except the
Okay, I'll retract.
But I maintain my criticism, I know the food and it's not that.
Your marinara sauce tastes like tomato juice!
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I'm proud of this sauce, it's delicious.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think it's good ?! Where do you come from?
Lebanon.
Give me these tomatoes, I'll show you what it looks like! Come on, pass them to them.
How long will it take? Because I have another critic to scream.

Ok, so what happened?
Ohh Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You will have your turn!
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Nothing! It is not finished!
No! No! No!
What?!
I spent all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now everything is covered in. Actually, thank you!
Okay! Everyone ready to go to the movies?
Uh, actually, I think I'm going to skip it.
Really?
Yes, I will stay and read my book. I just want to be alone right now.
Oh. Are you sure you do not want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they receive mail and stuff.
It's ok, Joe.
Okay, let's go Pheebs.
Oh my God!

It was great.
I know.
Hey, do you realize that we have just changed our lives forever?
We may have just started a family.
In nine months we can be here and have our own baby.
And if not, we must do it on a bucket.

Ross! You must stop! Okay?! You can not just look through the peephole for three hours! You will have an eye!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I always knew she liked him!
You know, she would say no, but here we are!
Right?
We just broke up, first thing she does!
You have not just broken up.
Hey, it's been three weeks!
You slept with someone three hours after thinking about breaking up. I mean the bullets have left the weapons more slowly!
It's Bill Clinton.
Who is he huggin?
Oh my God! It's Pete! But why Bill huggin 'Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses this program!
We use it !!
Here!!
Oh my God, Monica is going out with a millionaire.
I will not go out with him.
Oh my God, I can not believe it's a real $ 20,000 check, oh that's so exciting.
Or incredibly offensive.
Oh yes, of course, that too.
What?

Hey, so, uh, do you know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yes!
You know how I'm trying to solve the problem with Emily.
Well, there is one thing Ok, that's it.
I promised that - Oh hey!
What?
Your nose is bleeding!
Oh my God.
No!
Oh not yet!
This happened when my grandfather passed away.
It's yuck!
Sorry.
Oh, all right, so I'm sorry, what did you want to say, what did you want to tell me?
Umm
Sorry. Sorry.
Ok, I can not see you anymore.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can not see you either.

Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hello, chip.
Hey, Rachel! It's okay'?
I'm awesome! I'm awesome. I have a great job at
So ah, is Monica ready?
She will be out in a second. So, Chip, how are you, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Wow! I have not seen her since ... So, Monica, are you ready?

That's right, I love you! And-and I'll play with you all the time.
How can you let him talk to your crotch like this?
He talks to the baby.
Ohh!
Okay!
Ok, because when-when he said, "I can not wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's something."
Okay. Well, I have to go guys. I will see you later.
Okay.
Oh my, oh my God!
Aw, it's amazing!
Wow!
She gives so many kicks!
Oh, she's like uh oh who's that kind of annoying soccer player?
Mia Hamm?
Mia Hamm!
Oh, it's amazing.
Oh oh !! A hand on the Joe sheet!
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!

Okay, what do you think?
Guy!
I have never known love like that.
Do you really like that?
Guy! How did you write that?
I stole Monica and changed the name.
You can not
If he goes first he can!

Hey!
Yeah!
Anyway, I - I still think we should try to fix things, see?
Like, uh, maybe we could buy tickets for another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow it's a good idea! And
Here you are.
Oh.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
Here you are.
You know I have to tell you, sometimes I think I do not understand Chandler.
You know, me and he do things all the time without you and you do not get angry.
All the time?
All the time!

Cassie, how are you doing on this hot dog.
I am all done.
Thank God.
I guess the last time we really dragged out was when our parents rented this beach house together.
Oh yes.
Right.
Do you remember the time I pinned and tickled you until you cried?
We are probably too old to do it now.
I will always remember this summer because it was when I had all those freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember this summer because that's when I realized we were connected.
It took you so long to understand it, huh?
Well, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.

Relax each muscle of your body.
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
Ok, now close your eyes and think of a happy place.
Okay, tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Okay. No, no, no, not something Richard, just put the glass. And go out!
I'm sorry, but it's my happy place.
Okay, use my happy place.
Ok, I'm just right, I have to ask that you do not move anything.
Okay, I'll try not to do it.
Okay, all right, you're in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky ...
Do you think that breaking with him was a huge mistake?
Okay, there are no questions in this happy place. Okay, just the warm breeze and the moonlight running through the trees ....
I bet he's totally on me, I bet he's fine.
Very good, bets and bets of all kinds are not allowed, I am sure, in this happy place.
Okay.
Just, you know, the beautiful waterfalls and the flowing fountains.
And the soothing sound of the bubbling brook ...
Ok, it does not work. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.

OK sweetheart, see you later.
See you later, Rach.
Goodbye Julie.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, come on, cut it off.
Hey?
What?
Can I ask you something?
Hey Rach, do you want to hear the new song that I'm thinking of singing this afternoon? I wrote this morning in the shower.
Okay.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see you for a minute?
What's up?
F.Y.I ..
I decided to pay a professional musician to play on Sunday afternoon.
Her name is Stephanie ... something.
She is supposed to be very good.
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is mean, but so much it makes me want to put my finger in my eye in my brain and make it turn.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, you can not do that to him.
Uh ...
Oh no no no no Oh no no no no I have to do this to him?

Ahh no
Oh.
Are you jealous?
No, I know I do not see why she has to play with you, that's all.
I mean, does not she have any other friends of the strippers mother?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous.
Okay, it's about people feeling some things about strippers.
And you know, and um, I ...
Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait wait.
What?
Huh.
Well, there's a kiss he will not forget for a few hours, you know.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turn it on and send it to a stripper.

I can not believe you came back.
Do not say anything.
I do not want to talk, I do not want to think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me here and now.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
You missed the exit!
Oh sorry.
My God, what were you thinking?
Uh, Barry.
Awwww !!

I just thought I thought you were doing it, I did not know you were in love!
Guy!
And hat to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And could I say that your breasts are still visible?
God!
Okay! So that's it! It's finish! Everyone knows!
In fact, Ross does not know it.
Yes, and we would appreciate it if nobody told him yet.

Dear Mary-Angela.
Hi.
How are you.
This is the most difficult letter I have ever had to write.
What's wrong with you?
How do you think Joey will react when he finds out that you ripped off his sister with a letter?
Well, this is the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When will I actually be in Cuba?
Okay, listen, listen, you have to do it yourself, okay in person.
At least you know his name.
You're just going home and you're asking Mary-Angela, okay, when she comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you drop her gently.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and asks Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?

Hey.
You may have been right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Uh, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
Okay.
Ok, that's it. I have two queens, what do you have?
One two and five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Oh yes! Ok, let's play again. What do you have?
A four and a nine.
You're kidding, are not you?
No why?
Well, it's a full cup!
Heck! I am good in Cup!

What? Why? Where are you?
I'm always on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! I am sorry! The guy is drunk, they will not let me go before we have this.
Oh my God! I will have to find another minister.
No! No, I am the minister! Well, look, put both on the phone, I'll marry them right away.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Do not hang up! I'm going to marry you and me now! I have the power!

Oh hi Joey! What's up?
I can not decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you traveled a lot, did not you?
Yes, I have been around.
Ok, no matter which road should I take the North Road or the South Road?
Ooh, if you take the road north, there is a man in Illinois with a bee stubble.
Okay, I have to protest, I've lived all my life in Illinois and I do not know any man with a bee stubble!
Wisconsin, on the other hand, could be a different story.
Awesome! Problem solved!
Estelle, you must find me work. I lost my health insurance.
Okay, the first thing to do is to limit the damage.
Why?
Well, I think someone may have criticized you badly in town.
Asshole!

You mean every time Monica and Chandler do the laundry or do their shopping or -Oh!
Monica spent all this time on the phone with sad Linda from the camp!
Uh-huh, do it. I do it. Phone do it.
Oh!
Oh, I can not believe it!
I mean, I think it's great!
For him.
She could perhaps do better.
Hi guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
Phoebe has just discovered Monica and Chandler.
You mean how are they friends and nothing more?
No Joey, she
Ok, so now they know you know and they do not know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but you know what?
It does not matter who knows what.
Now enough of us know that we can tell them we know!
Then all lies and secrets would finally be over!
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided he was gay, moved out and abandoned his entire family.

You know you're a friend getting married, you have to change things.
Do you really think it would be so different?
How could it be otherwise?
I mean very soon, they are going to have children and then they will just go out with other couples who have children.
And then maybe they'll have to leave the city to be near a
Well, things are changing.
I do not want them to move into a
It's okay Joe.
It's always there!
Ms. Braverman must be outside.
She could be out of town. Maybe she will be gone for months.
By then, the cheese cake may have gone bad. We do not want her to come back to the wrong cheesecake.
No, it could kill her.
Well, we do not want that.
No, so we protect it.
But we should take it.
But we should act quickly.
Why?
Because I think I just heard him moving there.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Hey, Kicky. What are you doing?
I'm just trying to make myself comfortable. I can not sleep in my underwear.
Well, you go.
I was thinking. You know, I always see girls above girls ...
Are they end to end or big like pancakes?
You know what I mean, about how I always go out with all these women.
And I always thought that when the good come, I'll be able to stand up and go far, you know?
Now, I look at my dad, thinking ...
Hey, you are not him.
You are you
When they were all on you to go into your father's pipe business, did you give in?
No.
No.
You have decided to embark on the job of unemployed actor.
Now it was not easy, but you did it!
And I'd like to believe that when the good woman comes along, you'll have the courage and the courage to say, "No thanks, I'm married."
Do you really think that?
Yeah. I really do.
Thank you, Chandler.
Get off!

Hi.
Your Alfredo Fettuccini looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a snack before cooking?
And the cream?
The cheese makes me thirsty.
Okay. Let's move on.
Okay.
Oh! Something smells good at Monica! Oh my God! It's absolutely amazing! Have you never done this before?
Oh no!
I do not know anything about cooking.
I had to ask someone what's the name when when the water makes these little bubbles.
Well, hat to the chef.
I-I'm sorry, your mouth was full, I did not hear what you said Umm, hat to whom now?
Leader!
It is true.

Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.
How is it going?
Well. Oh oh! Roger has a dinner and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
Nothing, it's just, uh ... it's Roger.
I do not know, there's just something about ...
Basically, we think it's ...
We hate this guy.
Yeah. The hate.
We're sorry, Pheebs, sorry.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay, you may not think so, though, it's just that he's so insightful that it scares you
... No, we hate him.
We are sorry.

Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
I return all those things that Chandler bought for guilt.
Yes it was mine.
Because I thought you had a girl and she left it there.
Yes, it would have made more sense.
You know, I do not even feel like I know you dude anymore!
Look, I'm just going to ask you this once.
And whatever you say, I will believe you.
Were you or were you not on a gay cruise?
!

Oh hey! There are children playing in the street, you want to go give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a bullet, maybe you can stick some razor blades in and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
What did she say?
She said, "If I'm not happy to get married somewhere that we find in a day, well, we should just postpone it."
The reporter?
Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent for this wedding?
Does the tiny brain of my sister, my sister, understand that people have taken thousands of miles to get here, huh?
It's not good.
I realize that people will be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
I can not ask people to do that? Do you want to ask people to do it?
Do not point your pants on me!
We have no choice!
Wherever half decent would have been reserved months ago, Ross, do not you understand?
It's our marriage that I'm talking about.
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. It's when we get married.
So, what are you saying? It's now or never?
No, I say it's now.
Or?
There is no 'or' in the mind. What's the problem with these pants? !!
It's not the pants.
It's you who is upside down.
And if, and if you do not understand how important it is to me, well, then maybe we should not get married at all!
No wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please.

Hello Darling.
See you later.
What? I bought food, I was going to prepare you for dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait until I ask you!
Hello, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase Museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she is still interested in the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
Oh please, he did not hear it! He did not hear that !!
It's Chandler Bing! It's Chandler Bing!
NOOOO !!!!!!!!

My! What are you doing here?
I came to give you this and that.
Oww! Big ring!
Yes all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Are you talking about me?
Yes all the time.
Really?
But uh, we just call you Bobo the type of sperm.

Would you like to watch this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much shit?
In fact, I think this apartment defiles the good name of shit
Look at this. Can I have this?
What?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, jumped, jumped, jumped.
Suddenly, Leon, the manager, calls me in his office.
It turns out that they fired the lunch leader and guess who got the job.
If it's not you, it's a horrible story.
Fortunately it's me.
And, they made me the head of shopping, thank you very much.
Anyway, I just found Ross and Chandler downstairs and they think we should go party.
You know, a nice place.
Yes, a nice place.
Yeah!
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?

So what do you think?
I think it's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
So, how does it work, you will balance the plates on the heads of these little guys?
We do not care, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Heads up Ross! Goal! You are afraid!

What is this?
Thank you. Put you at ease.
I got you.
This place is really my grandmother.
I got it when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
So, if the owner asks, I am an 87 year old woman who is afraid of her VCR.
So are you thirsty?
Oh, you say I am!
Ok, here is your penis!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
How was your first day?
Oh okay.
Oh God, what a nice surprise! It's such a beautiful house.
Thank you, it's my mother. So it's cooking.

Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Awesome! How about going to the Italians in Bleaker Street, right?
Ooh, I love this place! So no.
What about mom Lisettie?
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long has this milk come out?
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
It's milk is mine.
I bought it today because I was thirsty for milk, you know.
Okay let's go!
Hey buddy! Do you know Article 11-B of the French Health Code which requires that all waste be refused?
But then I should go around the dry cleaner.
Oh, so you say you would prefer convenience to health ?!
Ok, stop!
Larry, all right, you can not just be Larry and not Larry, the health inspector?
You know I mean it was really exciting at first, but now it's like, okay, so where are we going to eat?
Well, I guess I could give him a warning.
Thank you.
Ok, come on!
Go!
Go!
Now, if after dinner you still really need to break someone, I know a hot dog salesman who takes his nose.

No! No! Phoebe, come on! I do not want to change! Please come! I can throw wet towels here!
No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. I am sorry.
Everything is fine! It seems so much fun.
Yeah.
God, what a waste.

Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost.
A little girl lent her uniform to her nineteen-year-old sister, who went to the United States.
Nimitz and sold more than 2,000 boxes.
Hey! How was the interview?
Oh, I ruined everything. I would not even have hired me.
Oh, come here my darling, listen, you'll continue as a thousand interviews before finding a job.
That's not how it should happen.
It's the worst Christmas of my life.
You know what Rachel, you should maybe tell you, stay here at the cafe.
I can not!
It's too late!
Terry has already hired this girl there.
Look at her, she even has a waitressing experience.
Last night, she taught everyone how to make a napkin ... swans.
This word was swans.

What do we have here?
A piece of something: underpants, greeting cards and what looks like a half-carbonized image-Wow, this guy is hairier than the chef!
You know, it's a really funny story how it went.
Its good.
Its good.
You do not have to explain.
This is not the first bonfire of a boyfriend that we have seen become uncontrollable.
You are our third call tonight.
Really?
Oh, of course, Valentine's Day is our busiest night of the year.

I'm so sorry, guys. I did not want to kill you.
No, you were right. I do not have a plan.
Thank God. Food.
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I do not even have a "pl".
No, no, that's not what we ordered ... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Expect! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Wait, was he a small, curious looking guy from the Mediterranean?
Was he wearing a gorgeous blue suit?
And-and a link of strength?
Oh my God.
Are you crazy?! We have the pizza of George Stephanopoulos!
Uh, Pheebs? Who is George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
I see a pizza!
Oh, I want to see! Let me see! Let me see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?

Hey, do you know what a good rainy day is?
What?!
I mean the naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
No no!
What are you crazy ?!
Come on! When you leave, you have to play, it's like a law!
All is done!
AWW thank you.
Ok, who's next ?!
No-o-o! No way!
Come please?! I am boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend ... No!

It's beautiful! It's as if the first floor of the bathroom had ever existed. Whoa! Are you going there for?
What, like a number?
Hey!
Hi! Goodbye!
Ok, I have finished my choices, these are final.
Well, it's time.
Ooh, very official.
Oh, yes, you know that Chandler printed it on his computer.
And who laminated it?
It would be me.
Okay, let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer and Dorothy Hammel?
Hey, this is my list.
All right darling, you realize she's only running like that on the ice.

Ok, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the
Hi! And what class do you go to?
Umm, I'm actually a freshman, but I understand a lot, you see, I-I'm graduating early
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should have said that I would need an adult doctor.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified for
Hush!
Doogie, hush!
Does anyone not understand that I will soon have babies?
Huh?
Go!
Go boy, go!
Oh cool! You made her cry!

Hey, there are people outside asking questions about sweets.
Well, they'll have to wait, will not they? I only have two hands !!
Need help?
No! You do not know the system! Nobody will play with the system!
Your license please.
You do not want to hear about my dream, Agent Pretty?
It is little. I will be back with your ticket.
You have a son!
I know. I know.

Uh, like, could these margaritas
Good morning, Mr. Bing.
I loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Thank you. Listen to the weekly numbers, I'm going to need it on my desk
Sure.
No problem.
You have to give them something, you know.
Ok, now it was Gerston, Santos, and who is the guy with the mustache?
Petrie.
Petrie, okay, okay. Okay, some people are going to work

....right?
Right?
I mean it's pretty amazing you know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.
You know I do not need it, I do not need it, huh, I have you now as friends, Susan and you.
Ah, Susan will be delighted.
717? Where is 717? Hey, you have more for Susan, right?
No, but I'm fine, I'm just going to get pickles or something.
Ross, thank you god.
Pheebs? Why are you whispering?
I ate an insect.
Hi Rachel, tampons only represent a penny. Let's do the stock.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas and we do not know where we are, so we can not get a tow truck.
Oh, now you want a favor?
Yes please.
Well, I'm sorry, your car broke down, but I'm a little too busy with some of my true friends, but call me to let me know that you're safely home, okay?
Phoebe, wait a second. Here, take my car, go get your friends.
No, I will not look for them.
Listen, we both know you're going to do it because you're not a fool.
Okay?
So you can either sulk here for half an hour then go get them, or save time and sulk in the car.
No, Rachel does not want me ...
Listen, I-I'm-I'm sorry that Rachel dumped you because she fell in love with that guy Mark, and you're the innocent victim in all of this, but do not punish your friends for what Rachel did you made.
Yes you are right.

God, I feel so guilty towards Ross.
Oh, I know.
I feel like it's my fault.
Type of? If you kept that for yourself, none of that would have happened.
Well, I keep so many things for myself these days, something was sure to escape!
Well, I think what you said is very courageous.
Okay, I can not sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? What about the animal rights issue?
Well, I read and for your information, the mink are not very nice.
Ok, I admit it!
I love this coat!
Ok, that's the best thing I've ever had around me, including Phil Huntley!
Do you remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine!

So, your father is gone. He is a nice man!
Oh no
I better leave. (She will sit in the
Ross, I'm so sorry. Okay. I promise to solve the problem with him tomorrow in person or by email
I do not care about your father! I care about Mona! She was there and now she is completely panicked!
Oh, I'll fix that. What is his e-mail address?
Rachel!
Okay, I promise you. I will fix it. I swear. I'm going, I'm going, I'll talk to him.
Okay!
Okay.
Thank you!
That's all?!
You call that a fight?
Come on!
"We were at the break!"
"No we were not!"
What happened to you both?
!

Hello, could we have two burritos, please?
I am sorry.
But not sorry, because you do not have to live with it.
We have a reservation under the name of Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Fourty-five minutes? We have tickets for the
I am sorry. Christmas is a busy time, sir.
Is it because of the burrito?
You must give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to have a table! Places like this are always discouraged. Everyone wants to get paid.
Well, calm down, O'Mally. I'm going to drag him some money.
You must be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.
Listen, we're a little in a hurry, so if you could get us a picture a little faster, I'd appreciate it.
Of course sir.
Okay.
I'd better go back to my office.
Okay, you work hard! I will remember to put that in your assessment.
My what?
Well, it's been two months since you've been here and your boss is required to submit an assessment of his performance.
But you know, there is one thing I have not evaluated yet.
Are you serious?
No, I always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean that?

I can dry it.
I can put gel on it.
No matter, I always end up with that little cowlicky thing in the middle of my head.
It's so boring.
Does it bother you?
You're making me angry.
Is there a chance you have not seen that?

Hey Joey, what are you doing?
Sweep. Why? Turn you on?
No.
Huh. What if I swept a chimney?
Joey, did
Where are you going? The vicar will not be home for hours.
Joey, where did you hear that word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Did you find my book ?!
Yes I did!
Joey, what are you doing in my room ?!
Ok, listen, I'm sorry, I went for a nap and I know I should not, but you have porn!
Hey hey, what do you know?
I do not care!
I am not ashamed of my book.
There is nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little eroticism.
It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which you will never understand.
You have porn!

Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want shortbread? Hey, it's Scottish like you.
Oh no thanks. I do not like
What?!
Well it's just that my whole family was chased out of Scotland by the Vikings. Anyway, a lot of bad memories.
Well, it seems to me that your family is ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.
No!
No-no they are not.
They are always very angry!
But you know that Chandler is also half Swedish.
Do you know what the Swedish people are famous for?
Sit down and be quiet.
Well yeah yeah the Scottish story is so much more
You can not play the bagpipes at the wedding!
How did you know about this ?!

Hi!
Hi!
Come in.
Thank you for coming, uh, all right, there were a lot of people interested in the play, but I reduced it and
Awesome!
Well, now, before making my final decision, I just want to make sure our personalities match.
Okay, so I did a little test.
Now, I'm going to say a word, and then you say the first thing that comes to your mind.
I can do it.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Fight.
Very well! Okay. G.
Chain?
Excellent! Ok, uh, dog.
Kitten?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but bye!

Dad, please, do not bite here!
Okay, and if you want to get up, why do not you sit on the-
Monica, leave him alone
Do you want to hurry?
You did not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers ?!
And that they will drink a lot!
?
No, but do it again because it's so romantic.
Well, you are so slow! Can not you do it faster?
Joey!
Come on!
I do not want to make mistakes, okay?
This is the only dessert and if I shit everyone is going to be like 'Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel fucking the trifle?
So why do not you let me worry about trifling and eating, okay?
Oh, I am!
Ross, if you do not tell them, then I'll do it!
Ok, alright!
Ross! May I speak to you for a second?
Oh, can that wait a second Joey? I have to say something to my parents. No it can not? Okay.

You're too cute! How did you come to be so cute?
Well, my grandfather was Swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny bunny.
Ok, now you are even more cute !!
You know it's a popular opinion today, I must say.
What?
The strangest thing happened at the café, I think, I think Phoebe was dragging me.
What are you talking about?
I tell you that I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
It is not possible!
Ow!
I'm sorry, Phoebe always thought you were charming, asexually.
Oh, you know, I do not hear enough.
I'm sorry, I think you just understand it.
No, I did not misunderstand, okay? She was all about me! She touched my biceps to shout loudly!
This biceps?
Well, it's not bent for now!

It's Phoebe.
Uh, well I have some bad news, can I enter?
Uh, well, grandma is dead.
No, she just died today! Ok, we have a memorial service tomorrow.
No you did not do it!
And many people! Look, are you coming to the memorial service or not?
Well. Ok, enjoy your concert.

Anyway, his name is Allan and we have been going out for three years.
He was my first client when I became a party organizer.
He was preparing a party for his girlfriend at the time.
Never mind.
And he was Theta Beta Pi in Syracuse.
Oh. Oh that's great!
Oh, you're one of
Really? Like what?
Well, you know, we would repeat everything the other said, or we would jump out of the closet to scare ourselves, or change the sugar to salt so they put salt on their cereal.
It's a good one.
Yeah? Do you like that one?
Yes, you are funny.
I am funny?
Oh thank you, God!
Well, I have a ton!
Uh, oh here-you want a good one?
Here is a good one.
Uh, you take a quarter, a quarter and you blacken the edge.
Right?
And then you tell no one, I bet you can not roll that area from your forehead to your chin without leaving your face.
And when they do, they have a big black pencil line in the center of their faces.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I'm-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?

Chloe? Hi..
Is it me who take your watch?
Did you take my watch?
I'm sorry, I'm doing this.
You keep it, listen, did you tell someone about us?
Oh no. I think it's not really anyone's business, you know.
Oh, another thing. Hoshi thinks my presence in the ring could affect my concentration.
Yeah. That was the problem.

Excuse me, Doug? Hey there, sports fan !!
Bing! Do you have these numbers for me?
So are you still in contact with someone from high school?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and uh, I think that's it. And you?
Oh yes, I always stay with Simmons and Zana, you know.
I see Spindler a lot.
Devane, Kelly and I meet Goldie from time to time.
Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Is that all?
Hey, after high school, you just lose touch. Oh yes! I met Richard Dorfman.
Ohh, how is he?
Not so well, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Is not he an architect now?
Yes, they still wear underwear.

So the guy from Porsche got his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I loved how it feels when everyone thinks I own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you wear the clothes?
Really?!
Oh yes! Yeah, so you ran into Richard! You took a bite! It's not a big deal.
Awesome!
Okay, london 1

Hey, my, I was just doing the dishes!
Hey!
Oh! It's you. Hi.
And me?! You just said that I could!
I will not even get married! Ok, that's a question for science fiction writers!
I can not believe you do not choose me.
Hey, how can he
I'm not even I'm not even
Well, you know what, that's all. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Yes! Shame on you guy.

Eh eh! Stanley! Eh eh! You lead the man is here! Let's get to work.
Umm, slight change of plan. We closed.
Wh-what ?! Why?!
It's a matter of money, we do not have one.
You're kidding, are not you?
No.
What?!
It's probably just temporary. We hope to have more money soon, so if you could just relax.
Uh, go out ?! How long?
I do not know.
One week?
Maybe two?
The money will arrive!
People will always want to invest in movies!
Hey, you're not rich, are you?
No!
Hey, it's worth it. Look at Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Hey buddy, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yeah.
These are gone for you.
Thank you. Congratulations on your big break.

Rachel, do you still have muffins?
Yes, I forget which ones.
Oh, you're busy, I'm fine, I'll get it. Someone else wants one?
Hey.
Hey!
So, how was Joan?
I broke with her.
Do not tell me because of the big nostril?
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew away.
Come on, they were not so huge.
I tell you, she leaned back; I could see his brain.
How many perfectly good women will you reject for the most superficial insignificant things?
Hold it, hold it.
I have to join Chandler for this one.
When I came to town for the first time, I went out several times with this girl, very hot, who kisses well, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
It drove me crazy.
You or me?
J? I understood. Um, Joey, women do not have Adam's apples.
You do not care about me, do you?
Yeah.
It was a good one. For a second, I thought "whoa".

Oh my God, he lost it. He totally lost it.
What?
Or! Or we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them at the source.
You are a genius!
Aww, man, now we will not be friends of the bank anymore!
Now, there are two reasons.
Hey.
Hey!
Oh, do you remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Or?!
On the touchy.
And
No, I know!
I'm sorry, but as soon as I touch it, I just want to throw my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, the next time you massage, you should try to distract yourself.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like when I'm doing something exciting and I do not want to have
Thank you Joey.
No-no, thank you

Hey Estelle, listen
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They
What are you talking about? I never left you! You have always been my agent!
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh well, no harm, no fault.
Ok, are you free tonight?
Yeah!!
Tonight? You did not say it would be night.

Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Yes, we were just looking around.
Oh, oh, you are, you are university colleagues.
What exactly were you looking for, hmm?
Perhaps, perhaps, Dr. Chester Stock's reflections on the Smiledon Californicus?
uh
Ah Ah get out of here! Uh, meet someone? Or-or are you just here to revisit Marion's perspective on evolution?
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far too progressive.
I find Marion's views far too progressive.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm a teacher here, Ross Geller.
Ross Geller, why do I know this name? It's uh-Wait! Have you written this?
Yes! Are you the person who checked my book ?!
You see, you do not look like I thought. You are so young.
Well, I skipped the note.

You did not have the right to tell me that you already had feelings for me.
What?
I was doing well with Julie before discovering your identity.
Hey, I was doing well before I knew about you. Do you think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
The fact is that I ...
I do not need that now, okay.
It's too late, I'm with someone else, I'm happy.
This ship sailed.
Okay, okay, go ahead and do it, okay Ross.
Well.
Because I do not need your stupid ship.
Well.
Well.

Oh, it's so romantic to send people on honeymoon.
You know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel have a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Just now my love.
See you later.
Oh shoot!
I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later.
I do not have a key, they took mine to give it to you.
What?! They took mine to give you!
Why would they take our keys?
Wow! It seems like we have a lot of good things.
Oh yes, but my mother gave us the most beautiful gifts.
A
No, she's going to live with us for eight weeks.
Uh what?
Yes! She will help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
What are you not serious about?
I mean, she's a very nice woman, but there's no way to take her eight weeks.
She will make us totally crazy.
Hi Ross!
Hi roommate!

Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I do not know!
It's not like it's porn!
It is a serious and legitimate film.
You know?
And nudity is really important for history.
That's what you say about porn.
You are right. Maybe I should not even answer the call.
No! No you should! Many major actors make nude scenes! I mean, the chance to play in a movie? Come on!
Well, that's right.
And I'm naked only in a scene.
In addition, it sounds really good.
My character is Catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
Who flee together and get caught in this big storm of rain.
So we go in this barn, we undress and we stand.
It's really nice and tender.

Hey whats up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But are you still moving in together, right? Because my ad has been released today.
"Wanted, roommate, non-smoker, not ugly." Pleasant!
Yeah?
I just thought, after living with you, it would be a nice change of pace to have a roommate, you know?
I can learn from someone, someone different from me.
And what's more different than me; a guy who is

So where are we going next?
This witness will not return my calls, so we'll see if we can surprise him on his way home.
Surprise him? We are not, we will not make anyone crazy, are we?
Go dude! Listen, then, are you going to squeeze the Perps shoes a bit before he gets up?
It's a witness, not a perp. And nobody speaks like that!
Yes, nobody speaks like that!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey, I'm more of a cop than you two!
How do you count that?
Hi! I'm up front, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
I suppose.
Here you are. Thank you!
Wait, Rachel! Where is the other?
Oh what, do you want both?
Rachel Karen Green, where is the other earring ?!
Okay, okay, listen, do not panic, but I lost it a bit.
I know it's in the apartment, but I
What am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell him to wear his own earrings.
These
Nooo! Nooooo! Did you lend me Monica's earrings ?! I do not have the right to borrow his stuff!
Why not?
Because I'm losing business!

Well, you sweat.
These are pearls of joy.
Oh that's nice. Do not touch me.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Yeah!
What is going on?
Chandler is still gone!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide-and-seek with someone you know to be at risk of stealing ?!

Okay. Are you ready to push again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Ok, ok, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Yeah!!
Little Leslie is here!
We have another one!
Oh my God, I can not believe I have two or two children.
How is this scary?
Come on, little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
Okay, he's coming. He is coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler is a girl!
Oh my God, kindergarten flashback.
They must read the sonogram badly.
Because they thought it was a boy, but Chandler is a girl!
Chandler is a girl!
Ok, keep telling it!
Am I too late ?!
No-no ah, everything is fine. Everyone is healthy, there are 30 fingers and 30 toes.
We have our babies?
Yeah.
Oh, we have our babies.

Hi Toby!
Hi Bobby.
It's Bob actually. Hey, you work here, can you tell me where this Chandler
Uhh yeah. Yeah, that's right, just downstairs. Right there, yes. May I ask you why?
I want to talk to this bastard, see what is his problem.
Ok, Bob, listen, I'm the reason you did not get the job here.
Toby no.
Bob!
Toby! I will not let you cover it. Everything you say now will make me even more angry with Chandler!
Ohh!
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this cradle! This is so cute!
I know! I found it on the street.
Are you serious-really ?! It's in such good shape.
Yeah.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
I do not know.
It moves.
Ew.
It's always - he has a tail! Get out of here! Get out of here !!
Ooh! Ah! Okay!

Well, I went to Kyle's last night to take some things and we had to remember
we chatted almost all night and realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there were still feelings. So
Oh, just tell him Kyle!
We will do another try.
What about her groans and constant need for attention ?!
I will work there.
Oh yes, because you are so capable of change.
You know, he buzzes when he pee!
I know.
It makes him miss the bowl, but it does not matter.
We are really sorry.
It does not matter, we do not need you. In fact, hey, I'm already above.
Yes, and you know what? I do not give the ass of a tiny rat.
Yes, we will go there.
I am sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were right, you were right for her. You know, she
Oh. You know, he's buzzing while he's doing other things.
Yes, we are better without them.
And you know, even if they separate, you better not leave it in your sad club!
Club of divorced men.
Potato, Potaato.

Why did not this valet come back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you have the keys?
Porsche.
It's totally your fault!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you tore the paper from the court reporter's machine !!
Can we, can we just forget that this has already happened?
Yes of course, absolutely! You are right. I am sorry.
Thank you.
Yes.
Okay, I guess I'll go packing.
Okay. Oh, wait! One more thing, do we still have to settle the question of "us?"

Phoebe!
Yeah?
Did you see Chandler ?!
No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said there was a cancellation and we could ride our wedding and Chandler heard!
I know!
How is it serious?
!
Well for the average guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh my God!
I know! I know! And he totally panicked and I can not find him anywhere!
What are you going to do?
Well, I'll never listen to you again, that's for sure!
"You know, can evil do if you put your name?
Rachel said that!
Well, Rachel is not here!

Come on.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
It's all your fault.
It's supposed to be, like, the biggest day of my life, you see?
My son is being born and I should be there, you know, instead of being stuck in a closet with you.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I expected that as much as you.
No no no, believe me.
Nobody expects that as much as me, okay?
And you know what's funny?
When this day is over, you'll go home with the baby, okay?
Where does this leave me?
You become the father of the baby.
Everyone knows who you are.
Who am I?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no ... lesbian party.
Every day is the day of lesbian love.
It's awesome.
Do you want to explain that?
I mean, well, because when I was growing up, you know my dad left, my mother died and my stepfather went to jail, so I just had enough pieces of parents to to make an integer.
And here is this little baby who has about three parents who care about it so much that they argue over who will love him the most.
And it's not even born yet.
That's right, it's just the luckiest baby in the world.
I'm sorry, you fought.

Ok, it's a typical apartment in New York City. Two girls are just hanging around.
Hi, how are you Kelly?
I am doing very well! My God, Tiffany, you feel so good!
It's my new perfume. Why do not you come closer where you can
Oh, you know Joey, you're sick!
It's disgusting!
I do not read this!
What?! Wait wait! The handsome man was about to enter !!

Okay, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
I mean he has the monocle, he has the top hat ...
Do you know he's gay?
I just want to clarify this: Are you leaving Mr. Peanut?
Danielle! Hi! Everyone is Danielle, Danielle, everyone.
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
So what
What?
What is it?
That she left you?
What does she like about women?
That she left you for another woman who loves women?
A little stronger, I think there is a man on the 12th floor in a coma who did not hear you well ...
So what?
My first time with Carol was ...
What?
It was my
With Carol? Oh.
So in all your life, you've only been with one - oh.
Whoah, my boy, hockey was a big mistake! We could have done a lot of things tonight!

Hi. Where is everyone?
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up - what's wrong?
My wedding, I think my wedding is uh, is a little over.
Oh no! Why?
Because Carol is a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently, it's not a mixed situation.
Oh my God! I do not believe it! Oh, poor bunny.
I am an idiot.
I mean I should see it, I mean Carol and I would be out and she would see it, she would see a beautiful woman and, and she would be Ross you know, look at her and I would think, God, my wife is cool!
Aw! Hey, do you think this Susan person is her lover?
Well, now I'm doing it !!
I am sorry.
Seven years.
I mean we have been together for seven years. She is the only woman to love me, and the only woman to have ...
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
I will do it.
No you will not do it.
Listen, he knows he's done something terrible and I think he's sorry.
But, you still have an excuse to make, okay, you have to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Ok, absolutely!
Okay.
You have it.
Cookie, now you can hit it!
What?!

Okay, that's all, I stopped.
What? I said nothing.
Yes, but it's not the face of a person who trusts a person.
Ok, it's the face of a person who, you know, does not trust a person.
I am sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than we had discussed.
Do you want to relax? I know what I'm doing. That's how he wears it.
Julie
What?!
Jody!
You were with Julie?
Look, when it started, I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.
And then one thing drove another and, before I knew it, we ... were shopping.
Oh. Oh my God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It did not mean anything to me.
Yes indeed. Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking about you all the time.
Listen, I'm sorry, okay.
I never wanted you to find out!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
This is not true!
Oh, so you sort of managed to leave it here?
Have you ever thought I could be so stupid?
Ok monica I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to

Hey!
Yeah!
I can not tell.
Why?!
Why not?
I can not say because he is famous.
Oh my God, who is it ?!
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
OK OK. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
As in Barbara Streisand's husband, James Brolin?
What?! Well, he never told me that!

In
Oh, this life! Oh ok no, Chandler is worse.
Dude, it must be so cool to remember things like that! I have no memory of past life.
Of course you do not do it darling. You are new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, do not tell this story.
Oh, come on!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey has Monica's turkey stuck to the head!
What?! Joey has a turkey stuck to the head ?!
Hey, it's not like it's ringing.
His

Wendy, we had an agreement! Yes, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was it?
Wendy bailed. I do not have a waitress.
Too bad. Bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon I wish I could, but I planned to walk.
You know, Rachel, when you missed your wedding, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if it does not tell you anything ... twenty dollars an hour.
Completed.

The reactor will explode in three seconds, we will never get there!
You have to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I will not leave you!
Do not worry about me, I'm a robot! I am only a machine !!
No you are not! Not for me!
Oh my God.
What?
I am
Yeah, you're great! Ok, let's take that
No, I mean I was really playing the ass.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh yes, you are solid. Yes, you're just not me.
You know what? I think that's enough for the moment. Yeah. I do not want to be repeated too much.
Well!
I will do it without you!
I do not need you or anyone else!
I will do it myself!
You will see!!
you will

I can not believe that Ross is gone. It's so sad.
I did not know Ross and you were so close.
We were not but we had a class together. He was a great guy and he spoke so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
And if the sky has a door, I'm sure he's hugging her ear and listening carefully.
I thought so much about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
But you did not do it!
I am still alive!!
Kori, I know it's a big surprise for you.
It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day!
I mean, the fact that you're here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
You're sick monster, who does that? I can not believe I have a crush on you!
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me !!

We will do a quick check.
Okay.
So eight days late huh?
Yeah.
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Hey, just a little bit.
You are cleared at about 80%, so you are on your way.
It could still last a little longer.
If you are worried, there are many ways to help things.
Make them !!
In fact, these are things you can do. Some home remedies, but in my experience, I have found that some of them are very effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Ok, there is an herbal tea that you can drink.
Okay.
What's wrong with Emma?
Oh, she misunderstood, she was thinking of moving to Tulsa.

Whenever you are ready.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Ok, where am I talking here?
I mean, uh, well, there's a way that seems to offer some acoustic benefit, but ...
Just aim at the hump.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, that's it.
You know, I, you know, I can not do that.
Uh, that's so weird.
I feel stupid.
So do not do it, it's good. You do not have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hi baby. Hello Hello.

Hi!
Oh hi. It's Mark.
Oh.
What? Is it my breath?
Ow!
Rachel?
Ow! Ow!
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Ok, I do it.
Okay.
I really do.
Okay, I'll get your coat and then I'll put you in a taxi.
Okay. Oh, wait, wait, are not you coming with me?
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Okay.
Okay?
Thank you. Oww !!!! God!
What?! What's wrong?
I'm sorry, I just can not go to the hospital with that appearance.

Pete Becker is spinning around the ring now. It looks like he's just trying to feel it. Oh, Bruiser is just ...
Run! Run crazy, rich monster!
Oh, I can not watch that.
Look, he wins! Pete wins!
Really?!
No-o-o !!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the web and is heading to his favorite area.
Oh! Oh!
Wait, if that's his favorite field, why is he so mean?
Well, it's ironic.
Among your last two friends, Richard did not want to have children, and as it seems, Pete can not anymore.
Dude, you do not have to boast! We have nothing here !!

Should we tell Rachel that there is an empty private room right next to hers?
We can or can have sex in it.
Well, let me think about it while I take off my pants!
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you would go out with him.
Oh! Oh, I think I'm going to throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.
What?!
What? I told myself that since you were pregnant, you will not see people.
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not a people. Secondly, what did he say when you told him that I was pregnant?
I did not tell her. I did not know if you told people. That's when I thought Kash was still a person.
Well, well, do not tell him. Do not tell him. Ask him to call me in agreement?
Look Rach, I really do not think it's such a good
Ok, you'll do it! I will come back to this set! I will meet more actors! I will meet them all!

Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua left then Emily and you are free to leave.
Its good.
She's still here to take advantage of her fake party and uh, it's too late to do what I expected, so
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, wait, wait, wait
You tell them to wait!
Okay. Expect! Expect!
Emilie.
Oh no-no-no! Oh no! No! No! Emily!

Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Okay.
I know. You are the guy who would not want to participate in the do-it-yourselfer.
It does not matter!
No, I actually thought it was unfair in the way everyone reacted. I mean, you just moved in.
I
Jen
Jen, I know it may sound a little bit But uh, maybe you want to have a coffee someday
Sure! It would be good.
Umm?
Oh! My number is there. Call me.
I called you.
I will see you later.
Okay!
I forgot my paper.

Here we go. Ok, get ready.
What?
Okay.
Ow!
Are not you going to go?
No thanks.
No, Rachel never pee in public toilets.
Well, they never have paper in you know. So, my rule is "no fabric, no stoned". If everyone goes there.
No, you know what does not close because the ... keys ... are in it.
Oh no no no no no no no!
What is going on?
My lighter is in it!
I promise.
Although, do not feel like you can not visit.
Hey, is Chandler here?
No, no he is not.
Joey, you just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I thought about that and I think the best way would be not to do it.
Joey, you can not keep this for yourself, if you know, you have to tell him.
It'll kill him. I mean it's okay, it's just going to kill him.
Well, you can wait until I go to the dentist, maybe

Hi!
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, ah ah, I was just wondering, when you and I separated, did you have the tape that was half of the last episode of
Oh yes, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Where is Ben?
He is sleeping.
Ahh Ooh, it's an ah, it's a bad time?
Uh, yeah, actually, Susan is going home in a moment, it's a bit of a birthday.
Oh! I thought you were married in January?
It's not that kind of birthday.
Ah! Oh.
Sooo !! Anyway...
Where are we going to find a little hat?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get "Rainy Day Bear" !!
Because he will know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Oh my god, oh my god, it's sown.
Give the. Give the.
Okay.
Oh!!
Oh, it's like a bloodbath here today.

Please. It's so much your fault.
How, how is it my fault?
Listen, Carol never threw me out of a room before you arrived.
Yeah? There are many things that Carol never did before I arrived.
Are you trying to be smart? A funny lady?
Do you know what is your problem? You are threatened by me.
Oh, am I threatened by you?
Yes.
Hey, hey, all right, all right!
Come in here.
Come on.
God, I do not believe you.
There are children who come into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should hear.
So stop screaming, stop!
Yes, Susan.
Do not force me to do it again, I do not like my voice like that.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?

Oh! It's here! Ooh Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I did not do this! Who would have done that ?!
Son of a bitch!
Ok, maybe ask this guy.
Oh, did not I mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin in a medical research project.
You know that sometimes good ideas are right in front of you, do not you?
Ok, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. You know? The only problem is, Carl's role is
the
Yes, it's the reason why I did not have this big
Hey, can I have a little piece of this cake?
Pizza!! We love pizza !! Get out !!!

Hey Monica, there is a customer who wants to complete the chef, should I let him in?
Of course, I love this part!
Enter.
Really? Right now, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment, yes.
But only in the moment. So you still want to kiss?
Of course, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.
Neither do I.
3, 2,
Joey, you do not have to count every time you kiss.
Uh, okay. Except that I felt like I needed a few seconds to get ready.

Wow Wow!
Yeah.
Well. Phoebe?
OK OK.
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would like, um, peace in the world, more hunger, good things for the rainforest ... And bigger breasts!
Yeah, you see .. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I would be omnipotent forever.
You see, there is always a guy. "If I had a wish, I would like to make three more wishes."
Hi Joey. Hi. Hey buddy.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill me!
..Excuse me?
Hey, if little Joey is dead, then I have no reason to live!
Joey, uh-
You

I am sorry.
Joey, on stage!
Can you at least stay until the end of the room?
I mean, I'll go to the airport with you, I-I mean bye.
Where are you Vic?
The flight is in an hour. I-I have to go.
Vic! Vic!
In a minute!!
So that's it? Victor?
Yes, I guess it is.
Look, I have to say goodbye, and I have to say quickly because it kills me.
One thing you should know is that I will never forget you.
But you have things to do now, and me too.
And so I'm going up on this spaceship, and I'm going to go to Blargon 7 looking for alternative fuels.
But when I come back, in 200 years, you'll be gone a long time ago.
But I will not have aged at all.
So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look at me, because Adrienne, baby, I'm going to want to meet her.
See you soon, Vic!

I must say
Nooo Way! The most romantic song is ever
See, I-I think the one that Elton John wrote for, uh, this guy on
What song was it, Pheebs?
Hi Monica!
Hey Mon!
Hey Mon!
Oh my God, did she sleep?
Nope.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Yes, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts on the terrace, then.
Oh, ok, that explains that.
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, for example, that high-pitched, squeaky sound, so I said okay, it's like a mouse or an opossum.
But then, I realized where a mouse or an opossum would have the money to make the phone call.

So, man, are you going to play with me tonight?
You know what, I do not know how much I'm going to see how hot sex is between a guy and your girlfriend.
yes I know but
Oh no-no-no, I'm here.
Hey!
Hey Mon! Do you want pancakes?
You made pancakes?
Yes! Take a plate.
Okay.
No, no, stay there. To get closer.
Okay, okay, but do not worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,
Look, too, we are watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come.
Oh yes!

Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yes, sandwiches to the hero.
Well, you all know that I am a pacifist and that the war does not interest me at all.
But what do you know?
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.
Not you Joey.

Oh my goodness
Hey! Continue counting down your favorite dishes. Tonight, # 3, cheese macaroni with cut hot dogs.
Look, you've done enough! Okay? You must stop this now.
I go! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to the tape you made for me.
Oh, the mixed band.
Your appearance tonight
You are just the sweetest.
No! You are the sweetest!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
What?
I check the restaurant with Pete.
Oh, Monica, I'm so excited for you.
Wait wait! Expect!!

So, darling, this three-um thing, I mean, how are you going to start finding
Ooh, actually, I made a list of all the women I know who could be involved in this task!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone did their homework.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know that Gail Rosten is there twice, but she's so
Oh, I know. You know, just just talking about it, it becomes a little
Oh me too.

and then, we could have gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Ross, that just would not have been feasible.
But having a ring on your finger would not have been a problem?
It was really fun to be married to you tonight.
Yeah! And! And it was the easiest 400 dollars I ever earned.
Ok Ross, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
This proposal, at the planetarium
I know, I know it was stupid.
Are you kidding?!
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!
It was really wonderful!
Have you just done that?
No, actually I thought about it when, when we went out.
That's how I imagined, I would ask you to marry me.
Well, it would have been very difficult to say no, too.
It's a good thing I did not do it because it seems like it would have been a very expensive wedding. OK good night
Good night
Even if the sidecar had a windshield so your hair would not be damaged?
I will think about it.
That's all I ask

Guys! It was bananas, cream and beef! I-I can not believe you've eaten that so I do not feel bad!
In fact, I did not eat mine. It's always in the bathroom.
No it is not, I ate that.
We left ours in Monica's room.
No, I understand and I have yours too.

Okay, so we went to the beach because Phoebe discovered this lady who knew her parents, and I do not really know what happened.
And I'm so happy that there is no problem.
In fact, I am a member of the hiring committee. There will be at least one friendly face.
Ohh! It's awesome!
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the
Really?!
No-ho-ho!
Yeah.
I mean, no-no-no-no, do not worry, I do not doubt that your qualifications will require you to sleep with a guy to get this job.
Although I may need to convince.
Well, I
Joke! God, I feel wild today!

Oh my God! Chandler has just left!
Yes, but maybe that's not what we think. Maybe it's telling Monica that I'm sorry I drank the last milk.
Or maybe he was writing to tell him that he had changed his name, you see? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I think that means he panicked and left!
Do not be so negative! Good God! Is not it possible that Sorry is sitting right now ?!
Okay. Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we going to do?
Listen Ok, I'm just going to have to go get him and bring him back!
Okay?
Make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Okay.
Okay
I will find it.

Hey!
Hi! Hey!
Do you know cute guys?
Yes of course! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh I am sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table so I have to go a little bit
What is charity?
I do not know, something about trees or disease, Ralph mumbles a lot.
Ralph mumbles when you're not careful?
Yeah! It's strange. But the thing is the need to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Hey!
What are you guys doing later?
Oh, Rachel and I have an appointment to get our hair cut.
We do?
I want to see what he wants first.
Okay.
I just discovered that Elizabeth's father wants to meet me.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's father ?!
Come on guys, I really want this guy to love me.
It would really help if you were there to make me look good.
Of course, we will help you! Yeah! We will be there!
Thank you!
We know how difficult these parent-teacher conferences can be.

Oh hi! How are you?
I'm fine. I have to go down to the police station and watch the rants.
Oh.
Thank you for inviting me, guys.
Label?
Are you going?
Uh we did not have, uh we did not have a chance to talk.
Uh, so where are you from?
Colorado.
Ah, what are you good at?
Listen, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay.
Ah, I-I should never have said what I said.
What do you know?
It does not matter what I feel.
I mean, we work together, so nothing could ever happen between us, and what I'd like to do is just go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about it again, okay?
Uh, I'm not.
Oh, my god, I knew it, I panicked you.
No, you did not do it The only thing that scared me was that nothing could ever happen between us.
Really?
Yeah, so please, do not shoot me for that.
Okay, well, it's one less thing we have to do Monday.

Grab it! GRAB IT! Grab it! Get-YESSS! You do not laugh, huh!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of guys without teeth who hit each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!
It is open!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, listen, we're on this thing on TV!

I'm so excited that I kept this chair for me!
Yeah me too.
Hey, how's the miracle chair?
Well.
Yeah? Wow! You know, this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Not really?
Yeah! You can connect it to your TV
My chair is healing itself.

Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study last night?
Yes! Yes I did it.
So do Iceberg!
G-sharp.
g
What?! I did not touch a guitar!
No, but you question my method!
No, I do not ask myself a question, I say it's stupid! What?!
Thank you.
You know that none of my other students thought I was stupid.
Your other pupil, it was you!
Yeah, well, you know maybe you just have to try a little harder!
Listen, I may need to try a real teacher!
Right here!
Right here!
Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and looks ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and
Well! You will learn from your qualified instructor! But do not come crying when everyone is tired of hearing you play
"The meanest man in all this damn town."
Oh good! Take his part!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey has to work. Now come!
Hey!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this feedback when all five pages are complete! Ahh!

Hi!
Hi.
Hi. Umm, I think there is something we really need to talk about.
I think we do. Why do not we go inside? Listen, I know why you're here.
You do?
Yes, and to avoid embarrassment, I think I should perhaps speak first.
Okay.
Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. It's a hell of a saw, is not it?
What?
I mean, look, that night was fun and certainly passionate, but do not you think it would be better if we stayed friends?
Seriously. What?!
Okay.
Okay.
You know what?
If you wish, we can do it once again.
I mean, I would agree with that.
In fact, I have some time now.
Ok, you know what? May I, can I speak now?
Oh, of course.
I am pregnant. Ross? Ross? Ok, every time you are ready. And you're the father by the way, but you have that

We should definitely play football more often. Maybe we could join a similar league or something.
I know!
Yes! Wow, well, it was easy. Ok, you are going.
Okay.
Okay.
Ok, you know, you know when you're in bed with a woman.
Hmph.
And, ah, you know, you're having fun with it.
And you have all those things, mental pictures in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at Xerox ....
With the navel ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, and all of a sudden, your mother falls on your head.
And your kind 'Mom, get out of here!'
You know, but of course, afterwards, you can not think of anything else, and you can not stop what you are doing.
So it's a bit like, you are, you know.
You know .... You do not know!
Your mother, your you tell me, you tell me about your mother, what's wrong with you?
You said...
I said '

Oh!
Look at Emma!
I can not decide who she looks more like, Rachel or you?
Oh, are you kidding? She is beautiful, that's all Rachel.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why are not you together yet?
No, I know.
I know, because you are not there.
Which would be nice, except that you are totally.
It's complicated, okay?
Yeah that's right. Yes, you love him. You always have. You have a child together. There is no good answer.
Look, we have been together.
Okay?
And then apart, then together, then apart, and now we have a baby.
It's just so-if we got together and it did not work I could never do that to Emma
I mean she-she thinks of everything- Oh it's me now.
What are they putting something in the water at this place?
Since Rachel and I are doing really well, we are doing really well now.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more, you could destroy it.
Yes exactly.
Right. Or you could get everything you wanted since the age of fifteen.

God. I forgot how much I like to drive. I have
You do not have
Oh Ross, you're so tense! You just have to relax, okay? Just need to relax, okay? Just need to relax
What are you doing?! Do you agree, it's not funny! Just stop walking!
I do not walk around, okay? I am Porsche.
Uh-oh.
Ok, stay calm. Nothing will happen to you, you do not have so many problems.
Really? You think?
I was talking to myself! You descend!

Hello Darling! I missed you today!
Oh yes?
Yeah. What do you want to do tonight?
Oh, well ... maybe we could ...
Ok, I try to excite myself by doing a bazaar?
Know your audience!
In addition, tomorrow we are doing these fertility tests and by then you must keep your tadpoles in the bin.
We really need to pass these tests?
Honey, we have been trying to have a baby for over a year.
I think it's a good idea to know if everything is fine. Just a few routine tests.
But I do not want to do it in a cup!
Oh, Hi Max! Hey, do you know everyone?
Did you see David?
No, no, he was not around.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Minsk?
Minsk. It's in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We had the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
So when will you go?
January 1.

You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Yes. Yes! Please, enter.
Oo-oo!
Pretty good! Except that I had a little attitude of the robot.
Damn these robots, they are supposed to be our
Anyway, it was not the robot, it was the guy who controlled it.
Yes, he does not love me.
He was C.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.
topple the sandwich just when I was looking for one!
Ohh!
Why do not you fire him?
I have to do it, I hate to do it, but I'm the star!
You know?
There is a limit to the number of sandwiches I can eat on the floor.
Excuse me.
Joey Tribbiani.
Joe! I'm happy to have found you, I have an audition for you!
Wow!
The thing is, it's a bit on Q.T.
The actor who has the role does not know he can be fired.
This is the main role of a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I am the leader in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!
Uh-oh!

Oh, God! If you want a baby so bad, go steal it!
What's going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies. I am crazy about ourselves.
What?
Look, we always talked about having babies one day.
I'm not saying it has to be now, but I'm starting to think we can deal with it.
Was good.
We are really good.

Oh, did you catch it ?!
Uh-huh.
What did he say?!
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda." Of course, I could not give him my real name?
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw how he came out of here!
What do you think?
He will stay and talk to the girl he abandoned!
What did you tell him?
Well, I said, I told him you know, that I was Francis's executor and that I had to talk to him so I could meet him at the cafe later.

Oh yes, of course.
Ok, in ten seconds you'll see him kiss me.
And in about five seconds, you'll see why.
Ross, did I ever tell you how long I went to Europe?
Ok, get ready to see some!
Oh, you came to Ross!
What?!
Now I am so happy.
What are you talking about?!
You used the history of Europe!
This is the magical story you use when you want to make love!
How do you know this story ?!
How to do
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from a guy!
A guy!!
No, she told me that her name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams !!

How are you, are you ready?
Mom has already called this morning to remind me not to comb my hair. Did you know that my ears are not my best asset?
Some days, that's all I can think of.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I could not find myself.
Oh ... all right, all right.
But euh ...
I just have a question for you, ehm ...
When we go out, should we walk, or run, or prance, or wander ...
Stop, stop! He speaks slowly but he could pee quickly! OK, let's go!!

I can not believe that! How long does it last?
Well, um, Alexandra was
Oh, that has a name?
Phoebe, do not get angry!
Ok-oop! Too late! I leave! Come on Chandler let's go!
Well, Phoebe, I thought - Yeah, but God

Ben!
Oh it's good. Maybe he will hear you and pull the cord.
Stop the bus! Expect! Expect! Expect!
Are you sure he did not break it because it really hurts?
No, it's just a good bone blue. And here is the flat wound of your ring.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry!
Hey!
Hey!
I got my s!
That we can celebrate later.
Celebrate.

Ok, Paulo, why do not you just get dressed, and then you'll be on the way, okay, goodbye.
Rachel, how did this happen?
I do not know, I just met him a little bit last night.
Or?
At home Is this juice?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dropped him because he hit Phoebe?
Oh my God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
I licked my arm, what?
It's breast milk.
So?
Phoebe is a person's squeezed juice.
What is the big problem?
What have you just done?
Ok, would people stop drinking breast milk?
You will not even taste it?
No!
Not even if you claim it's milk?
Not even if Carol's chest bore the picture of a missing child.

Aww!
Now that's funny.
Hey Pheebs, could you please do not set foot on my new old sheet?
Oh, of course! Noo!
Ohh !!
My apothecary table !!!
What?!
Noooooo !!
Ross, where did you get this ?!
I had it at
Oh my god, Phoebe,
Wow! Oh my God, well, if they snatched our table, ours must cost well over fifty dollars!
Oh yes.
It does not even smell of opium.
Of course not, it smells of the wine you have spilled! And thank you for destroying my sheet by the way.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.

How is she?
It's too early to say. She is resting, which is a good sign.
How are the hair?
I'm not going to lie to you, Ross, it does not look good.
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped curling.
Can we see it?
Your hair is too beautiful, I think it would upset her. Ross, why do not you come?
Yeah.
How are you?
Of course, the packaging appeals to adults and children.
Ross, you're stupid. I tried, it does not matter. Just taste.
It would be no.
Come on. It does not have bad taste.
Yeah, it's a little nice, kind of, uh ...
Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
Did you taste it? You have tasted it.
Uh huh
Oh, you have tasted it.
You can continue to say it, but it will not stop being true.
Give me the bottle. Give me the towel.

I still do not understand why Greg and Jenny gave us a fake number.
You know, if they knew what they were doing, they probably did not give you real names either.
Ok, maybe people give fake numbers, but they do not give false names.
Oh yes? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Regina Philange.
I still do not understand, we did not do anything wrong.
I know! Although you have told a lot of jokes.
I thought these jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Joke. Joke. BLA bla! BLA bla!
Well, maybe it was all your questions.
What about my questions?
No I am sorry. It's just that my foot itches like crazy.
Oh, I'll get it.
Wow! In general, I know a girl a little better before letting her spoon me.
Relax, we are not poking.

Look at this! Ohhh! The wallpaper is a little faded, it's good. The carpet is a little loose. Hardwood floors !!
Hey!
Hello.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It is so beautiful.
I know!!!
So, here I am, ready to play.
Okay.
I brought a lot of things for the house, so take a look at it. Ha-ha.
What is this?
It's a dog, every house should have one.
Not the one who can piss on the roof.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built with radioactive waste.
And is it in case the house sneezes?
No, no, it's the ghost of the attic.
I do not want a ghost.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you have one, because the house is located on an old Indian cemetery.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an old Indian cemetery? It would never happen.
Okay, of course, you know little about the US government.
Hey!
Hello.
I need to talk to you!
Of course, what's up?

Okay, I just changed in thirty seconds so you could be alone with him. You better go.
Please, I'm not going for nothing.
Well, if you do not do it, I'll do it.
Would you please go?
I would like!
Hey, guys, did you see my new bathroom ?!
Uh-huh.
Look look.
Ooohhhh !!
And and!
Ahhhh !!
Hey, my dad's house does that!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
The movie was great, the dinner was great and nothing beats a cool, cool evening in New York.
Hmm.
Of course, I could not take advantage of all that, because Joanna is such a

Okay. It's Emma
Emma! See? I do not want it.
Take it.
What?
It's clearly an Emma.
Oh honey, but you like that name.
Yes, but I love you more.
Besides, you know, nothing's wrong with Bing.
So I'm screwed.
I mean Oh, hi Emma.
Yes it's you.
You are our little Em.
Oh what's this darling?
What?
Oh, do you want a little cousin?
Do you want a cousin now?
!

Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I'm going, "Quack, quack!" I am happy all the time!
Good try.
Wait wait!
Look, Monica
Look!
It will not work.
I bet it'll work!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can not believe that!
No I do not have!
Yes you can!
No I do not have!
You love Me!
No, I do not do! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that!

Hello Greg?
Hi, is Monica from the plane?
Listen, the number you gave me 853-5 This is their old number!
Jenny gives it since they moved!
Jenny! It's so Jenny!
Hey, listen, how would you like to meet?
Say next Saturday?
Ok, why not Sunday?
Ok, uh, the week after?
The week after that?
What do you know Greg?
You know what?
We are good, interesting, funny people with

Hey Chandler! You know, that girl you went to college with, who became a director?
Oh yes, Dana Keystone. She was in my movement class.
What is a movement class?
This is Chandler's way of pretending he did not take a mime.
Oh, listen, she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You must pass me an audition!
Oh, I do not know, man. I have not spoken to him for ten years.
I am.
Joey, what are you talking about? You are a great actor.
Do you really think that?
Ugh, how can you even ask this question ?!

Ross! Get a shot of this. (He wears a number from
Oh, all right, I have another one!
This one does not hurt either-Ooh, yes it does!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ooh!
Oh, I was hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Okay. Hey, but it'll make me really good. Oh, and something else, the video camera? Pleasant!!

Yes I love you. Okay goodbye! Hi!
Hi!
It was Alice's mother, she said she left since five o'clock. She should be here now!
Oh, honey, do not worry. She will arrive on time.
Yeah.
I guess I set up the video camera to try to attract Joey.
But unfortunately, I could not be attracted.
Unbelievable! I mean, did you really keep Joey's underwear ?! Why? Why would you do that ?!
I am Monica. I am disgusting. I track down guys and keep their underwear.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who is disgusting and who is not.
Huh?
Well, now, I'm going back to my bucket.
I'm just eating the skin, so the chicken is up for grabs.

I did not find anything at Joey's place - Hey, hey!
Oh, all right, they gave you the prices of the old days.
Yeah.
Well, what period is it?
Uh, that's old. As in the old days. You know?
Yes yes I
My God, oh it's just perfect!
Wow!
I bet there is also a nice story behind her.
Did they tell you anything?
As you know where it came from or
Yes! I know it comes from White Plains.
White plains. Oh, it sounds like a magical place.

So you still do not think I'm a friend?
Huh?
I saw you watching me during the match last night.
I, shut up!
Goodbye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your mother lives in Montauk. You just wrote that!
Well, that's pretty much the point. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Noooo !!
Okay, hang in there!

Rachel, it'll happen. Chandler will move in here.
But I
No-no, wait!
Let me just finish, okay?
It's not something we just did, we just decided impulsively in Vegas, it's something we both want.
And that
It is? Really?
Yes my darling.
I mean we are not, we will not live together anymore?
No.
What? Oh my God! I will miss you so much!
I'll miss you!
I mean, it's the end of an era!
I know!

Why do all coffee mugs have numbers at the bottom?
Oh. That's why Monica can keep track. So, if one of them is missing, she can say, "Where is the number 27 ?!"
You know what?
It does not have.
Ok, so what you had with Rachel is what I have with Alice.
Now, what is it?
It's so cool, man, it's just because being with her is so much better than not being with her.
Yeah yeah.
Why do not I find that?
Do not ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Well, I want it!
You can have it!
I do not know, maybe I can not. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Oh no! No!
It's outside the man! I saw it! J? have understood !!
So you hold it !!
Okay, man !!
Okay, congratulations, lucky bastard!

Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
Push!
Push them, push them, stronger, stronger.
Push them, push them back, get out!
Let's get this ball and move really, hey, hey, ho, ho.
I was just-yeah, that's right.
Push!
Push!

Okay.
Ross, did not you say there was an elevator here?
Uh, yes I did it but there is none. Ok, here we go.
Ok, go left. Left! Left!
Ok, you know what? There is no more left, left!
Oh ok, lift it over your head!
Right over your head!
You can do it!
You can do it!
Okay.
You got it?
Oh, ok, I understand.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just that I never even
Howard is the
Yes but also me he is right, man.
Ok, ok, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ugh, can you believe this guy!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.

Ohh!
What?
He launched! I think the baby hit!
Oh my God!
Oh no, wait, oh no, the elastic of my underwear broke.
Oh my God! I slept too much! I had to be on the set half an hour ago! I have to get out of here!
Oh, wait, Joey, you can not go that way! You stink!
Listen, I know I fell asleep before I could shower and now I do not have time!
They are only ten blocks away, if I run, I can get there.
You arrive in the whole room! I am Chandler.
Hi.
Hi.
It bothers you if I
No, I beg you.
So, what are you going to do?
I speak in my sleep.
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
So, why do not you give me your number?

Previously in Friends.
I do not know exactly. It's a bit like the fight.
Oh?!
Yes, but without the costumes.
Oh.
And that's not wrong, it's totally brutal.
Yes, there are two guys in a ring, and the rules are: 'They are
So you can love, bite and pull people's hair?
Yeah, everything goes, except ah, fishing for the eyes and fishing for fish.
What is fish fishing?
Uh, what catches the fish ... Thanks man, it would have been really hard to describe. What is this taste?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave a duck bath.

Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lips to keep from shouting your name.
It makes me feel so good.
It was so clumsy and bumpy.
Bumpy?
Well, maybe he had some kind of cool new style that you do not know well.
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Well, there was really not much time to get used to it, do you know what I mean?

Come across! Oh! Come across! Oh! Hi! Hi! No! Right! Come across!
Oh, it's not that bad.
Yes, most damage is rather contained in the bedrooms.
Oh!
My God!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Excuse me?
Joey! He works! You would look
Oh, how?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing that is not burned is a donkey. What I do
How's your room Rach?
Everything is in ruins. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Is not it mine?
Well! My condolences!
So uh, you can not live here for a while, you have a place to stay, ladies?
Wow! Oh ok, look buddy, I'm
Yes, they can stay with us.
Did you understand what triggered Mr. Fireman's fire?
There is so much pressure.
I mean no offense, but what you do is very different.
I do not know if you understand.
Yes, none of us have to deal with job pressures.

Phoebe, you have to do something!
Well, you know.
I mean, it's impossible for Joey to succeed in time.
So I will go through the hotel and see if there are other weddings going on.
Okay. Oh, but do not tell them Monica is pregnant because she frowns.
Okay.
Okay.

What's all about you fighting ?! Is it really over a room ?! I mean, it's so stupid!
Ross, we can handle that.
Apparently no, and I can not stand there and watch two people who matter to me being very hurt for something so stupid.
I mean, enough of foolishness!
Well, why do not you tell him to stop being stupid!
OK OK!
Two very good points, look, I have known you both for a long time and I have never seen you or a millionth of people as happy as you have been since you were together.
Do you really want to throw everything in a room?
It's so stupid.
Now what is more important, love or stupidity?
Well, we love foolishness, but we also have a weakness for love.
Love is the best medicine.
It's laughter.
Why are you doing this?
I do not know.
Okay! Okay! Chandler, you want to live with Monica, do not you?
Yes I do.
And Mon, you want to live with Chandler, do not you?
Yes.
Well! A verbal contract is mandatory in the state of New York!

Oh.
But I do not Phoebe Me.
Well, I'm not at all surprised that this is the case.
You are not? You see, that's why you're so great!
In fact, it's, it's quite, you know, a typical behavior when you have that kind of dysfunctional group dynamics.
You know, that kind of co-addict, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid cafe with your stupid big cups that, I'm sorry, might just as well have had nipples on, and you're just like me!
Defined me!
Love me, I need love!
.

Have you really done this before?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
You just take a big, big swing.
Now, do not hold back.
and Phoebe takes a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing when Chandler and Monica enter.)
Hey!
Hey hey!
What are you doing?
We are just celebrating that Joey has regained his health insurance.
Ah. Very good.
Yeah! Sure! Yes! Oh, you know what? If I heard a shot now, I would throw you my body.
Oh yes? Well, maybe you and I should walk in a poor neighborhood.
Okay!
Okay.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Cut it out Ross! I hate to save your life and kick your ass the same day!

Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yeah.
Listen, I would prefer you do not call me Joey.
Since I do not know anyone here, I thought it would be cool to try a cool job nickname.
Hey, dragon! Here are your tips for Monday and Tuesday.
There are like-there are like 300 dollars in this one!
Yes, people get pretty generous during the holidays. And it's never bad to wear tight pants.
Okay.
Could the waiters get together to hear tonight's specials?
Okay, first there is a Chilean bar made with a taste of mango on a bag.
Because we can remember it.
Because you're going to invent fake specials and cook them like you did the other night?

Hey. When you were kids and you played
I have always been Joanne.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighborhood?
Ewww! Oh! It's the king of mattresses!
Booo !!
Do not look darling. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Expect! Expect! I want to see that. After my divorce, half of this kingdom will be mine.
What a wank!
Oh, I can not believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I know!
And ninety-nine years for a set of top-cushion sheets, who cares about divorce, these babies will sell themselves.
And I am dismayed for you by the fact.

You had to do it, did not you? You can not just leave that alone.
Four percent. Okay. I give more than tips when there is an insect in my food.
Ross, tonight it was pretty much that you got along well. Oh, would you already like to see my chiropractor?
Yes, I will go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
I'm panicking!
Monica trusted me in something and she should not have!
Okay, I have not lived here for a while, so I have to ask you something.
Does Monica always light the lights in her room?
Hum Yeah.
I am
Ok, listen, here's the final result, Ross, it's repairable, if we act quickly, okay.
So, I'll invite him to tomorrow's brunch and you can prepare a good meal.
Look, darling, I tried to do good, it does not work.
Ok, listen, Ross, I realize that my father is difficult, but that's why you have to be the tallest man here.
Look at my sweetheart, I could be the greatest of men, I could be the greatest of men, I could be a tall, huge giant man, and that would still make no difference, except that I could take your father and tell him me!
Like me, little doctor!
Ok, can not you try it again, Ross? For me? For me?
Rachel a brunch will not solve anything. You have to face it, all right, we will never get along.
Ok, well, you'll get some too, okay.
Because I already have a mother and father who can not stay in the same room together, all right, I do not want to have a separate room for you too!
!
Okay, okay, okay. I'm going to get the bagels.

Ok now Joey, you know that since you report all this after the audition, you will have to wear underwear?
Okay, so you better show me some of it too.
Ok, something is missing. Ooh, I know! Uh, okay.
Really? A handbag?
This is not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's handbag.
No Joey, listen. Believe me, all men wear them in the spring catalog. Look. Look see,
Look see,
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.
No! No Joey! Unisex.
Well, I'm not going to say no to that.

So, did you tell your parents?
No, but it's okay, they're pretty cool, so my brother is straight. . .
Here you are.
You know what, I just have another question, uh, if you had understood that earlier and uh, I had been around, do you think I would have been?
.
.
no, uh, I'm sorry, do not tell me, I do not think any of these answers would make me feel better.
I love you Phoebe.
So your brother is all right huh? Seriously.

Hey!
Hi.
I just came to do nothing. So this weekend, it's a bit bad, huh?
Yes, it did.
So, I guess it's over.
What?
Well, you know, you and me, it had to end one day.
Why exactly?
Because of the weekend, we quarreled.
Chandler is crazy!
If you give up every time you argue with someone, you'll never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
So, it's not over?
You're too cute!
No.
No, it was a fight.
You take care of it and move on!
There is nothing to panic about.
Really? Okay. Awesome!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We are a couple?
I'm pretty scared
Okay.

Hi!
So, you like better short hair.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Can I tell you a little secret?
Yeah!
I want to keep one.
Oh, I'll be on the news!

Oh, please.
What? Honey.
Oh, yes, my side still hurts since you crushed me yesterday.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I know.
Ow !!
Oh my God!
Hey guys! Guess what?
Do you have a job on a river boat?
You know that I have not been wearing this costume for a year because you hated it. Well guess what? You're not my girlfriend then ...
Oh I see, so this costume makes a point.
Right.
Now that you are free, you are free to appear as stupid as you wish.
Do you like that?
Oh absolutely. I love him even more for you than for Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I am kidding!
Yeah, come here!
What were you going to tell us?
Yeah. Oh! How did you invent cotton gin ?!
Okay goodbye!

Hey, I have one! I have one!
Hi!
Hi.
Oh uh, up or down?
Oh, please, please. I hate to be a drummer, can I?
Could you please support as well?
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Oh yes? How was yours?
Well, it's a long story.
It is a bit embarrassing.
Let's just say that there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
And you?
Car accident.
Oh.
Oh, let me guess that an idiot on a cell phone was not paying attention?
Yeah. Me. Oh hey, it's me. Hey, I guess you just visited someone.
Yeah yeah.
Well, uh, if you have one day and maybe you want to visit someone else
Oh yes! I-I would like that.
I'm in the middle
Expect! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Uh, you have to press the button.

Oh, we did it and you still have all your lamps.
Oh, I did not take into account the tourist tax.
Oh man, do not worry about that, I found a maid's car unattended. We are way ahead of the game.
Oh my God.
What?
There is something new in the bowl.
Look, we've got enough, we're leaving.
No, but I want ... I want pine cones!
There is a forest just outside.
It's not the same thing.
Ok, go quickly!
Thank you for this pleasant stay.
Oh, my maple candy!

Oh my God, what happened?
Oh. My god, crazy Chandler. He spun me ... off ... of ... bed!
Wow! Running it sounds funny.
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's hug and roll.
Ross is what?
You know what, where he kisses you and takes you off a bit and ... Oh ... my ... my God.

Oops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! It's my father, it's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting very dashing.
Go easy - if you want, there are cookies on the counter, or - or - sangria! I can do sangria!
No, no, sorry. The cookies are good, thank you.
Oh.
Well, then, uh, anyway, uh, I was looking for my dad, and uh, did you hear from him or did you see him?
Oh no, I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everyone after high school.
Oh ok. So tell me everything about my parents. All.
Ohh well. You know, we were always together, in fact, they had a nickname for us three.
Oh what? what was that?
The three losers.
Oh, poor Lily.
Ohh, you know, I heard about what happened, it must have been terrible for you, to lose your mother that way.
Yeah, no, it was great.

Okay, we've already tried to feed her, change her, beat her, oh, try this one!
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Well, it's something that says to try to hold the baby close to your body and then rotate it quickly from one side to the other.
Okay.
It worked!
Oh oh no just stopped throwing up a bit.
Oh come on, what am I going to do, it's been hours and it keeps crying.
Uh, she Rachel, not her.
Yes, I'm not so sure.
Oh my god, I'm losing my mind.
Yeah, no kidding, it proves that nothing can be good to have sex with Ross!

Well, you are not.
Oh, it's so easy for you, I mean, you're not married, you can sleep with whoever you want!
Yeah I can! And do not think I do not, because I do it! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Monica Have you, did you do it right?
Of course I have! What do you think, I am a virgin at 30?
Oh my God! You are a virgin of 30 years!
Say it louder, I do not think the guy quite at the back has heard you!
It's not like I have no opportunity.
I mean, you know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
I see this guy Roger, okay?
It's not perfect, but I think maybe I should finish it.
You know, give him my flower.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you waited
You know what? You are right?!
Yes!!
I mean sex should not be a big problem!
There should not be all these rules and restrictions!
You know, people should be able to sleep with who they want, when
Rachel! I'll never think it's normal for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!

Push, push!
We are here!
Where have you been?
Long story, darling.
All right, Carol, you have to keep pushing. I need to apologize, could I have that?
Come on come.
Behind the back of my brother? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you will not hear from me.

So, I hear, you hate me!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about it.
A little bird told me something about you wanting to tear your arm out and throw it to me.
And you have a "hate" of that ?! You make a big jump there ...
Agree, agree, agree, agree, agree, agree, we need to do something to fix our little situation here, Joey.
So here's my idea: you and I spend quality time together.
But what will it do ...
For Chandler!
Guess what, I had an audition!
Awww, one of my students had an audition. I am so proud.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for that?
You bet! What is the part?
Oh that's great, it's a role on

Hi! Hi! Hi. Has anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you.
He was with me, uh, we play a little game, see? Hide and seek.
You can not ask my son, it's cheating.
You're right, thank you for keeping me honest dad.
Well, it's better not to come here. He can not see the bride in the wedding dress.
If I remember the time we got married, I saw the groom in a wedding dress.
But it was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Honey, this is not luck.
Oh my God! Monica!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doing?
Awesome. He is doing very well. Do not worry about Chandler.
Are you OK?
Uh-huh.
Yes baby!
I'm really glad you were fine, but I keep thinking about what would happen if you had both been connected.

So, we had a good time at the strip club, right?
Oh yes, it was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress in the area stops to teach the third
I can not believe! He still has not called.
Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
What, he does not like Josh?
No I do not.
Okay, well, I'll put on my tracksuits.
Oh no!
Expect!
Expect!
Ok, you know what, you were right, you were right.
We really were not good at being guys, but you know why?
Because we are girls.
Phoebe, her music could not
Thanks thanks.
Yes, I lost it.
You know, I'm not going to play anymore, do you want to finish my set?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Yes, as I could
What?
I played intentionally bad guys.
Ok, so you were trying to play badly all this time.
Yeah-no, just this last song.

Oh, I thought I had people for the game.
Oh yes, who plays?
The players.
Someone seems to miss being the hostess.
Please, it's a relief, that's what it is, that's what it is.
Very good Pheebs, hold your plate!
Oh.

Whatever?
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he did not hear from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Did you tell them he was missing?
No! I gave the impression that I was just calling to discuss. Of course, they both think I'm interested in them.
Who's is this?
I do not want to say.
Oh, come on! I do not care! Come on! Who's is this?
Diane Keaton.

Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why are not you still dressed ?!
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Look at this.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now, I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Really?!
Oh it's so exciting!
Thank you!
Thank you Monday!
Oh, but on Monday, if you still touch my guitar, I'll have to hammer you a little bit.
Pretty good, now, get ready!
Okay.
I'm going to get everyone, finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh, apparently, I opened the door to the past.

My best shoes, everything is fine for me.
I wear them every day.
Low heel, holes in the toes.
Do not worry about what people say.
The best friends of my feet, the friends at the end.
With them, I'm a hot chicky.
Although late one night, not much light, I ....
I got into something nasty.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time, I'll ... avoid the ...

My God, it's going to be so weird like when I come home and you're not here.
You know?
More than Joey and Chan.
No more than J and C.
"Do you want to go to Joey and Chandler's?"
"I can not, it's not there."
Listen, I'm just going to be through the hallway, we can always do the same thing.
Yes, but we will not be able to enjoy getting up in the middle of the night and talking at length about our feelings and the future.
We did not do that once.
Hi.
Hey!
Hi.
So I told Rachel that we would both be.
Oh yes? How did she take it?
Really good. Yeah. Surprisingly good. Yes, she did not cry. She was not angry or sad.
Uh-huh.
I will not do that.

Okay, if you need a vacuum cleaner, it's in my closet on the left. Oh, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
Okay, okay, but Rachel's going to be here too, can not I ask her that stuff?
Yeah, all right, try it!
Okay! Let's do it!
Woo-hoo !!
Yeah, darling!
London baby!
Hi!
Hi!
Monica? What time is it?
Uh, 9 years old.
But it's dark outside.
Well, it's because you always sleep until noon, idiot! Here is what looks like 9.
I guess I'll wash myself then. Look at this sunrise.
I am
I know me too.
Hey!
You know, if we went for a weekend?
You know we would not have any breaks and we could be naked all the time.
The whole weekend? It's a whole naked pile.
Yes, I can say that I have a conference and you can say that you have a chef thing.
Oh, I always wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey!
Okay, you do not know if. Let's go.
Expect! And for Joey?

Oh, there is also a book by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is it?
It seems like two people really appreciate the Dewey decimal system.
I am really sorry!
Sorry!
You did not bring

Hey!
Hi!
Oh you know, uh Kash, you really liked the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
Okay, I just have to go home first.
To save the game? You do this every time Ross, you're
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment has become available.
Oh, are you changing apartments?
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Yes, but when the baby comes, she will want to move.
She is?
Yeah, you did not expect her to live with a baby there, would you?
I guess I did not really think about it.
Ezel! Hey Gunther! You are an ezel!
Damn it!

Look what I have! Look what I have! Look what I have! Can you believe they are doing this for the little people?
Few people from the village.
Ok, look at this one. It is my favorite.
Oh, that's so nice!
I know! Phoebe will love to dress them up!
Huh. Except that Phoebe will not be the one to dress them.
Because she will not be able to keep babies.
Oh my God! We are launching the most depressing baby shower of all time!
Wait a minute!
Unless we give her all the presents she can use once her pregnancy is over.
Like-uh, ordinary coffee, Tequila.
Oh, and someone can get those leather pants she always wanted!
Oh, she'll love it!

Ok both of you ask the court a cancellation?
Yes, your honor, and here are forms, all filled.
So, on the basis of your motion, you are asking for an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Well, I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is an injection drug user.
What?!
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Crack is not even an intravenous drug!
Well, you would know it.
Now, it is also said here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh, come on!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
No!
Phoebe, just because I'm alone, does not mean I want to walk naked.
I mean, you live alone, you do not walk naked.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?

I know, I lied! I did not want her to think that I was a terrible mother! I can not even see my own baby!
Oh of course, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look here come look, that's it, it's right there.
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Do you really?
No, I do not see it!
Come on! Come on! Well, okay, okay, do you see that? This little thing that looks like a peanut?
Yeah.
Honey, that's it.
That's all? Well, I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thanks.
You are welcome.
Wow! I can not believe it's our baby.
Yes, it's our baby.

Gin.
We played Gin? You know, if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Do you want to stop!
Okay. Okay.
Ok, all right, I think you're great, I think you're nice, and you're smart, and I love you.
But you'll always be the guy who pissed on me.

Hey!
Hey!
Let me tell you about this girl with whom I scored last night! Oh no wait a minute it was you!
Hi, discover me, I'm a slut!
So you want to do something tonight?
Oh, I can not. Dr. Roger is coming again.
Oh.
Oh yes!
Right!
Because you always see him and uh, he's a good guy.
I mean, I remember a moment where
Are you OK?
Yeah! Totally! Totally and you?
Awesome! It's so amazing! I mean, the last time Dr. Roger came, I was
I bet he can.
You know, I do not have an appointment, but I could use a physics. Are you sure you are well?
Oh yes! Yeah! Do not worry about me, it'll be fine!

You have clean clothes. Now it's the important part.
Oh, I guess. Except that everything looks like jammies now.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this basket.
Yes, but if it is not? And if there is a reason we can not have a baby?
Oh, Chandler, listen. Monica and you must have children. I'm sure it'll be fine.
oh, oh, all right, thanks.
I can not believe I did not even think about that.
I guess I was so worried about having to ... come here and do ... "that" ...
What, you can do it on the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can not do it at a doctor?
It was a "Wendy's !!"

... and then Zana, just leave a tear !!
Listen, not that I like to talk about the people I went to high school with, because I do, but maybe we could talk about something else?
Like you, I do not even know where you work?
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a

Hey.
Hey!
So you stole my joke and you stole my money.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy storyteller that I'm a published writer.
Well, she'll know you stole the joke.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me there?
Yeah!
Well, I will not go now anyway.
Okay .
Here you are.
Ah, Gunther, I can not pay for it now because I do not work, so I had to reduce my luxury, like paying for things.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Euh, I do not know.
You see, it's just, see, I was a regular on a soap opera you know?
And to go from that to that, I come, plus, I would have to wait for all my friends.
Okay, but the money is good, plus you can watch Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a server. May I use the phone?

I do not have a name
Well, how are we supposed to call you?
Ok, for now, you can call me, Clint, temporarily.
No way you're cool enough to shoot Clint.
Ok, so what name am I cool enough to shoot?
Uh, Gene.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
See you later, Gene.
Goodbye, Gene.
It's Clint!
What's going on with Gene?

Welcome to Las Vegas.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Yes I did it. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
I hope you had a good flight.
Ohh, it was the best!

Oh, Larry.
Umm, do the health inspectors work on the commission?
No, bribes.
It's good to laugh, no?
Come on Joey !!!
Rachel, I told you everything I knew last night!
Listen, it's not a big deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I can not believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler make love.
No! I mean come on! It's a
I do not know.
Is he romantic with her?
I do not know.
Are they in love?
I do not know.
You know nothing.
Ohh, I know one thing!
What?
They did it on the couch.

Excuse me, listen, we've been here for over an hour and many less sick people than my friend have come in.
I mean, this guy with the toe thing?
Who is he sleeping with?
Oh, come on Dora, do not be angry ...
I know we both said things we did not want to say, but that does not mean that we still do not love each other.
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

You see, Molly, what people do not understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of work.
So where did you study?
Oh, I did not go to college.
No, where did you study acting?
Molly ... people do not study acting ...
Molly, do you want to leave us a minute?
Of course, I'll go see Emma.
Thank you
Will the stable boy never have the princess ??
What do you think you'll do, sleep with her here on my couch?
No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
You know, it's not fair.
What makes you think I'm going to sleep with her, then send her?
Huh?
Can not you open your mind to the possibility that I really love it and that I may want something real?
Look, the truth is I did not feel that way for someone since Rachel, okay?
I did not think I could love again.
Come on! Joe!
Okay
Hi, Molly is here?
Yeah, come in. Molly?
Hey! Guys, it's Tabatha. I will see you tomorrow.
Ok ... Joey, I guess we have no problem.
It's as if my favorite fairy tale is coming true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!

And what's cool is that the character comes from Naples, right?
Yeah.
My whole family is from Naples!
Oh that's great! Okay, I heard everything I needed to hear. I just need to, uh, Leslie
Joey, that's the awkward part.
Oh!
Oh yes!
No problem.
I understand perfectly.
Make sure I do not have terrible tattoos or scars.
Do not worry I have nothing to hide.
So here it is me.
One hundred percent natural!
I tell you, it never happened before.

This room is available.
Okay!
OK wait!
You listen to me!
You listen to me!
Since I'm waiting for four women, it's four, one more than the number of centimeters I'm dilated, have come and gone with their babies!
I am next!
It's my turn!
It's only fair!
And if you bring a woman and she has her baby in front of me, I will sue you!
Not this hospital, I will sue you!
And my husband, he's a lawyer!
Uh Rach
Come back on this darling affair!
I do not think the next patient is very far away.
Ok, so bring her here.
OH MY GOD!!!

Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from this guy and guy. And that one-guy! They are all huge!
They do not look bigger than me!
Well, maybe it's because you're closer to you. So, you seem bigger of where you are.
I'm just going to say hello to the guys. Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Hi.
Whoa! I liked that a bit.
Ok, I know what I have to do. I have to go Red Ross. You know Red Ross!
I do not know what you're talking about.
Come on! The time we all waited online
You know, you gave me a lot more support when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do it, we'll support you like crazy.
Yeah.
We just want you to think about it.
Yes, darling, maybe you can talk to someone who has had a baby. Like your mom?
My mother never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mother did.

Umm, thank you for meeting me.
Thank you. Okay.
Come and sit down.
Sit.
Sit down!
Umm, all right, before we start, I just - I need you to declare for official registration that you're actually Frank Buffay.

Six lucky ....
Everyone is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. It's Monica.
Hi!
And Joey ....
Hi!
And Ross.
Hi!
He does not speak much English.
Look at this!
So, uh ... where does Paolo come from?
Oh ... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight in the building. Suddenly. In our lifes.
Well, the cat ... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
It's funny, and Rachel keeps touching him.
Well. I looked everywhere in the building and I could not find the kitty anywhere.
Oh, I found it. It was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! Here! Last to know again! And I guess ... since no one told me ... it's Paolo.
Ah, Paolo, it's Phoebe.
You betcha!

Okay, where the hell did you get that ?!
When mom and dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose watered, I went swimming in the lake and fished it.
This cup is mine!
No it is not! You want it, you will have to win it!
Okay, so are not we dine at all?
Why?
Because I do not work at the Szechwan dragon.
Okay.
You really, really need to sleep, darling.
I know what I do.
Hi.
Hi.
Guess what?
What?
They published my article.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Rachel, look! Oh hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come save me. Here it is.

Oh my God.
You know what it is, we are preparing for the prom.
Oh.
What?! You kicked us out !!
I told you not to go!
Well, he made Rachel cry!
Rachel is still crying!
This is not true!
Now Joey, you go there and you suck it. I mean you are afraid as you have never feared before!
Okay! I'll try! But if I can not, you can stay with Chandler and me until you are settled.
Go!!
Okay, okay, okay.
I mean, I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with that.

So, he's just a nice guy. Do you really think this brand wants nothing in return for helping?
Well, I guess I'll have to take showers with him, but you know, that's true for any job.
How are you feeling?
Well, my apartment is gone, because I drank it.
Where did you have too? We lost you after opening all the presents.
Yeah.
Yes, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Woooo hoooo !!!
Ow, no "woo-hooing", no "woo-hooing".
Why did it happen?
Oh, I had fun with Joey's sister. Well, it's not the worst.
What is the worst part?
I do not remember which sister.
You see what men do! Do not tell me that men are not nice! It's the men !!

What's wrong?
Nothing!
Well, I had that blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, and then I fainted and uh, I have not been able to get up since.
But uh, I do not think it's serious.
It looks like a hernia. You must go to the doctor!
No way!
"Kay, look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything, it will be because it gets me out of the stomach!
Why do I have to start exercising again?
Cursed 15s!
It's a trifle.
He has all these layers.
First there is a layer of lady's fingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.
[Joey and Ross make funny faces] Then raspberries, lady's fingers, then sautéed beef with onions and peas,
then a little more custard, then bananas, and then I just put whipped cream on it!
It tastes like feet!
I love it.
Are you kidding?

Does anyone else think that David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks you're a fox.
Welcome everyone, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Oh oh! It's new!
Guys, can we please do not look that well.
Hush!
People, has this ever happened to you?
You go to the refrigerator to get a good glass of milk, and these boxes are so difficult to open.
Oh, you said it to Mike. Aw! There must be a better way!
And there is Kevin.
Can we please disable this?
Noo way, Kevin.
A revolutionary new product ensures you will never have to open milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Are you intrigued?
You flingin'-flangin 'right I am!
Remember that he has never used this product before, you will see how easy it is to do.
Go forward.
It works with any carton of milk.
Wow, it's easy. Now, I can have milk every day.

Well, you might want to tell him that his wife is gay.
She is not She is gay. Oh my God. She is
Good day for the bride and groom, huh?
I'm sorry, your husband cheated on you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women are not so good either.
Try saying that to my wife.

Hey Ross, will you give me that knife?
I can not wait to be with you!
I'll sneak in as soon as Ross gets Ben.
I'm just going to tell Rachel that I'm going to do the laundry for a few hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is this my new nickname?
Awww, you know what's your nickname, Mr. Big
Arghh !!

I can not believe I'm going to lose this job!
Oh I'm so sorry dude! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge in front of the security guard.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah?
Well, I do not want to talk to you Wayne!
I hate you!
You ruined my life!
Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
Wayne, Chandler.
Hi how are you?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I-I'll take you back to your job if you help me.
Why should I help you ?!
The reason he just said.
What do you need?
I - I - I - I saw you on stage talking to this beautiful woman, do you know Sarah?
What?
And I too am only a machine for love.
Ross, let me show you where the room is.

Oh, I thought it was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He is just the nicest little man!
A plus Phoebe! Oh and hey, thank you for taking part!
Did you contribute ?!
Yeah, uh, huh, 100 bucks.
Phoebe! I can not believe you gave them money! I thought you had agreed that it was totally unreasonable to have asked for this money!
Yes, but they did not ask me!
You know?
In this way, I'm just, you know, this exotic and generous stranger.
It's always fun to be.
Yes, but you make me look bad!
No I'm not.
No!
If anything, I make you better!
They will see you talk to me and it's - I'm a success!
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh hi Ross.
Uh, see, I thought maybe you could change your apartment because Phoebe is more like us.
Something to think about.
Yeah, all right, my bad.

Okay, okay, okay ...
Right here. I need to borrow moisturizer.
Why?
Whaddya think? Today is the big day!
Oh my God. Ok, go to the bathroom, use what you want, but never tell me what you did in there.
Thank you!
Where is Joey? His mother is on the phone.
He is in the bathroom. I do not think you want to go!
Come on, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...
Who is strong?
Oh, it would be Monica.
Hey, listen, I want to borrow a couple, Aurora has spent the night, I really want to make her breakfast.
Oh, you have all night, huh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes to Ethan, so, you know ...
Ooh, do I feel a little resentment?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.
'Kay?
You know, in a relationship, do you have those key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
Well, every second is like that with Aurora ... and I just lost about 35 to talk to you, so, uh ... Monica, can you help me with the door?
Sure.
Oh, uh, Chandler?
You know, old Monica would like to remind you to scrub this teflon pan with a plastic brush ... But I'm not going to do that.

Hi Monica, it's Joey!
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even if you're a big star!
Aw, come on! It will be years before I forget you!
Joey, how are you doing on a movie set, huh?
Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, yeah, yeah, I have it all.
Yes, listen, I want you to tell Chandler that he could not have been more wrong!
Uh-oh!
I have to go Monica, my sushi is here!
Sorry about that. Thank you for waiting.
Everyone smiles! OK thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay in

Wow, that's so cool, guys. The whole city is blackened!
Mom says that everything is in Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they do not know when it will come back.
Wow, guys, it's big.
Pants and a sweater?
Why mom?
Who will I meet in a power outage?
Electricity companies?
Eligible looters?
Can we talk about it later?
OKAY.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check my grandmother. What is my number?
Well, I never call

What are you doing?
Swim.
What about the girl?
Chicks do not swim.
Are you sure?
I do not know. Should we try it?
Sure.
You see, I told you they do not swim.
Expect. Give him a minute.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.

Take care of yourself is not a problem, huh?
You feel safe.
Right?
Okay, I'm going to take this spit bubble like, "Yeah, yes!"
Ok, after I get rid of that dirty diaper, Leslie, I'll get you a clean one.
OK I am sorry.
I did not want to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.
Okay?
Because let's face it, we're at Monica's.
I broke it.
Okay.
Well, it's just the way it's going.
Okay, good.
Why are there only two of you?
Where is Leslie?
Well, you can not answer.
Leslie?
Where are you Leslie?
Leslie, now would be a

Hey!
Hey.
Hey, why are you sponging your ceiling?
Oh, there is banana on it.
You said she was bald.
Yes, she was bald, she is not now.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
I do not know, I hardly ever talk about that.
Oh, well, it's just perfect!
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Yes, I said what was wrong when I thought it was a strange bald girl. I mean, you know, this girl has hair
Well, maybe it will not work. Maybe Ross will not like his personality.
Why does she have a bad personality?
Oh no, Bonnie is the best!

Hey!
Hey.
Do you have a minute? I would like to talk to you about something that I am, I am really uncomfortable talking.
Sure. What? Do you shower with your mother?
I actually had a topic in mind! I am going through a period of sexual drought.
Whoa, for months?
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, do you like sexually strange things?
No!
Oooh, wrong answer.

Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, hush!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I did not want to make noise!
So do not break in !!
Oh yes, Smokey Joe found himself halfway down the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old child.
So why are you smoking?
Well it's very disturbing.

Honey, I was wondering ....
Hmm?
Do you still have this navy uniform?
Nooo, I had to return it instead of the costume.
Hmm.
I think I have a former high school group uniform.
Do you remember not having sex in high school, right?
Yeah.
Well, darling, what about you?
What?
I mean, do you have fun, you know, fantasy things?
No.
Go on, you must have one!
Ugh!
I do not know Monica.
It's funny to be right here.
I mean, if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, it's like betraying Chandler.
Not at these prices.
Hi. You know, in England, that car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You must feel this bad boy.
Um, Monica, it's so weird, you know, Chandler is your friend ... Oh!
Oh my God!
Oh, okay, take this bed, you can make other friends.

You know, since I was little, I was able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Good for you. Uh, neighborhoods or rolls of neighborhoods?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you off from all my photos. So, if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Its good.
Oh, are you sure?
Really?
Because you know, you can make small puppets and use them in your theater of cruelty.
We can not do that.
What? What can not you do?
She really said that?
Well, I added the part "exactly like me" ...
But she said she was looking for someone and someone would be here tonight.
Tonight tonight?
Well, I think it's perfect.
You know, it'll be just the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey ...
I do not remember the last time a girl took care of my monkey.
Anyway, I thought after work I would go get a bottle of wine, go there and, uh, try to woo her.
Hey, you know what you should do? You should bring it back to the 1890s, when this phrase was last used.

The car is waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop these copies of my book for your friends. Do you want something from Lisbon?
No, just know that you will be there.
Well, well, be good, I love you.
You kissed my best Ross! ... or something to that effect.
Okay. Look, it was stupid.
Really stupid.
Really stupid.
And I do not even know how it happened.
I'm sorry, darling, I promise it will never happen again.
Are you okay now?
Yeah. No no...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Hush He did it. He told her, and not just about the kiss, everything.
You're kidding.
No no. He said, "When are you going to grow up and start being a mother?"

Oh that's it.
These are not your usual dry cleaners.
I know, but this scourge that I went on that date is going on there, so I have to find a new one.
I also need to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
What?!
A new grocery store.
The universe told me that I was going to meet a good guy and that's what they gave me?
When I'm up there, I'll kick ass.
Do not worry Phoebe, you'll meet someone. If I can meet a good guy, you can too.
Yes, we can both. And we will do it both.
Oh, you did not have to come with me.
Are you kidding? This is where they get stained! Okay? It's like
Okay.
Oh excuse me! I think you dropped Wow!
What?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're incredibly beautiful.
Oh yes, I'm sorry for that too, but what are you going to do?
I hope you do not think I'm crazy, but I feel like I have to, do you believe in that kind of thing?
A little. Now you speak.
Do you want to go out and have a cup of coffee?
I-I-I would. Let me just tell my friend.
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get that?
She had to leave.

Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We are in the same team!
Four hours? Have you been doing this for four hours?
That's right baby.
Okay, let me in.
No no! Do not do it! Do not!
What?
It's a dropper!
Oh yes, it's true!
I am not a dropper!
It's really a game for three people, you see?
It's throwing and catching!
Okay.
Oh! Oh! It's so hard.
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Oh my-Oh good God!
I'll let you down, I do not know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Cooking did not help, huh?
Okay, the place was closed. I will just copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rachel, why are not you moving with me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm fine, I mean, I mean Rach, I know I scared you with all Naked Thursday stuff, but we do not have to do it!
Well, it would be easier to get just across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you think of Naked Wednesday's.
Thursday is clearly not good for you, choose a day!

So that's two boxes of holiday macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Admit him simply Chandler, you have no setbacks.
Excuse me, my child, I have a very solid setback.
Protecting your face and screaming like a girl ... is not a setback.
I was screaming ... like a navy.
Everything here. Watch me perform the three 'P's of the championship game. Power. Precision. and penache.

She is not really a person on the phone.
Yeah, so, uh, so, what's up with that father, I mean, if someone had my baby somewhere, I'd like to know, you see?
Hey, Knick fan, do you have any interest in paternity? Uh no.
Ok, maybe I should go there.
Maybe you should.
Good luck and take care of yourself, huh?
You know what's the Celtics problem? They let the players lead the team.
Oh, that's not true.
Oh, that's it.
It's not.
It is.
Is not!

Okay ladies, that ends today's class and, remember, let's be safe.
It's a good class.
Thank you.
Yes, yes, I was watching.
Uh, hey, a few questions though.
Uh, about this last move where the woman tripped you and then stuck you on the ground, what-what-what would you do next?
Well, she would take her keys and try to trap them
No no no. No. What would
Who? Me the attacker?
I'm sorry, Chandler, you know you're such a nice boy and I do not want to hurt you.
Oh, I wish I could do something to make you feel better.
No-no-really ?!
Of course!
Well, it hurts so much. I uh
Oh I am sorry.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
What?! Whatever! Whatever!
Well, uh, I mean, I do not talk about that now, but I have this friend.
That actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing it, but would it be possible for him to audition for your film on Thursday?
Absolutely! But would you really feel better than I reject you if your friend actor can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I will see you later.

Ok, I have that. I'm going to escape there. I will come back here. Okay, come on
Hey guys. Listen, I'm sorry to have misplaced the game before - Oh my God! Your friends have unhappy initials!
They are all Chandler.
Chandler is bad! He could not have had that good!
I did. But that had a price.
But Ben is coming tonight and he can not see that.
Oh come on, at the age of seven, children have already seen orgies. Was it just me ?!

Sure!
Okay, I thought we should have a nice spare room, right?
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on it all the time!
And we could have a desk with comment cards so that people can tell how much they liked to stay here !!
Okay, whatever, I really did not think so much.
I like this idea.
Obviously!
I thought maybe, maybe, maybe it could be a game room, you see?
I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
No.
Ok, you mean no, because "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea, let's discuss it before rejecting it completely."
Oh I am sorry. Of course I think so. Interesting idea, uh, talk about it, but no.
So that's it?
I do not think arcade games go into the beautiful room. The beautiful guest room will be filled with antiques.
That is why
What do you have against the beautiful room?
I have nothing against the beautiful room, especially that everyone knows less than 30 seconds!
Are you making fun of me?
No, I do not make fun of you or your beautiful guest room.

You know, I love doing crosswords with you, darling!
Oh me too. Now, let's finish this and go to bed.
Okay! There is only one word left, three letters, not dog but
Cat.
Yes! You are so clever! I love you.
I love you too.

I never sucked, I did not want you to know how good I was!
Why?
I do not know.
It's awesome! We can now participate in doubles tournaments!
It is

Hey!
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
But
No! No no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended it to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Okay. Okay, but you can not send it back today.
Why not?!
Because I unload it today.
What?! You said he was sweet!
he
Just do not pick up your phone.
Then he comes! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
What? So now, I'm not allowed to fire him?
You can not send him away and throw him away the same day, he will commit suicide.
Okay, I'm going to fire him today and you'll go out with him another week.
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'm going to kill
Okay, so we'll do both today and he'll just have to deal with it!
Okay. But the question is who will go first. Because whoever goes second is the dog.
Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You will see.

This is the last stop of flight 664 to Yemen.
Well, I guess I have to go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I will wait for you. Do you even know how long you will be gone?
Well, until we find a source of energy to replace the fuel.
Oh. Well, I correct you every day. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Okay goodbye. Goodbye.
Chandler?
No!
Chandler!
Janice!
There you are!
There you are!
I had to have one last kiss, and you also said you were going to leave right after my flight!
No! No! I want to see you take off.
Well, I guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we arrive in Yemen, can I stay with you?

Hi!
Hey.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda doing? Does she work?
Oh, my new assistant is working, yes.
Was she happy that you gave her the job?
Oh, my new assistant was very happy to have hired my new assistant.
Hello?
Oh hey!
Can you, can you stick to a second?
These are the producers at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.E.
can you excuse me for a minute?
Hey, funny, you should call.
I was just watching the script next week.
Canceled?!
As if they were removing the air?
Ohh
Okay, to Monday.
We did not even shoot them anymore? !!
Okay goodbye!
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Sorry.
I'm sorry Joey.
Why would they do this? It was a good show, was not it ?!

It's so isolated here.
I know. I like it here.
I feel like we are the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
What is the darling problem? Did you see a little mouse?
No no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would-you-in fact, would you like to check that?
Honey, we do not have bears here.
Well, ok. Would you like to get me a

A lesson on the importance of unagi.
Ohh
Maybe Now, I'm curious to know when from those screams of girl would you have started to
Okay, so we were not
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to defend my point of view, but I'm looking, I just want you to be safe.

What are you doing?
I'm leaning This is where I lean.
Okay. (Go up and stuff the pillows on the couch.
Brenda a bee!
What?
Yes! He flew in your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest he sting you!
I think I know what's going on here.
You do?
Look, I know it must be hard for your wife to be lesbian, but that's wrong. You are married.
I understand perfectly. Can I

Okay, let's do it!
No no no. What was that?
I know, it was the best I could get.
Well, people!
People, people, people.
Let's try again and this time, let's watch everyone watching Joey.
Show them how it's done.
Count the shot.

So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan receive an invitation or not?
Oh, my God, no one likes it, and it's so cheap that it would never fly to London in a million years.
Yes, invite him?
Hey, did I do that pretty well?
Yes, they are fine.
Yeah?
If anyone asks, we'll just say that Ben has spoken to them. Oh! So did you invite Rachel then?
Sure. Why not?
Really?
Yeah?
I do not think I would be comfortable with one of my old lovers there.
Wait, wait, wait, do you think we should not invite him?
Oh, no-no, you absolutely love Rachel, it's just that, well, it could be embarrassing for you.
But that's absolutely your decision.
No more tea?
Yes of course.
Earl Gray?
Huh? Yeah, all right, invite whoever you want.

Hi.
Hey!
Hey! So, how was the doctor?
Oh, everything went well.
Well.
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Oh.
I do not see the baby. Where is it?
Oh no, I know I could not see him either at first, but it's true, um, Ross, I lost again.
Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs it.

Excuse me?
Could you help me with something?
The patient I am looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
And uh, it's from the beginning to the middle of the thirties, very attractive.
I think I know who you are talking about.
Oh yes! Awesome! Ok, what room number is it?
I'm sorry, this information is for hospital staff only
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Dr. Drake who?
Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need this information. I am a doctor.
A doctor in this hospital?
Cursed woman, we are wasting precious time! Now, do you want this man's blood on your head?
Hands.
Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me in which room the man described by my assistant remains.
He's one of my patients, I've been treating him for years!
He is in room 816.
816, thank you!
Thank you.
And what is his name?
No!

Hi!
Hi!
Rachel was just helping me. My head was burned by the sun.
Awww.
Thank you so much.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Ok, I see you in our room.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
I know.
Ok, I have to go.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Well, I-I'm going to break up with Bonnie.
Right here?! Now?!
Well yeah.
I can not - I can not stay here all night, and if I go, she'll - she'll ... do stuff.
What happened?
He will not get there, he's stuck in Chicago.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is so lucky!
Stupid and useless Canadian currency!

Rachel, one of your clients seems to have left his wallet. A Joshua Bergen.
Really?
Do you want to call him?
Yes!
I go!
Absolutely!
(She pulls out her license and her license and holds them face to face.
She then acts as Dark Helmut in

Oh my God! It's so good!
I'm full and yet I know that if I stop eating that, I'll regret it.
Hey!
Hey!
What do you have here?
Oh it's uh, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
What are you doing tonight?
Huh? uh
Guy! Guy!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I have plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had an appointment at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
That's what Monica says.
After she gave me this great speech ?!
She's going to meet a guy the same night she has plans with me?
I think she's trying to shoot a quick on Big Daddy!

Ok, is this lamp in the same place?
We do not care? I repel the women.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no !!! You can not come here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
What?!
It's yours!
Yeah, I'm a slut.
Me too.
Hi Jill!
Hey!
Hi .
Rachel
Rachel! Well, you are not at home, you are here.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Okay. So good, I'll take her home around midnight.

This part was perfect for me! I can not believe I did not get it!
I'm sorry, man.
Hey, you know what you should do?
You should do something for yourself.
You know, like writing a play.
Write a movie!
Huh?
I mean, what about those
Come on Ross, be realistic, see? If I wrote something, what are the chances that I can play these guys?
Wait a second, I could play!
Where.
I can not write!
You know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I do not have the discipline that takes, you see
I can not do it
I will help you.
Yes, I will establish a timetable and make sure you respect it.
And besides, it will give me something to do.

Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do you do?
Oh, especially fashion, so there can be models here from time to time, I hope it's cool.
Yes it's cool. Because I have models here you know ...... never.
Oh, yes, during the summer, I spend most weekends in my sister's beach house, which you can use by the way.
Although I should probably tell you that she is a porn star.
Well, listen, I still have someone to meet, but unless it's your sister, I think your chances are good.
Okay.

As bad as it may be, I really enjoyed myself. I think I'll apologize for all the nonsense I'm doing.
Why do not you just stop doing stupid things? So you would not have to apologize.
I would really love if I could do both.
Okay, I have to ask.
What?
Are you going to break up with me if I get fat again?
What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have won?
One hundred and forty-five pounds.
Yes yes it is. It's always on the lips! Why?! Why on the lips ?!
This is Frannie. Hmm, she will not be happy to see me?
Now, wait a minute, be nice! Okay? I did not bring you here so you could ambush him.
Frannie was the one who found your
This bitch!
Monica! What
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that ?!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
You invite my brother, you invite all my family and not me ?!
Why?!
Why do not you want me at your wedding?
What could I possibly do?
Stuart!
I think you know my husband.
So it's really a question of

Hi girls! What are you here for?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yeah?
It's a crime that you and I do not spend more time together.
What's up?
Well, I heard you were thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe we should have a discussion.
Man to me, me.
Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you crazy? If you live with Phoebe, you will live together!
Yes, I thought about that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.
Hey! Oh listen, I just free up space for your stuff.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was right at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they do not move.
What do you mean, they do not move? They're still moving in, are not they?
No-no, they just had a big rash on what to do with my room.
What?! On a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel pretty bad for them, but I'm also very excited because I do not need to move in here!
Oh no, yes no, this part is great!

Yes
Exclude!!
Where are you guys? Come on, one more game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yeah, get out!
You are still in my apartment!
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
Come on, fools!
Okay, okay, I have to go.
I'm going and I'm gone
One more game?
Oh yes!

I am sorry.
Ohhh, do not leave.
No, I-I-I have to go.
No no! No! No!
Honey, darling, people are searching.
I do not care! I do not care !!
Yeah, I'm, I'm leaving now.
You can not leave! I have your shoe!
Goodbye Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those of Burgendy.

Oh, ew!
What?
Yes, I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?
Because I can and my mother could not, I thought it was something I had received from our father.
What, wait, do you mean like that?
Yeah yeah. You can do it for.
You do not do it.
Oh yes, all right, my mother could, and I can not. We do not have that ...
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any ... Do we have thoughts here?
Well, I've never used the tunnel myself, because if I understand correctly, you're not allowed to cross more than one girl in the car, that's it.
But, it seems to me that it's a bit like anything else, you know, face your fear.
He is afraid of heights, you go to the top of the building!
If you are afraid of bugs, get one.
Right.
In this case, you are afraid to commit yourself, so I tell you that you are going there and that you are the most engaged type of person.
Surprisingly, that makes sense.
You think?
Oh yes. Go ahead guy, jump off the top diver, fix the gun barrel, pee in the wind!
Yes, Joe, I assure you that if I look in the barrel of a gun, I almost piss in all directions.

Hey! Hey!
Hi!
Hi! Look! Our images were developed at Rockefeller Center.
Oh great! Hi Joey, do you want to look at pictures of Mona and my skater?
Oh uh, normally I'd love it too, but I'm overwhelmed right now.
Hey, where are the photos that the pretzel seller took from us together?
Oh yes, probably in the end. Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
I miss the time of the photo ?!
You know she has a Ross face!
Okay. Ok, here is a good one of us.
Wow!
Here is a good one!
Wow, it looks like a holiday card, you see, with the tree in the middle, the skaters and the snow.
You know, every year I say I'm going to send holiday cards and I never do.
Do you want to send this one together?
Together? I like people?
Yes, you know. Happy holidays of Mona and Ross. It will be cute, okay?
Okay.
Oh, I have to get to work. So call me later?
Uh, of course.
Goodbye people.

I mean, I do not even feel like having a girlfriend anymore.
Do you want me to leave my job so that you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Is it about Mark?
Oh my God.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh my God. I can not continue to have the same fight with you, Ross! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Well, you're right.
Let's take a break, let's go, let's take some frozen yoghurt or something
No, a break from us.

Bing! We are all ready for tonight, 8 hours.
Oh, it turns out we can not do it. Monica has to work.
Oh, my ex-wife did not work unless you called for her mother to work. Well. Tomorrow night then.
Oh, well, tomorrow is not good for her either.
Oh? Why not?
This is the semifinal of his botchy ball tournament.
What's going on Bing? Does your wife have a problem with me or something?
Well now, now, you're just talking crazy.
So why can not we all go out together?
Because uh we ... we separated. Monica and I separated. Hold me.
Good God Bing I can not say that I am quite surprised, I saw how she looked at you and there was no love there.
And the way she looked at me, the pure desire.
You know, what could really help me through this difficult time stifles something. Can I choke you?
Bing boy, we'll get you out.
Now here is the plan, take your coat, we go to a strip club.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would be panicked. But damn this bitch.

Look at yourself, sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel ... with Emma's chubby little hands around you.
It's good Emma, ​​you're asleep.
: Get away from the cradle, I have a weapon!
It's good, it's good Rachel, it's me. Put the darling.
What are you doing?
Well, I heard Emma stir, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Oh, oh thanks. Well, now that I'm up, I'm going to the bathroom.
There you are, darling ... It's not over.

Did he call?
No, sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he would call. Why did not he call?
Perhaps it is suggested by very intelligent, strong and successful women.
Sophie, please, come out of my ass. Why did not he call Rachel? Why?
OK OK. Uh, well, maybe he, maybe he feels uncomfortable because you're my boss.
Embarrassing? Why should he feel clumsy?
Well...
The only person who should feel embarrassed is you and you did not tell him not to call me, did you?
No I...
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend with someone you work for, there is always a way to fix that ... that.

And you're angry because you did not make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I ask is just a little emotion!
Is it too much to ask after six years ?!
I mean what?
Are you-Rachel and I not as close as you guys ?!
I mean, do not we have fun so much ?!
Do not I deserve some tears? !!
I mean, we ... we said to Joey, he cried his eyes!
Hey!
I did not cry my eyes !!
Come on!
It's like the end of an era!
No more than J-man and Channie!
!
Ok, I have to ask, who's calling us that ?!

Do I know why we are rushing?
Yeah, you know ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
Well, it turns out she wants to come back with me.
Oh, I found it!
!
It's great for you!
Yeah!
Good luck with your girlfriend.
Oh thank you. Eh eh. Rachel !!!!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Yeah, oh hey, you're on time.
So, what are you saying? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, you can do a lot.
Ahhhh !!

Ooh! I am sorry! I think I think that may have missed the table!
Make
Ah,
Make
Ah,
DO YOU?
You know, I do not understand why they did not cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Oh, come on.
Hey!
All you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we learned a lot from mom and dad!
And that image of Chi-Chi with his mischievous smile.
And what you said about Nana.
Ohh, yes, she really wanted to be here.
And you know what?
I think she was.
Oh God, Ross! How do you do that?

You forget how many great Heart songs had.
Yeah.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So you heard it, you repeated it, so it means you wrote it.
Oh, guys, with that joke. I must say, I know I've cracked, but I'm not even sure I have it.
What, did not you have it? The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can not write prescriptions.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think "Hef" would disagree, that's why he sent me a hundred dollar check ah

I can not find garbage bags!
Oh, I think I saw it here.
What is it?!
I do not know! But maybe if we keep this drawer closed, he'll die.
I can not believe we live here!

You still have not told Rachel that you are not really proposing?
No! She had the ring, she seemed so excited, then she pulled her chest.
Joey, you have to tell him what's going on! And what was it like ?!
I did not look at it. The stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Go tell Rachel before Ross discovers it.
Look, it's not so easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I do not want to hurt her.
Ok, look, do it gently.
You are right.
You are right.
I'll tell him now before Ross discovers it and I'll be sweet.
I can do it.
I am a sweet person.
Oh, by the way.
Two people kissing if you want to check that.

Hi Pheebs?
Ok, so just talk to the nurse and the reason your doctor is late is because, uh, she's not coming.
What?!
Ok, uh, it's that tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and uh, it's like those really scary manners in England.
Which
How would you describe the theme of this book, see here, Rachel Green?
Uh, well I must say it's a tragic love story.
Well, it's kind of given, but yes. Someone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, la-la uh, the savageness of morals, which
Excellent! What Rachel cleverly observed here
You completely stole my answer!
Well, honey, that was pretty obvious.
Well, how would you know ?! You did not even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
I think your question is a question with a lot of answers.
Would you like to venture one?
Would have
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Are you repeating what are you
All right, let's move on.
OK then.

Alright, all right, that's great, uh, Chandler, you're behind the desk.
And - and when she arrives with hope, she will not recognize you because, why would she?
Uh, all right, and then you buzz Ross and me.
You are Mr. Gonzalez, and I will be uh, Mr. Wong.
Diverse.
Did someone call for security?
Be cool.
Ok, which of you is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Where is my ring? The wedding ring of my dead grandmother? Where is it? Where is it?
Way to be cool, man.
What is he talking about?
There was a ring, in a box, on my bedside table, after you left, she was gone!
Wait, do you think I stole a ring?
We know you've taken so just-just save time and confess!
Ok, who are you?
Hardy boys?
Look, I do not need to steal a stupid ring, okay?
I earn $ 1,600 a week doing what I do; one of you doing that?
Marry me.

Oh my God! Joey!
Hell yeah! I'm going to marry you!
You can not marry him!
Hey ma'am, your day is over! It's my turn!
Phoebe!
Why?! Why can not she marry me ?!
I can and I want!
She's not pregnant It's Rachel. Rachel is the one who is pregnant.
Oh my God.
Hey!
Phoebe I think he would realize if you did not have a baby in nine months!
It's Joey!
Now I can not believe it! What? Rachel is pregnant? Who is the father?
We do not know
Ohh I wonder if this guy.
Is there a guy?
Yeah.
Who? Who is it?
About a month ago, this guy spent the night with Rachel, I did not see who it was, but
Was this story over?
The guy left that.
Oh my God! I know who the father is
People have to finish their stories!

Oh my God, you're back!
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I want to see what's in the hand. I want to see the trash.
Yeah.
Eww! Oh, everything is dirty. You should throw this away.
No!
Me too!
Hey, when the music started again, maybe I thought about going into the robot, you know?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we do not want to look stupid!
Good we are back! We have ten seconds left! Ten! New! Eight! Seven!
Three two one!
Cut!
No! Year! Happy new year no!
Ok, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, good job everyone's a wrap!

So Lizzie, are you planning on staying the night?
Oh no-no, believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Well. Well. Not that we do not want you to stay, obviously, you're welcome. How much more homework do you have?
I see. You know, Phoebe makes rabbits in socks.
No!
No, she does not.
Uh Phoebe, what she's doing is ... these are rabbit socks.
They are completely different, okay!
Okay!
Okay!
I did not do it!
I am sorry!
I totally forgot tonight and the fact that we are supposed
Oh that's good. I do not
No, no, that's wrong!
It's not!
I mean you were right You're so amazing!
You spent all this time and all these efforts to make this tape for me!
You know I'm just going ... I'm going to invent that for you!
I go!
I go
Well, I thought a lot about the band.

No. Then I called him and he was not there.
Well, then he's probably out.
Oh, thank you very much, I'm glad you came.
Hello.
Hi! It's me.
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Really? I thought, it's crazy, I mean, do not you think we can work on it?
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Who is it?
Nobody.
Can I finish the apple juice?
Is it Mark?
Uh, darling, look, he just ...
Yeah! I got it!
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come Dance.
Oh ok, thank you.
Hey, you do not have to smile. You just have to dance.
Listen, I do not want to dance, I want to have a drink. Okay?
Oh ok. Hey, two beers.

Do you want to go to the room? It's a little more comfortable.
Sure.
Okay. Oh, wait! Umm, did you send these contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of ​​sexy conversation?
No seriously, you know the contracts I gave you, did you spend the night?
Which contracts?
Ok please, tell me it's just one of your jokes that you do that I do not understand.
Like that?
You know, like when you put the phone in your pants?
Label!
I'm serious!
It's not funny!
These contracts were absolutely to be concluded today!
Rach, I'm sorry, but you did not give me a contract!
Yes I did it! And I put a little
I tell you, you never gave them to me.
You know what, if we went down to the office, you'd see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I'd see you embarrassed because they're
Or maybe you'd be embarrassed because you're talking on the phone with your crotch!
Do you want to go to the office right now?
No! Come late, we're not going to the office.
OK I understand. I would not be wrong either.
Ok, go get your coat! Oh! When did you get that? Good work!

Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, and I need to talk to you.
On what?
To see if you know what these guys are talking about.

Pheebs, how are you?
I'm fine. I think it's okay. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking too fast?
No, sounds like me. Pheebs, that's fine. Look at Chandler with little girl Chandler.
Little girl Chandler, where did I hear that before?
Oh yes, Coach Ruben.
Do you know what Pheebs?
When you're done there, we have a little situation here too.
No, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
See where I think you are wrong. We played these babies man for man; we should really play a zone defense.
What do you mean?
Forgive me? You have not taken my calls for a week!
Well, I'm totally out of Chandler. Friends forever! Do not come here!
Uh, what was that?
uh

... I'm fine.
It sounds good. I'll call you or you'll call me, whatever ...
Okay.
Goodbye.
Whoo Hoo!
Yes that's it!
Second appointment!
...I do not know.
You
Well, she looks very nice and all, but all that for her to come here, just to see if it's okay?
I mean ... how much is it necessary?

Do you remember when a child and your mother would drop you in the movies with a jar of jam and a teaspoon?
You are so cute.
Hi!
Hi Phoebe.
Hey, oh, do you know this guy following me? I spoke to him today.
You spoke to him. Are you insane?

Thank you, happy holidays.
Now, they are garbage. Girl, you can not Hey! Stop this young lady, she gave garbage!
Hey !!
Charity is on fire!
Help me!
Oh good!
Thank you, I need that.
Whoa!
What is it?!
It is nine o'clock in the morning!

Can I help you?
Uh yeah, where's the guy who decides who's going to put the pictures on the wall?
He is not here yet.
Oh, you do not care about me!
All right, make sure to tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped to drop all those clothes.
Okay?
I am an actor; I'm a little bit having my picture up on the wall.
You know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I are going to have a drink? Are you the other no?

Yes, and it really scared me! And after a while, I even tried to hurt you and it pushed you forward.
What?! You are crazy! The noises I make are not sexual!
Really?
There is nothing sexual about it?
Oooh.
Oo God!
Ohh
Ohhhh.
Ohh
What are you looking at?!
I mean hello.
Oh my-it's so embarrassing. Oh my God, I will never be massaged again!
No, you can not let this stop you from getting massages!
No look, I have a lot of customers who make the same noises as you!
Really?!
Not the customers, the lovers. But let's just try again. Come back and-and we'll work through.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I suppose.
Awesome! Ok, if you'll excuse me. So, did you hear something that you liked?

Noo !!!
Yes!
Noo !!
Yes!!
Oh no! My parents never saw me drunk! That they know.
Ok, here's the thing. We will get you coffee and they will never know that you are intoxicated.
Really?! You promise?
Yes, I'll take care of it.
Okay. I love you so much.
Okay, we have to do something about your breath.
What about
It's always up to you. Ok, now remember that this is a surprise party. So when you come in, act surprised.
Okay. I can do it.
Okay.
Surprise!!!

Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
Yes, we are done.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to see this new Imax movie about tide pools?
Really?!
No, but I have Knicks tickets for you, me and Chandler.
Sugar!
Very good, finish your coffee; Let's go.
Oh no no, not only Ross. Ross and Joey are pretty embarrassing.
In fact, sorry, I can not even get there. I see Mona tonight.
I understand: who would cancel a real date to go to a party between fake boys?
I'm sorry I have to cancel tonight baby

So it's Nancy that I know you like this one and that I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Well, uh, that one is pretty but uh, I'm coming, I love this fabric, sorry.
Oh, do not be sorry, it's part of your job here to give your opinions and I give them credit - I'm kidding.
She laughs, but never disapprove. Ok, now I'm laughing!
Oh, what a fun office.
I do not know which one, but I know I need a cigarette.
So, what are you saying, we take a break, we go out, and we'll know it when we get back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my father is a doctor and he always told me horror stories about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.

What?
Fishing core.
Yes, rabbit?
Fishing core. That night, we had ...
-Peaches?
In fact, nectarines, but basically ...
It could have been a fishery.
Then we dressed and I-I ... I accompanied her to the bus stop ... it's okay.
Hey, this woman's ass is like Carol's! What? I thought we were trying to find stuff.

Okay!
Westminster Abbey!
Without question, the best abbey I have ever seen.
Hey!
Okay.
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
I think it's great. It's good. You know, they are considering changing the name of this place.
Really? What?
To put away the camera !!!
Man,
You know, I can not believe my nails are cooked! And
Chandler, there's a guy right there.
It's a factor! It is
Chandler, do not worry! That does not make you less of a guy!
Hey, do you know who used to have nails like that?
Hmm.

Eh ... I do not know.
What?
Well, as old as his age, do not you think that Snoopy should always have the right to fly with this thing?
Rachel?
Yeah.
Do you remember when you got here, how did you spend two weeks being trained by another waitress?
Oh, of course! Do you need me to train someone new?
Good one. In fact, Terry wants you to resume training at any time.
Hey, do you think that?
Yeah?

Hey darling, you have the kind with the little girl, you said we were going to have the kind with the baby.
No, you said that the baby scares you.
No, the little girl scares me.
You said the baby.
Why would the baby kiss me?
Why would the little girl help you?
Sorry, could you speak a little more slowly, please?
This goes in your book?
Yes, it's about relationships. You know? The traps, the traps, what not to do, continues. This thing is great!
What?! Excuse me!
And how much nothing anytime people really like each other.
And how people will believe everything you tell them as it's a compliment.

Yeah!!!!
Yes I did it!
I'm on time!
Ok, why not open all our books on page 23.
Where where you will see a pile of red spots.
Okay, why not, why do not you all start reading, while I-

Yeah, okay. Okay! Keep walking! Okay?
Ross! What are you? I'm sorry sir. I just think he really likes you a lot.
Hey! Do you know this teacher who had a baby with his pupil?
What is What
Hi!
Miss? Can I help you?
Ok, listen, do not ... do not be angry, okay?
But after unpacking the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you, so I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything and then I forgot where, where he went back and I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not.
I mean, my God, Chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
I know I have this strange thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I would never expect you to worry about it.
Really?
Of course!
Oh, you are the best. You come here for me.
Okay, wait, okay? The first thing is the first. Ok, now Ross has sat down

Ok, that's all. I can not make that decision! It is
A Magic Eight balloon ?! You can not be serious, you can not make that decision with a toy!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I do not know what else to do.
I mean, either I keep my wife and lose one of my best friends, or I keep my friend and I divorce a second time before I turn 30!
So, if anyone has a better suggestion, let's listen to it!
Because I - I have nothing!
Okay, do not be shy, any suggestion will do.
OK then.
Here we go.
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
Ask again later.
Later is not good enough.
Ask again later.
What is going on!
It's broken!
It's broken!
Okay, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Do not count on it. Looks like it works for me.

Excuse me.
Yeah?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Yeah.
Can I get your autograph, I am your biggest fan.

I think she took it very well. You know Paolo is there right now, so ...
Ah ... ooh! Well, it looks like, uh, you've been kicked in the buttocks.
No, no, she kicked us. You could be part of the Olympic team standing up.
Come on, two against one.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to dive!
And now?
Yes, it is now that you go for it!
You have to make sure that when Paolo comes out of there, the first guy Rachel will see is you, she will have to know that you are all that he is not
You are like anti-Paolo!
My Catholic friend is right.
She is helpless.
You are here for her.
You take the pieces, and then you inaugurate the age of Ross!

Well, I just called Joshua
Oh, how did it go?
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not a crazy girl who is dying to get married - I'm going through a difficult time.
What did he say?
Well, his answering machine was
Oh, darling! Hey, I bet all he will call you back.
Yeah, maybe, but I do not even think about it.
I do not think he's the only one I'm sad for.
You know, I know I said I totally agree with Ross's wedding, but I happen to think that I do not think I'm using it that well.
Yeah maybe.
And I'm just trying to understand why.
A little bit of luck?
Well, yes, do you know how Ross and I were still on again, again and again?
I guess I just thought that somewhere on the road we would be again.
Again. You know what? I think we all did.
Hey!
I do not understand!
It was in my room all night!
And if she did not take it, and I did not take it; and you did not take it, so who did it?
Hush!
We try to think!

This is the unit for you my friend. Robust construction, tons of storage compartments, some of them big enough for an adult man.
What?!
Oh yes!
I arrived myself once.
My roommate bet me five dollars that I could not, then he stuck a board between the handles that locked me
Yeah.
It was funny until I started to feel like I was in a coffin.
No, you can not integrate with this thing. It's not deep enough.
Oh yes? If I can not, I will reduce the price of the unit by five dollars.
Okay, you have an agreement yourself.
Okay. See?! I told you!
Sometimes I come here just to get away! Hey, a nickel !!

Hey! What's up?
Hey!
Hey hey, who's your friend? Hey !!
Hey Joey!
Erin! Still there!
Yes, we ended up spending the day together and we had fun!
Why not you? Erin is great! So, there are you guys.
Ohh, listen. I have to go. Today was great, thank you!

I think I brought half of the beach back into my hair. It was so much easier when I shaved my head.
You know, I have to tell you that I'm coming
Really?!
Ohh!
Because I think of shaving everything from time to time.
Really?!
Yeah!
I mean you really should do that.
You know what, I should do it.
Yeah!
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you're so cool.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave your head!
Okay.

Oh Monica. You are not going to talk about it yet.
This woman lives my life.
What?
She lives my life and she does it better than me!
Look at this, look.
She buys tickets for coins I want to see.
She buys clothes from stores that intimidate sellers.
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You are not an artist.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all that. Only I do not do it.
I can not believe you would say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
No way! Mr. Salty is a sailor, okay, he must be, like, the smallest snack there is.
I do not know, you do not want to play with corn nuts. They are crazazy.
Oh my God. Guys! You have to come and see that! There is a little creep there with a telescope!
I can not believe! He looks at us right!
Oh, it's so sick.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
How can people do that? ... Oh, guys, look! The naughty naked guy has gravity boots!

It was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we have thrown this ball?
Yeah, it's amazing, it lasted so long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper here.
You know, how did I get that reputation as a dropper? Okay? I am

Hey Rach, can you give me the
Yes!
Go!!
What?!! Stop that! Stop that! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We will see you in 3 to 4 hours.
Oh!

Hey!
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Monica tells me that you do not want to play anymore because of me and my talent.
Is it true?
Well, a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.
pheebs
Ah, oh my God. Oh, honey, oh it's okay.
What. Oh no, you just rolled on the juice box.

Hey.
I have just seen a woman breastfeeding her two twins at the same time; it's like a monster here.
What's the problem?
Nothing.
What is it? Hey!
Really it's nothing. I am fair
Rach come, what?
I just thought about how my baby and I are going to be alone.
What are you talking about alone? And for Ross?
Oh please, he will be with his real family, twins and miss new breasts.
Ok, how long have I been watching this woman?
I'm just saying that you know, one day, Ross will meet someone and have his own life. Right?
Yes, I guess so.
I never thought of raising this baby alone. Pretty stupid huh?
Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What are you doing?!
I just discovered that it's Chandler's office! Go Toby, give me a hand!

Chandler, we said we would meet at the cafe at six o'clock.
We said seven!
We said six!
The only way I said six would be if the seven, meet at seven, not six.
Yes, and if I had seven, I might have said something like, "Wow, my boyfriend is such a wise teenager!
Hi!
Oh my goodness
Ugh!
I know what time you said.
What?!
In fact, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Get out of my shop!
Well, what did he do?
He went out with my wife!
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did
This is my wife !!! Get out!
Well, we should go there.
Yeah.

You know, you really did not have to take me to the airport.
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.
You know?
In addition, someone had to take the rest of your luggage in this other taxi and your friends do not seem to care too much about your departure.
Well, we're really not that close. Ok, so I guess it's a goodbye then.
On no! No! It's not goodbye, I will not leave until you take this plane.
No, I'm afraid I can not make love as well as him.
Yes, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the real words.
So, Joey had a lot of girlfriends, that does not mean he's good in bed.
We share a wall! So either he's good in bed, or she just likes to agree with him.
Honey, with you it's going to be different. Sex is going to be great, because you are in love.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Go ahead, Chandler.
Yeah, you should.
Yeah, you really should.
Keep on going.
Okay, alright, I'm going to sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.

: I'm sure in the hell of a dancer, it's not worth Marge never defend me.
Go Treeger, do not say that.
You just need more practice.
Come on, come on, let's try again.
Come on.
Besides, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
I mean, you know, I'm not really comfortable dancing with a- We do!
Hey!
: Yeah!

Oh me
Are you sure? I bet there is another flight to Minsk as
July. Umm,
It is really nice. What does it mean?
Please, clean my cups. I do not leave the lab much.
Its good. I must admit that I thought it was something else.
Yeah, I really meant that, but I thought I probably should not, because I have to leave.
You are right! You are right. Do not say it.
I-I do however.
Me too.
Goodbye Phoebe.
Ok, this is not the moment Joey. Okay? You can shout at me tomorrow.
I know.
Oh-oh, wait, did you hear that?
Look, I'm going to get something from your grandmother, she said that since you're keeping the one-bedroom apartment, you should give Rachel the purple chair?
No, I do not hear that.

Yes, I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh that's great!
Yeah! Yeah!
I can not believe you're getting married!
Yeah.
Monica and Rachel are out.

Ohhh!
Why are we in bed together?
I do not know. Do you have clothes?
Yeah.
Really?!
No!
But we did not have sex, right?
I mean, I do not remember much of last night, it was so vague.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
And we did not have sex.
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we did not do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.

What are we going to do?
I say we're going with
Chandler?
Has she ever seen us? Did she see us?
Janice, what are you doing here?
What is this smell?
I know!

Hi, do you remember us?
Um okay. A few moments ago, you just called to request a signature on the admission form. Well, it turns out we need a
I am. I am
Yes, and I will pay for it with a check.
Yeah, I know ... I'm not that brilliant either.

Hey, Monday, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which of these two do you want to wear?
You know what? he
Sorry.
I am so excited!
I've been waiting for months!
I have colored hair!
I have new leaves!
I make him a
Um-hmm.
What do I do to him?
Well, you make him a curly salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild walnuts, wild rice, grilled asparagus and crusted salmon.
I thought I was filleting him?
Yes, you did, but you decided to make salmon because you had left in the restaurant.
And then you realized that if you did not care, you would stop cooking and you had to prepare your famous baked potato and your Coca-Cola.
Wow, I get really sad when I cook.

Chandler! This happens to a lot of guys! You probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, do not worry about that!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated.
You know, it's like, uh, biology!
Which is funny because in high school I failed in biology and tonight biology failed me.
Check it out. Okay, I can play that when the guests arrive. Okay.
Phoebe!
If you'd let me finish, we'll say he's probably not gay.

You fall deeply asleep.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
You are now completely asleep.
You do not need to smoke.
Cigarettes do not control you.
You are a strong and confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
A strong and confident woman.
Thank you for your patience, you are the next interlocutor.
Yes!! Yes!! I am the next caller! You were going to hang me up.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a girl at the theater?
Of course not.
No.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from someone else.

So, how's it going with Paul?
Well.
Although you know, he's a private man.
You know, I wish I could convince him to open up a little, to share feelings.
It's easy! You must just think of him as a jar of pickles that does not open.
So, what are you saying; Should I run it under hot water and bang my head against a table?
No, that's what you do when you want to get someone's truth.
Hello Darling.
Hi!

Ok, Ben, I will not tell your father that you ate ice cream for dinner, if you do not talk about our little bonk incident.
Monica, number one, I do not think Ben understands the concept of corruption, and number two, I ... What ?!
You said number two.
I also said number one.
Remind me to check with you which pot is decaffeinated and which is regular.
I can not just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
Ok, okay.
Gunther, what do you know? I am a terrible waitress. Do you know why I am a terrible waitress?
Because I do not care.
I do not care.
I do not care what pot is regular and which pot is decaffeinated, no matter where the tray is, I do not care, it's not what I want to do.
So, I do not think I should do it anymore.
I will give you my weeks notice.
What?!
Gunther, I stopped.
Does this mean that we will have to start paying for coffee?

Oh, I mean it's so realistic!
I know. Yes, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I understood!!
Are you ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably should not, so I'll do it! Oh! Wow! It's like raining!
Pretty cool, huh?
But if you think you can put a fish on it and it will not be sucked in by the mechanism, you would be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right here.
Okay. My God, if someone told me a week ago that I would pee in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
Yes, life is beautiful, is not it?
Yes it's sure!

You know, I think I was sixteen.
Please, just a little bit in the back.
I am always on "no".
Uh, in the morning. Do you think you could close your eyes for a second?
No-no-no-no-no, I did not fall for that yet.
What is going on?
Well, I sort of did a stupid thing last night.
What stupidity did you make?
Ewww!

I know.
See, yes.
It's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick.
I love you both.
But in very different ways.
Hey!
Hey!
(sees that he looks
I did! But the store would not take it back! So I took her to the shelter and you know what I discovered?
If they can not find her a house, they kill her! And I will not let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay, well, well, well, because, well, because I had a little bit of doubt too.
Okay. And it's not just chicks you know? It's all kinds of other animals!
It's horrible! Well, you made the right choice, man.
Thank you, I'm glad you see it like that.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!

So Chandler, did you hear about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Well yes. She uh, she, uh, she might have talked about him.
So Monday, when are we going to meet this new secret server?
Ohh, he's really shy. I do not think he's ready to meet everyone.
Yes, I do not think he's ready to meet everyone.
I do not care! I want to meet this guy who is the best sex she has ever had!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
I may have said that. Why is it funny?
Because I am very happy for him! And
Hi!
Okay, well, I just can not think about it right now. I just want to say goodbye to my grandmother.
Okay.
Okay, let's say goodbye.

Hey!
Did you have all these things for Joey to try to get me out of the apartment?
Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well make him a fish, you know how much the fish made me flipper!
Fish!
In any case, it would not matter, Phoebe, you and I are going to live together, we are roommates; it's the deal.
Yes, but I wanted you to live with me, but okay, if you're having such fun here
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
We had a lot of fun, did not we?
We were doing!
Oh, anyway, they say, if you want, we can see it tonight.
Oh, I'd like to
Yes OK!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Great, all right, all right, and Monica asks me to stop the drums.
Uh ... Done!

You do not pay for pizza!
Oh come on, that's right, you paid for the theft. Now, is it enough?
Ahh, I'll throw a thousand more on it.
Why, how much?
It's about 60 cents.
Ok, it's coffee.
Iced coffee? Tell me it's iced coffee!
It's hot
Hot coffee!!!
You idiot !!
You were going to pour hot coffee on me, huh? !!
What are you just a big idiot, idiot, idiot, with a silly hairstyle, huh?
Huh?
!
What is your favorite thing in the summer?
Umm, go to the beach. When it is very late day.
Yeah
Hey!
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favorite thing in the summer?
Ooh, I do not know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Ohh, it's a good one.

OK, try this salmon mousse.
Mmmm. Well.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It's creamier.
Yeah
I do not know. We are talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy to keep it, see?
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests ... and what do I learn?
"You are perfectly suited to a career in data processing for a large multinational."
It's so fantastic! Because you already know how to do that!
Can you believe it? I mean, do not I look like someone who should be doing something really
Oh Chandler, I know, I know ... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
That's it, maybe it'll cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better share that with you.

I thought it was going to be a closed coffin.
That does not mean she can not look pretty!
Honey, do you think you can go?
I do not see why not.
Here is my mandate!

Someone there?
No, it's just part of a daring game that I play called 'Wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Jeez, man you fell .. Hi! So, uh, did you fall high?
Someone was in the woman's room, I could not wait. I left the lid for you though.
You know what Gunther, go ahead ah, go ahead, I-I'm talking to ah ,. This is the part where you say your name.
Ginger.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so ...
You do not have to use the bathroom?
No, no, I'd just like, I'd rather talk to you.
Yes.
Yes, I have to go to the bathroom.
Someone here.

I will continue to go to his mother, and you can not do anything about it!
Oh yes there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles ?!
It was an accident! And you too.
At least I'm not a murderer!
Oh my baby!
It was a great scene! And-and-this slap looks so real! How are you doing that?
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I have ice cream here ?!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how great I think you are.
You are not the fan who dies, are you?
Can you repeat that please?
I am supposed to meet and kiss a fan who is dying, but it is supposed to be that later!
No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in a coma!
Oh, was she a real person ?!
Anyway, I ... I just wanted to say that since I have your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there are any tips you can give me.
I-I-I leave the series?
I do not know. Why? Did you hear anything?
Who told you that?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Which? Was he bald or was he tall?
Umm

To feel better?
Yeah!
A lot!
Listen, not that I'm uncomfortable with my manhood or anything else, but I think I need to meet a woman like now.
Yes I understand.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Hi!
You know, you look familiar. Have I ever seen you somewhere?
I do not think so.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on TV. I'm an actor
Wow!
Yeah.
Really?!
Hm-mmm.
$ 4.50 please.
Oh, let me understand that. These are for you.

Okay, okay, okay.
It's been fourteen minutes and a half and you still have not said a word.
Oh my God, do something.
Just make contact, smile!
Here!
You're really scared here.
Do you want to call someone?
Yes, about 300 guys with whom I went to high school.

Okay! Do not hesitate to look, but I tell you that these contracts are not on this desk.
Oh
It's my sister.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway you know what, the
So, when do you imagine that you gave them to me? The morning or afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a

Phoebe, she does not know you sneak out every night, she does not know you sneak in every morning and she does not know you live with your grandmother for a week now.
Ok, maybe not at these levels.
Hey.
Hey.
I will never find a roommate, ever.
Why, nobody good?
Well, let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, it's plural.
The spitter.
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy who liked my name so much that he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
Delighted, Chandler Bing
So how much do you have tomorrow?
Two.
This photographer, who seemed really dull.
And this type of actor, of which I am not sure, because when he called and I answered the phone "Chandler Bing", he said "Whoa-whoa, short message".
Ross, one foot on the ground or do not come anymore!
Of course, your dresser is gone but she notices it.
What?
I have to go. Yes, Carol should be home now, so ...
Uh, how are you guys doing?
Oh, better, actually. You know, I-I-I think I finally understood why we had so many problems lately.
Oh really?
Yeah, you know how I got you, well, she does not really have any close friends who are only hers, but last week she met this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they got really well done it's going to make a difference

Hey!
Hi!
What is it, what is it?
Oh, just a few pictures I made and hung up. I thought they would brighten up the place. They do not you think?
No no no no!
How's it going?
It's like that.
It's crazy.
It may be crazy in a perfect world, a world without blouses, but not in a perfect world, but in a museum now.
Seeing this scientist in class, he and I used to play together all the time in elementary school, but now Peter!
Hey, Peter!
It's me Rhonda!
PS-129!
I shared my puddin 'that you dude!
I gave you my
I-I think everyone pretends not to hear you.
Be that as it may, I do not know about you, your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends. If I keep him a place, I tell you, he
It's good, I'm cool here. I'll catch you later, Joey.
Op, it's saved. Souvenir shop.

How is this coffee?
Yes, right now Mr. Kaplan.
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me disgusting.
I know!
I bet you think, "What is a smart girl who wants to be fashionable, who makes coffee?" Huh?
Op.
Eh.
Oh, you got me.
Well, do not think I did not notice your potential.
Well, I have a project for you that is much more fashionable.
How does it sound?
Oh, that sounds good.
Come here, darling.
Oh thank you very much, Mr. Kaplan, thank you very much.
Well, I know, I was just, uh, I was just thinking and hoping that, uh, maybe you'd like to get back together?
No, but thank you.
Oh, come Phoebe, do not you think?
Okay. No, but thank you.
Ok, to more Pheebs.
Wow, it was a bit brutal.
Okay, let this be a lesson for all of you, okay.
Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, you know.
Very cold, hard, inflexible, you know nothing,
Yes of course.

Sensational.
I am really sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry too. But I must tell you that I am a little relieved.
Relieved?
Yeah, well, I had a good time with you ... I can not stand your friends.

She wants
Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
Well!
Well!
But this breakup is not entirely my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility ..." Full responsibility!
'... I can start trusting you again.
Does this seem to be something you can do?
Does he do it?
! '
No?
Listen, Ross, you got what you want, you're back with Rachel.
If you talk about it now, you will destroy the best thing that has happened to you.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, no, you're right.
Yes I guess I will give up.
But do you understand how difficult it is to forget that.
Of course, it's hard to forget!
But that does not mean you have to talk about it!
During this trip, many things happened that we should never, ever speak.
What happened on this beach ?!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!

I did not think you were gay. I'm doing it now.
See my friend, my friend Rachel, she wants to be installed.
Ah, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for anything serious.
Oh, you know what, it could go even if it was just an adventure, it could go for Rachel.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is it, Rachel hot, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, that's his full name.
Oh wow! I am free for her!
Oh, wait a second! I did not say that I was not free!
Hey, Chandler, why do not we talk to the Rangers game tomorrow?
Wait, you know I
Oh well, it's a little later than me, I usually want to stay, but of course!
Maybe before the match, we could enjoy eight-year-old Basel Hadens, eight years old.
Well, I do not really know what it is, but

Monica, let's go. Go now people, woman in work.
Hey Ross, look what I have to do here.
Yes, keep that for the taxi, okay.
What are you doing? We go to the hospital.
What, then I can not be nice? There could be doctors there.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
Alright Alright.
What is it?
For the journey.
Yes, like in a taxi ...
Save it.
Ok, I hate that.
Monica, come now. Come on, baby coming.
I can not believe it, I'm going to be an aunt. I will have as a nephew.
It's good. Go out, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm going there. I go.
We go, we go
Rossy, Rossy.

WHAT IS IT?!
Ok, I-I know, do you come-you have a quality.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a good quality, because I was afraid you'd be vague about it.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh my God! Call from Rome!
So he calls from Rome. I could do that. I just have to go to Rome.
Monica, your father just beeped, but can you hurry? Speak to Rome I speak in Rome.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh my God. Ross, it's Nana.

So, uh, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Oh, all right, I need a divorce.
Oh yes, of course. We live in the building near the sidewalk.
You know?
Hey, listen, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we get together for a drink?
Oh, of course, they love us there.
Ben! Ben! Ben!

Give me!
No! They are mine!
You stole them!
You stole them from me !!
Give me!
You just want to take one?
Yes, that seems right. We never use them.
Listen, I really need help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak with a British accent ?! What do I do?
well
Why do not you eliminate it?
Yeah, dim the accent and people will think that you are adapting to life in America.
Yeah, I mean, come on, Ross, nobody will even notice it. I mean they probably do not even listen!
They do not listen to me too much?
Of course, they listen to you! Everyone is listening to you.
Monica, do you really think I should try this solution?
I think you look good.

Why not Joey ... Pepponi?
No, always too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a more neutral name.
Joey ... Switzerland?
Besides, you know, I think it should be Joe.
You know, Joey gives me the impression that I am, I do not know, that fat man.
What I am not.
Joe ... Joe ... Joe ... Stalin?
Stalin ... Stalin ... Do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Well, it does not tell me anything.
Joe Stalin. You know, that's fine.
I might want to try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin. I think you will remember!
Oh yes! Goodbye Birdie, with Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the fiddler on the roof.

Are you kidding?
Ok, look.
I studied evolution.
Remember, evolution?
Monkey in the man?
Besides, I'm a doctor and I had a monkey.
I am a monkey doctor!
I do not argue with that.
Okay, I've heard enough. I took my decision.
You are both idiots.
The joke is not funny, and it shocks women, doctors and monkeys!
You should not argue over who has a credit, but who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke on the world!
Now give up!
The joke fears!
It's your joke.
Is not.

Hi everyone, Rachel was so good today. She did not chat at all.
I do not have!
Even when I discovered it, all right, let's say I found something about someone and just say she's going to keep it.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ooh, you nailed the old lady!
Yeah listen so I thought I was getting better, so when I got home today, I stopped at
Do you have, do you have
No.
Give me your hands. Cordes. Give me! To choose. Do you want to learn how to play the guitar?
Yes!
So do not touch one !!
Really? Would you do that for me ?!
Yeah!
Thank you!
Okay, let's start slowly. The only thing you have to do tonight is find the name of your main character.
Completed!
And it can not be Joey.
It's not.
Or Joseph.
Oh.

Hi!
Hi! Hey, Pete, you're back! Hey, look at this.
Wow! Skates!
Wow! You're a lot stronger than Chandler. He collapsed like a piece of paper. So how was your trip?
Well...
Oh, what did you bring me ?!
Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
Oh, it's going to go in my permanent collection.
You want a coffee?
Yeah, sure, that would be great.
Regular or decaffeinated?
Ah, who is always the closest.
Okay.
So ask me what I did today.
So what did you do today, Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the chef.
What?! Oh.

Hi.
Hey.
Where were you?
To the vet.
She's not going to get you one of those big plastic cones, right?
She says that Marcel's thing is not a phase. Apparently, he has reached sexual maturity.
Hey! He beat you.
She says that with time, he will become aggressive and violent.
What does that mean?
I will have to give it up.

AWW MEC! I can not believe I locked myself in again!
Wait for my friend!
Oh my God! What happened here? Have you done all this?
Of course I did it.
But we have not seen each other since then. Well, I'm coming to China, guess who's responsible for the search.
Julie! Julie, it's not great? I mean, is not it just a crotch kick, a fantastic pin on your neck?

May I come in?
Uh, yes, if you want too.
Make
Yes of course?
Me too.
Ok, Rachel, before something happens, I just want to set some basic rules.
It's about tonight.
I will not go through if it raises the question of "We".
Okay?
I just want it to be about what it is!
And uh, what is it that Ross?
The physical act of love.
What?! Are you insane?
Oh, so you were not trying to attract me with your nakedness?
Oh my God, did you see me ?! Oh!
You were not trying to attract me with your nakedness.
Noo !! No! You thought, did you really think I wanted to sleep with you ?!
No! No! No! No no no no.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross, you took off your shoes!
Have you just spent time with Ross?
It's perfect! Ok goodbye Monday! She will kill me.
Yes, the phone was in front. And it goes up there.

Ah Joey.
Joey Tribbiani.
Listen Joey, I have a problem, my dance captain called me, he has a relational crisis and can not leave Long Island.
So, does that mean that the hearing is off?
Look, Joey, since you have the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
What?!
Oh come on Joey, it's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand, head, head, head, no stuff, no stuff, big bend here, big sissone, sissone, sissone, slide your fingers back!
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Enjoy.
Goodbye.

Wow! Fortunately she has a
Oh, I can not believe it! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Oh, I can not believe that my sperm has a low motility because, let me tell you, when I grew up, they seem really in a hurry to win places!
!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry, there was no better news from your test last week, but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Okay.
Above all, even if your chances of conceiving by natural means are not great, you never know!
So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
Oh, damn it!
Do not worry, after a while he will fix the problem.
Ok, considering your situation, the options offering the best chance of success would be surrogacy, or insemination with the help of a sperm donor.
Okay.
You know, monogamy can be a complicated concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Well. Okay, now you will never know.
We laugh. Come on, tell us!
Yeah! Let's go there!
Well. There is a theory, put forward by Richard Leakey-

Hi, is Carol here?
No, she's at a teachers' meeting.
Oh, I just came to take my skull. Well, not mine, but ...
Come in.
Thank you. Yes, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to take it back to the museum.
What does it look like?
A bit like a big face without skin.
Yes, I know the concept. We can simply search for it.
Okay. Wow, you probably have a lot of books about being lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a class. Otherwise, they will not let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the turtle. A classic.
In fact, I read it to the baby.
The baby who is not yet born? Does not that mean you're ... crazy?
What, do not you think they can hear sounds?
You're not serious, I mean, you're really ... you really talk about it?
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up dude?
I am trppd ... in a cash machine vstbl ... wth
Oh my God! He's stuck in an ATM lobby with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yeah, as this thought never entered my mind.

and it was all before 10 o'clock.
The caterer rang and said it would be Kiev chicken instead of tarragon chicken.
And then the florist phoned to say there were no tulips.
Oh, and the most chilly has the carpel-tunel syndrome.
We are not going to be
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Well, yours too!

Where is Chandler?
Ah, he can not do it, he said he had his ... Whoa-oh!
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey, can I see you ok? You hide behind the coats.
Ok, listen, give me everything I can do.
Well, if you have nothing to copy, why are you going there?
Yeah, are you just going down there to see that sexy girl with the navel ring again?
Yeah! You want to come?
Yeah!

Well.
Well.
Well.
Well.
Okay. We will go there. It's not until six o'clock. We will go then.

Hey.
What's the problem?
Someone in the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck !!
Oh Willie is still alive!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, my mother called, they will post our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we look for a good picture of ourselves.
Oooh, I'm afraid it does not exist.
That's not true, there are some great pictures of us!
No, there are some great pictures of you standing next to a guy who goes like this
Oh my God! It's the creep that you are with the
I do not know what it is, I just can not take a good picture.
Oh, here is an excellent one.
Yes, I'm not in this.
I know, but look at me: all tanned.
Why are not you going to have portraits done by a professional photographer?
It's a good idea! I bet they have one of these wind turbines! You know
Yes it's great! Beside that, Chandler will not look so stupid.
Chandler, what are you saying?
Okay, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I go.

In addition, I was responsible for my company's transition from the KL-5 system to the GR-6 system.
You must have had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.
So let's talk a bit about your functions.
My functions? Okay.
Now you will be running an entire division, so you will have a lot of tasks.
I see.
But there may be 30 people under you so you can pay a certain amount.
Good to know.
We can go into details
No, please!
All right, we'll have a definitive answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence that you'll be fine.
Really?!
Absolutely. You can relax you have been excellent.
But who? The waitress I dated last month?
You know? Forget it!
No no no no no! Who were you talking about?
No, I-I-I-I do not know, I do not know
Okay!
Okay, well ...
I will see if I can have a room for the night and I ...
I will see you later!
Yes of course!

Hello my.
Hey hey. You want to hear something that fears.
I never have.
Chris says they are closing the bar.
No way!
Yes, apparently, they make it a kind of coffee.
Just coffee! Where are we going to go out now?
Had me.
May I have a beer?
Hey, did you choose a roommate?
You betcha!
Is this the Italian guy?
Um-mm, yeah that's it!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What what?
What?!
He was with her when he wrote this poem.
Look, 'My ship is empty with nothing inside.
Now that I have touched you, you seem ever more empty.
He thinks Monica is empty, she's the empty vase!
Do you really think that's what he meant?
Oh, totally. Oh, my God, oh, she seemed so happy.
Completed.

Hey!
Hi!
What are you doing here?
Ah, you know, this building is on my road paper so I ...
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
How did that happen?
Oh, well, the woman I interviewed was pretty tough, but thank God, guided me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she became happy and did not I did not want to be silent.
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
Look, I'm ah, I'm sorry for being so crazy and jealous and it's just that I love you so much, so ...
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
American.
Ameri-ccan.
American. You know it's a
Everybody!!

Good job Joe! Good game! Excellent!
You have loved? You really liked?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
What part exactly?
The whole! Can we go?
Oh no-no-no, give me some details.
I love the details, the details were the best part!
Hey, what about the kangaroo scene? Did you like this part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in an epic of the First World War.
You fell asleep!!
There was no kangaroo!
They did not take any of my suggestions!
It's to come my friend.
I will see you later.
Do not leave!
I am sorry.
I am really sorry!
Look!
This guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too!
Be angry with him!
Or call an ambulance.

Ok, listen, I think we have to tell Rachel that she ruined her dessert.
What?! What's with everyone? It's Thanksgiving, not ... the day of truth!
Yes, and I long to have this ring.
See, if I am not buried with this ring then my mind will wander in the lower world for all eternity
Ok, that's enough darling!
I do not know. Let me see the ring.
Awesome! Ok, here.
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And

What did you do?
Oh, you know, as usual, teach aerobics, party a lot too much.
Oh, and in case you're wondering, these are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you hold on for a moment? I have another call. I love it.
I know.
I returned.
So, are we going to meet or what?
Absolutely. Uh, how are you tomorrow afternoon? Do you know, Central Perk in the village, for example, five o'clock?
Great, I see you then.
Okay. Okay. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even if you make a good impression Bob, I think when she sees you tomorrow, she'll probably realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
I hope that when Bob does not show up, she will look for comfort in the open arms of the ironic stranger at the next table.
Oh my God. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure hurt, horny and alone. I did this

Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You would not believe what people put here!
Look!
Ok, does it look like a trash for you?
No.
This is my wedding.
Okay, you know what? We are really late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go !!
Well. You will watch it on video when we return.
That's Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, let's go! Goodbye, Pheebs!
Goodbye, Pheebs!
London baby !!
Oh, do you need a hug? You have nothing to bring me!

Hey!
Hey! So Estelle has organized a series of auditions for me tomorrow and I will recover my health insurance in a short time.
It's great, but should not you be in the bathroom immediately?
What?!
What's wrong?
Nothing!
Well, I had that blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, and then I fainted and uh, I have not been able to get up since.
But uh, I do not think it's serious.
It looks like a hernia. You must go to the doctor!
No way! "Kay, look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything, it will be because it gets me out of the stomach!
It's a hernia.
Why do I have to start exercising again? Cursed 15s!

I like your place! Where does this guy come from?
Uh, it's an 18th century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Oh wow! So, you are more than dinosaurs.
So much more.
Well, to summarize, we have fun, you look young.
Okay
But that's not enough. So here is the key to my apartment.
Really?!
Really.
You do not think it's too fast.

Get out!
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes please! So what's going on?
Uh, well ... Joey and I broke up.
Oh my God, what happened?
Joey is a great guy, but we are just ... so different! I mean, during your speech, he continued to laugh at homo erectus!
I knew it was him!
Anyway, I think it's for the best.
Hey, how are you?
I suppose.
There was hum ... there was another reason why I thought it was time to finish with Joey.
I began to realize that I had feelings for someone else.
Ok Geller. The last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Oh, Professor, we're kind of in a conversation here.
Yeah, can you throw it in the pool later?
Or we could throw you both into
Ok guys!
Please!
Are not we a little old for that?
I mean, we are scientists, right?
We are academics.
And more importantly ... you'll have to catch us first.
.
GO GO GO!

Go Go go!
Oh yes, now everyone wants to be under that hat!
Oy !!
What's all this sand?
Oh, yes, Bob said there could be flood damage.
Yeah, that's it, or he has a very big cat.

Ok, you see that blind guy right there? I'll break his head later.
Oh uh, my big scene is coming. Great scene to come.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling." Would she understand the difference?
Rachel? What are you doing?
Oh, I just can not look. It's too scary!
It's a diaper advertisement.
Oh yeah, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh !!!
Pizza delivery!
I will have it! I'll have that!
Hi!
Hi!
Hey, you want to eat something or uh, do you want to see how long you can throw that ball back and forth? Huh?
Uh, the ball thing.
Yeah?
Hey Ross, would not it be great if we could spend two hours running without dropping it ?!
uh
Okay!
Uh-oh.
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel is in the bathroom!
Dude, I did not think we were going to get there!
I know! Do not change hands, okay?

Hey.
Hey!
How did it go with Erin?
Oh, amazing! We had the best time!
Yay !! Oh yes, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
No!
No!
No!
You were absolutely right!
It's so much better than the first time we went out.
You know?
It was so weird that we were really nervous.
You did not sleep together?
Yes, it really calms me down.
And!
We have so much in common!
She loves sandwiches, sports, even if she is a fan of the Met, it's not a problem at the moment, but if we had kids,
Oh my God! I'm listening to you talk about having children. Oh my Joey. Oh, please do not get married before me.
Okay.

How does she do that?
I can not sleep in a public place.
Do you want to watch it? She is so peaceful.
Oh! What what? ...Hi.
It's good, you know, you've just knocked yourself out.
What's going on with you?
I did not sleep last night!
Why?
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they are both a bit insecure in bed.
Oh, and deaf.
So, they must constantly reassure each other to have fun.
You do not know how strong they are!
If you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thank you.
Ew! What is it? Something has exploded!
It's just his water break. Calm down, will you?
Break water, what do you mean? What is water that breaks?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

Are you crazy? I mean, Joey, go kill yourself, he'll kill you.
Okay! Do not you think I thought about that?
How can you not know which one?
I mean it's amazing.
I mean, was it Gina?
Which one is Gina?
Black and tall hair, with the earrings of the plane.
No, no, no, it's Dina.
You see, you can not tell which one is which one either, dwha !!
I do not know, you thought "See you on Saturday" was funny.
Look honey, Mark is in fashion, all right, I like having a friend with whom I can share things like that.
You would never want to go to a conference with me.
Pa-haa !! I would like to go with you.
Really!?
Yes, I have clothes, I choose them even.
I mean, because I know I could be a fashion designer.
Okay. Honey, I'd like you to come with me. What?
What should I wear, now I am nervous.

: I know, we did it !! Hey, it was amazing, huh ?!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
: Thank you, listen, thank you very much Tribbiani ,. Oh my God, look at the time, I have to take the bus for the ball.
Oh, ok, good luck.
Yeah.
Unless you want to practice Foxtrot again? Where is the Tango?
: Ahh, thank you but no. You see, I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Okay.
Yeah.
Go get them Treeger.
: Right. Hey, do you want to come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really?
: Yes, you could dance very well with her, she is the same size as me.
No, it's okay.

Oh my God, it's so stressful! How do you do that?
Unfortunately, I do not get many reminders then
Is it a good sign that they asked us to stay after the audition?
Who knows?
Okay, we've reduced the number of people to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye! So long! Later!
Oh that's great! I could even play Ben's father!
Yeah!
In fact, this can not happen.
Yes, because you all look so different, we put you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
So it will be either you two or you two.
Dude, it's going to be a little weird.
Yeah, that's it.
No, we're going to be like best friends, that's why it's going to be weird.

Ok, come on, I can not get married until I have something old, new, borrowed and blue.
Ok, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Ok, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Please!
Are you kidding?
I ... I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose - I mean ... I'm not proud of that, but I really am.
And all because of you, wonderful, amazing.
I think you have a concussion.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
You are welcome. I am sorry. Did I hurt you?
It's worth it. You know what, you know what? It's not.

Wow! This Mike thing was interesting! I do not know what will happen with Phoebe and David.
I do! You want a clue? eh? "I do, I do it".
Ok, I feel like it's kind of a play on words, because you're pink with barely controlled joy.
David will propose to Phoebe.
What? Why?
Because we were talking about ways to defeat Mike, I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Chandler, we talked about it.
You are not supposed to give people advice!
Now, could not you just do some kind of inappropriate joke?
I
They've only been out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hooked on Mike!
She will say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover and Phoebe will be left alone
Man, it's a little
Oh, that's not what you want ...

This is my dad, Paul Stevens. Dad, it's Ross Geller.
It's a pleasure to meet you Paul.
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to speak to me as Mr. Stevens.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
So Ross, what's your problem?
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
Why can not you have a girlfriend of your age?
Now that's funny. Umm. It's not funny.
I
Okay.
I can, I can see that.
Uh, but I think if you give me a chance, I can change my mind.
Okay.
What?
Okay. I will give you a chance to change your mind. You have a minute.
Dad!
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, okay, I'll bring you a tape, huh?
So, do you have Matt Lauer's clothes here? May be? Just those who have not been cleaned yet?

Ooooohh!
Oh yes, I'm sure. And suddenly, his hands were no longer the problem.
Was it ...?
Oh, scouts could have camped here.
"Ooo", what?
Uma Thurman.
Oh!
The actress!
Thank you Rachel.
So, what are you going to do?
You must tell him!
You must tell him!
It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist problem!
Guys?
Guys?
Oh, yes, you must tell him.
Feminist question. That's where I went!
She will hate me.
Yes, well ...

Would you marry me?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Yes, you have the ring?
Yes, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Oh! Oop!
OK, now, are you going out of here? I want it to be a surprise and she will know it.
Yeah-yeah guys. Get out of here!
Hi guys.
You are beautiful.
Oh thank you! What is going on?
We are really excited about this charity event we need to attend.

Ok, Ross?
I'm very hot, so I'm going to take off my sweater.
Now, I'm letting you know it's
Yes! It's hilarious!
I am sorry. I'm finished. I'm finished.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
Not really. I mean, you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Okay. Ok, that's right! But you know I do not bother so easily.
What?! You are totally embarrassed!
No I do not! Ross, I think I'm just a safer person than you.
Is it true?
Yeah.
Hey lady! I do not care how much you want it! Okay?! I am

I can not believe!
I did it!
I cycled!
I never thought I could do that!
Thank you Ross.
Oh hey, do not thank me, thank you yourself. You are the one who faced his fears and finally overcame them.
Well yes, but then
Yeah-Not-but-but-but-but! We are just going home and taking a shower. Now, it's not scary, is it?
It depends on what you mean by us.

Hey, both of you should be up there with me.
I mean, you two are my, I mean, I'm lucky to just have a good
Thanks dude.
I have to go check something here.
What baby
Wuss total!

David?
Phoebe! Hi!
Oh my God!
Wow, you look amazing.
Yeah. What are you doing here?
Well, I'm back from Minsk ... permanently.
What happened?
Well, remember how I was trying to achieve positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Yeah?
After eight years of research, I discovered that it was impossible.
It's great that you're back! How are you?
Well, well, life is beautiful ...
Well!
Oh, I see someone.
Oh, good for you.
She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and ... well, it's actually because of you, really, we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with this guy from Mike, and I just said "Boy, I want this".
Mike and I broke up.
This means that we can continue to try, but there is a good chance that this will never happen to us.
Oh my God!
I am sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Well, we will ... we will understand that.
I know.

Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes that you can try.
Wow! It looks great!
Yeah! Ok, this one is a mushroom hat. Umm, this one is made of Bologna.
And-and-and-and-and-toothpicks?
You kissed another woman!
Call it the same ?!
Okay!
Well, I'll go get them in the water.
Wait, have you stolen the wedding of these people?
No-no, I took them in the lobby of the hotel.
Yeah, they think they can charge me for a dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they have another idea in mind.
Hey!
My sweater!
I'm looking for that for a month!
Oh my God!!
Oh my God!

Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you're supposed to be!
Huh?
Because I really can not understand it!
I speak to you and nothing.
You look at me, and it's nothing.
Nothing.
Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you have a story, that's nice.
I have a question about this scene.
Yes?
Well, I do not understand why Adrienne is attracted to Victor.
Peel the onion. First of all, he is handsome.
Yeah.
I think my character will need a little more reason than that.
Oh, hey, how about this one.
Ah, it says in the script!
You know ah, I-I do not know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script that you're a slut.
It does not say that in the script.
It does it in mine!

I can not
Yeah! You have to tell a girl before recording it. Such a rookie error.
You know who has an excellent video camera?
Greg and Jenny?
Do you still want to call them? I want to call them.
Let's call them.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought any souvenirs to their friends!
Hello? Eighth Deli Street?
Hey, hang up! You have food poisoning just by talking to this place.
Sorry, wrong number.
Here you are.
Hello? It's still the sausage!
Okay! I'm going to have a sandwich!
I do not think this number is accurate!
Oh come on !!

I have to go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's really late now
Hi Mom. Listen, I made an appointment with Dr. Bazida and ... Excuse me? Did you know it's not mom?
Her name is Ronni. She is a pet.
Sure. So how long has it been ...
Do you remember when you were little, I took you to the navy yard and showed you the big ships?
Since?!
No, it's only been six years.
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so that you know that I have not always been such a terrible guy.
... Joe.
Have you ever been in love?
... I know.
So you have not. You burn your tomatoes.
You are one to talk.
Joe, your father is very much in love. And the worst is with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me that one of them is Ma.
Of course, of course, one of them is Ma. What's your problem?

Everything will be alright. Okay, Dick?
Hi, I'm Guru Saj - Whoa !! It's supposed to be a duck, right? Because otherwise, it's waaay out of my league.
Hey, Rachel, how was the job?
Oh great. Although I sat where there was no chair.
By the way, Ross has fallen into a box of your things.
Oh, well, I guess that was the one that was coming.
I'm just going to throw it away, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and ...
Something is wrong?
No nothing.

And then, and then you talked about what the Mesozoic era would be in the 21st century.
Yeah, that's it?
Yeah.
Yes !!
We are Zack teeth!

Dude, I'm sorry for what I said!
No, no, you're right, it's a ridiculous name!
It's not so bad.
Yes it is! From now on, I do not have a name.
So, are you just Bing?
Because we have won our apartment!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
No! Ace is weak! Ace, two, three, four!
I do not know. Ooh! Ooh! Look! Ah-ha!
Very good, cut, resume, resume.
Okay.
Come in apartment! Come in apartment! Oh! I know that the queen is high!
Uh-huh, not as high as it worked! King!
Yes baby!
But we resume! We pick up again!
Why?!
I do not know!
Tickets please! This is the baby yard!
Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so crazy about? They recover the apartment!
No they did not!

You know, I do not think we brought enough material. Have you forgotten to pack the baby's anvil?
It will be worth it.
It's a known fact that women love babies, okay?
Women love guys who love babies.
It's this sensitive thing.
Quick, point it to that group of girls there.
Maybe one of them will escape.
No, no wait, to have them, we have one, badly gone.
All right, give me the baby.
No, I got it.
No seriously.
Oh, seriously, do you want it?
Hello.
Well, do not think me shameless, but me?
Do you want to feel it?
Oh yes. He has that sweet smell of baby. Get a whiff of his head.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
Well, we are great guys.
Goodbye.

Well not really.
I mean technically it's not against the rules or anything, but it's frowned upon.
In particular by the professor we met last night, Judge von Holierthanthou.
Well, Ross, be careful now. You do not want to have a reputation as you know, Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What should I do?
Well Ross, that seems pretty clear.
I mean what's more important?
What do people think or how do you feel, huh?
Ross, you must follow your heart.
Joey it's so nice.
Hey.
Hey hey! So, how did it go with Dana? One reason I should leave an open block of time, says Thursday?
I could not do it.
You could not do it?
Hey, relax, I just need more time. We are going to dinner tonight.
What?! You're still going out with her!
To go out with whom?
Uh, Dana Keystone from the university.
Oh yes! Was not she uh
No, it was Dana Caplin.
Joey! You did not even know her!
Ah no matter!

Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my robot boyfriend ?!
Do not touch it!
Okay!
Okay.
Umm, Wayne, at the same level as me.
Okay?
I continue to hear all these rumors that I could be fired.
Okay, they even have actors who come to read for me!
Come on man, you have to give me a second chance!
I mean, I like-I love this little guy!
Ah ah!
Ok, that's why you did not want me to touch him, did you?
Here!
Okay?
Stupid!
I can not believe!
God!
Hey, how are you?

Hey.
Hi. Look uh, about what happened earlier ...
No, hey, well, I understand perfectly. You were, you were stressed.
I was going to give you a chance to apologize.
Why? For letting me throw myself out of your office?
You did not have
Yeah, excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our wedding anniversary, boy, I'm a con
But I told you that I did not have time!
Yeah, well, you never have time. I mean, I do not feel like I have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
You want me, do you want me to leave my job so that you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
I know.
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
What?
But I can not tell you.
Okay, but it would not be easier if you had to tell me something you could tell me.
Well, of course, in a perfect world. But no, I promised not to say anything and I swore to love all my gods.
Okay. Does this have to do with Ross and Rachel?
No.
Does it have to do with Joey?
No.
Does it have to do with Chandler and that sock he keeps close to his bed?
No, but let's go back to that later!

Hi!
Richard!
In fact, I'm not here to complete the chef.
Oh, oh, I'm fine when people come back to accompany the chef.
Since I have nothing better to do!
So what's up?
It was great to see you the other night.
Oh, nice to see you too. Did you come here to tell me that?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you that I still love you.

One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be fine.
So, forcing her to marry Bobby is going to get there?
May be! Well! Well, then, uh, what kind of music Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can not!
Joey, I'm very scared of that.
But I really think I can do it, I'm just going to need help.
And Bobby will be here all the time.
You speak that I am! And to answer your previous question, we are rap for gangsters.
Listen, Rachel told me how easy you had made it. Why can not you do that for me?
Because! Because you are my little sister!
And you are my big brother!
I mean, you are my favorite guy in the whole world.
I'm not even afraid to talk to mom and dad about it.
I was afraid to tell you.
I would be afraid of them, but okay.
Joey, I can not stand the idea of ​​having this baby with you angry with me.
I want him to have his uncle.
Will my baby have his uncle Joey?
Of course he's going to have his uncle Joey!
We will be fine. I mean, even if we are not married, this baby will be so loved. Not only by us.
It is true! By his uncle too!
And by you
Ok Bobby, why do not you come here and give them a moment.
Come here!
No! Seriously! What's wrong?!

I had a great time tonight.
Me too. I'm really glad Monica invited us.
I would love to ask you to come in, but my sister is visiting and I think she sleeps on the couch.
Are you a sister? Your sister is asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, it's Rachel.
Hi!
Nice to meet you. I wish you told me we had company, I would repair myself!
As if it would help.
You are so bad!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are so dead! I'll take you.
Uh, it was very nice to meet you.

Oh my God, this is Victoria's Secret model. Something ... something from Goodacre.
Hi mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I'm stuck in an ATM lobby with Jill Goodacre!
Yes, I'm fine I'm stuck in the bank, in an ATM lobby.
Jill says vestibule ... I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone ... I do not know, a guy.
Oh! A guy. A guy. Hey Jill, I saw you with a guy last night. Yes he was

I say, drew!
Do you see someone right now?
Og-ee-op, I do not ask for me, I mean no, I'm not gay, I'm not asking you to go out
I am not I am not I am not gay!
Personal purchases? What is it? Do you like where you walk with wealthy rich people and tell them what to buy?
Uh-huh.
That sounds good!
Hey!
Uh, excuse me, we changed apartment. You can not eat anymore, it's food, this sauce train has ended.
There is sauce?
If you have the big apartment, you have to deal with people who come all the time.
This refrigerator needs to be filled, okay, it's now your department.
What are you doing?
I think I left a donut here.

So, in conclusion, the lines go up, so I'm happy.
Great work team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.
Phil!
Good work.
Stevens!
Path to follow!
Joel-burg, maniac!
I love you!
Bing!
Good job, I could not have done it without you.
Thank you sir.
Oh excuse me. I forgot my towel, you know, by accident.
Of course you did.
Forgot something else too bastard!
And you?
You do not feel left behind or anything?
No, not at all, it's ridiculous.
Everyone has one, and you want one too. Is not it?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do it!
Now, get out of here, you!

Hi Bob.
Hey! How's my friend Toby today?
If I see him, I will ask.
Toby!
Eh eh! Bing? Was it six-year-old Bob that you just mentioned too?
Yeah!
Oh, so you know each other.
We are semi-first name.
What do you think of adding it to our team?
Bob? Ooh, work here with us? Everyday? Yes, I do not know if he has what it takes.
Really? They like it at six o'clock.
But it's eleven. It's almost twice as difficult here.

Hey! Guess what I have for your wedding!
A lean and weird appointment with a hanger for the head?
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tuxedo! But not just any, the Batman tux!
What?
It is true! Made specifically for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit movie in which he was filmed by Batman.
You can not wear that! I'm wearing the famous tuxedo! The James Bond tuxedo!
So?
So if you wear this, you will make mine less special.
Sorry, I do not like the idea of ​​saying when I say "yes", he says to himself, "Yeah, I'll do it too!"
Well, we still have a problem.
Yeah!
With what?
Well, we are trying to find someone to celebrate our wedding and they are all boring or boring or you know, they can not stop watching women.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, we get
No! No! It's ... it's a real thing! Anyone can be ordered on the Internet and perform as a wedding or anything else!
Are you serious?
Yes! One of my friends did it and it's totally legal!
I call him!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much, but none of you are getting married to us.
Does calling it mean nothing ?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!

You see, I see ... a great passion in your future.
Really?
I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she rubs her head and stands up]
It's never going to happen.

Everyone knows!
It was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
Look, Monica, I know, all right, you know, I could not sleep for a month because of a dot of ink on one of the couch cushions.
Well, you could turn the cushion over.
Yeah, I would have unless I had a big patch of spaghetti on the other side.
What?!?!
Ok, that's what I'm talking about. I need to live in a country where people can spread.
You can reverse. In the sink.
Aw, darling, it's not your fault, you know, who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I continue to live here, I do not see it.
I love you too.
Aww, well. What?
What? I just said.
No you are not, you wonder what cushion it is.

Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Uh-huh.
I would like to live with you Ross; It's awesome! Thank you!
Well, I'm just happy to help you.
Wow! I am so happy for you. It's not terrible, not stupid.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what that means to me!
I mean, I mean, I'm going to be homeless.
You just saved me!
You are my hero!
Hero, I uh, I do not know, okay.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please! You will say things now, will not you?
No.
No, I will not do it.
But I should tell you this, it's exactly the same thing that happened to my roommate Denise.
She moved with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he did not like it, but he did it, and it just exploded!
And that's how she ended up living with me!
Ok, it's a lie.

Ugh!!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross's house.
Oh, I must miss counting or something.
Heck!
She is not there anymore.
Oh, I'm watching, Ross is watching the movie.
No Joey, I think he's just watching TV.

... damn it, hire the girl! Ok, everyone is ready?
Uh, listen, I just want to thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the dress.
Me?
It's awesome.
Well, I'll take another espresso. Can I get you another coffee with milk?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's all?
Yes, it was really difficult.
Oh, yes, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Ok, you were not there.

Wow! It's ah, it's pretty cool!
Not bad?
You will have to forgive my roommate, he wanted to get married to that.
We do not have $ 50, but would you be willing to trade for it? We have a canoe.
You know, I, I really do not think we need a canoe.
You have to take the canoe!
All right, just take the entertainment center, then when you get home, throw the canoe!
We do not throw it! I built this canoe!
Good for you!!

Pheebs?
Yeah?
Okay. So I guess that's right, wait here then. Hi. I need a fake ticket for Yemen.
A ticket for Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just need a fake ticket.
I'm sorry sir, I do not understand.
What would you give to a child if he wanted a ticket to play?
Do you travel with a child?
No.
Okay, you know what, she's going to think I'm giving you a credit card, but what I'm really going to do is give you a library card.
Sir, a ticket to Yemen costs $ 2,100 and we do not take library cards.
What's the problem? Something is wrong? Do you have to stay?

Okay, but it's the last time.
With a chick here and a chick there.
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick - chickeeeen.
Hey.
Hey.
How is she?
She?
Well, do not you think she's a girl?
I do not know. I can not say, which has never been back too fast.
Anyway, I have to change, I meet actors for a drink.
Excuse me?
What?
Ok, well, so that's it. Go with Vince.
Yes, but Jason is really sensitive.
Although sensitive is important, choose it.
Yeah.
Oh, of course, go with the wet chicken.
Jason is not a sissy!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.

Hi.
So, uh, apparently, people know the history of Europe?
Yeah.
Listen to that, everyone, um, who came across who does not matter.
I mean, I think it would have happened anyway.
I mean, if you did not initiate it, I-I-I know I would have it.
It was an incredible night.
It was. It was an incredible night.
You think it was incredible?
Do we still have a name?
Not yet.
That's good, for now we're going to call it Baby Girl Green.
Oh no, little girl Geller-Green.
Hello Little Girl

Ah-ha, nowhere to go!
I do not like sitting here! I'm just going to finish
No Rachel! They arrived first!
Why does Ross do that?
DANGER
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on these women!
No, it's okay. Do not worry about that.
Oh, look! It will leave a stain!
Rachel! Hey! It's good! You're at Joey's!
Really?
Yeah! Look!
I have never lived like this before.
I know.
Okay, do not waste it, I'm talking about his still food.

Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
I do not know, but one of the extras did it! Hi, listen, Rach. Thank you again for coming to watch my scenes!
Oh, please! Honey, the fact that you want me to be here to support you is ... OH MY GOD! Is it Christian Sanders? He is so
Also so
Oh, in my head, he did pretty "not gay stuff"!
Well, at Christmas, he and Santa Claus did some really gay stuff!
OK, you must promise that you will never tell Ross that I told you.
On what?
He is preparing your birthday party.
Oh my God! I love it!
You better act surprised.
On what?
My surprise party!
What a surprise party?
Oh stop. Joey already told me.
Well, he did not tell me.
Hey, do not look at me. It's Ross's thing.
It's so typical. I am always the last to know everything.
No you are not. We tell you things.
Yuh-huh!
I was the last to know when Chandler was bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
I was the last to know when you had a crush on Joey when he moved in.
Looks like I was penultimate.

Chandler, your father still has not sent an answer.
Oh! Right. Uh, maybe it's because I did not send him an invitation.
Chandler! It's your father; he should be at the wedding.
I do not even know the man. Okay? We are not so close. I have not seen him for years.
What are you going to do when he finds out that we did not even ask him ?!
Well, he does not need to know!
It's not like we're running in the same circles.
I spend time with you guys and he plays in a show in Las Vegas.
Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.
Believe me, you do not want it either.
Okay?
No one is going to look at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a dress without back.
So what! As long as he does not wear a white dress or sail, I do not care.
Okay, I think I need to go shopping.

Hi! Who is here?
It's okay'?
Who are you?
I guess you would not believe me if I said I'm Kurt Douglas, huh?
No, no, Rachel, do not understand! He can not see us!
No Yes! The groom can not see the bride!
I'm not going to marry Chandler!
Not after that!
Ok, guys, relax. I doooo.
I have to go.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, oughta do it.

Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Okay.
So, Pheebs, what's the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well, yes, but then I remembered that I had started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was at the top of the pyramid but anyway, uh, what is this book?
Excuse me, may I, can I burn one?
OK, all right, what's so funny here?
I thought you had not smoked.
Oh, I thought you meant marijuana cigarettes, you know?
Do you know what I mean, like dubbies?
And actually, I thought, "Wow, these guys are crazy!"
But no, I actually smoke all the regulars, all the time.
We get high.
Oh me too.
I am kidding.
Oh me too.

Oh, are you sure you're fine?
Yeah.
Does it still hurt?
Yeah.
What a beautiful idea. All your clothes match. I will do that.
Hi.
Hey, how did it go?
Excellent.
We tore up this couple and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine.
You know what? You are right. I
Good for you Pheebs!
Okay.
Ok, if you also have microphones, I did not mean

That sucks! I did not know I had to stay up all night before going to this stupid sleep clinic! I am so tired!
It is 6 o'clock.
Yeah
Hi!
Hey, I heard that Joshua and you were going to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think it's really cool.
Yeah, Rachel, I think you're doing really well.
Manipulate it?
What do you mean by manipulation?
There is nothing to manage.
Now, maybe I'll have a problem with that if it were not for me and Joshua.
You know, they are not going to get married anyway!
What?
Come on!
They rushed into this case so fast that it's ridiculous!
I mean, are they going to be engaged for what?
One year?
And somewhere on the way, one of them will realize what he did and they cancel everything.
I tell you, you're going to dance at my wedding before dancing there.
What is that?!
What, did you think it would reassure me to give me things that I will not be able to use for two months ?!
That sucks!
Okay, what's my next present?
!

Okay, there is a nuclear holocaust, I am the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
I have some preserves.
Hey guys! Look at this! Look at this baby, dug me a hole!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole !!
Ow !! Ow !!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
My drink?
Oh, I had to say that after you left.
Say what? Exactly.
That you enjoyed the occasional excessive consumption of drinks.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that's it! I leave! You are just a horrible person!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
If you become very sensitive about it!
I do not want to lose you.
What if I create a job for you?
I will make you a buyer assistant in this department.
Say more things like that.
You can have your own office and an increase! In force tomorrow.
I would need an expense account.
Completed!
And an assistant.
Sophie, come here!

Monica? You will be very proud of me. I have just received appointments with two incredibly cute nurses.
Oh my!
They are nurses.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us on Saturday night! What are you saying?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I do not think so.
What?
What are you talking about?!
It was you who told me to defeat Ross and move on.
I pass, and you continue with me.
Come on, give me a good reason why you do not want to go.
Umm, why not give
What?
Harder than it looks. Is not it?
Okay, you come with me and I also told them that if we're still there when they go down, we'll go to the cafeteria and have a few
Yes! There is always room for
Joey, how are you doing
Oh, it's easy. Yes, I can do it with anything. Look uh, grandma's chicken salad

Hello, it's Monica ...
Yeah???
Oh...
OK, yes, we'll be right, we'll go down.
Thank you.

Okay. Bring it on.
Wait no, honey, darling, throw it at me, throw it at me.
Here you are.
It almost hit my face.
A stripper at a bachelor party, it's so cliché. Why do not you have a magician ?!
Well, if the wizard can open my beer with his cheeks, then all is well.

Hey!
Hey!
You know, I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh my god, me too!
You know, I thought if we had a big fight and uh, we broke up for a few hours
Yeah?
Technically, we could make love again. What do you think, authoritarian and domineering ?!
The marriage is extinguished, sloppy and immature!
It's me! Come on!
Okay. But wait, we can not. My cousin Cassie is in the spare room, we are supposed to have lunch.
Well, get rid of her, haunting and shrill.
Acute?! The wedding is back!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you too.
So, are you ready to leave?
Yeah.
Chandler!
I will be right with you.

That's all, it's a third nipple.
You know?
Just your third running nipple.
You know?
You can remove it.
Cut out this baby right away!
Take off your shirt and see what it is. What are you doing?
I'm just showing you my third nipple at the end of the line.
It's not a third nipple.
No?
First of all, it's on your ass.
So what is it?
Wait a minute, hold on. Johnson! Do you want to come here for a moment?
I am with Hamilton!
He is good at things back, bring him too.

Uh, it's an excellent wine.
It's France in Europe Western Europe. You know, a few years ago, I was traveling all over western Europe.
Really?
Uh-hmm-Wait! It's improving. Uh, yes I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
Anyway, uh, I was ... I was hiking
I love to hike!
Oh that's great! I was walking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
I understood!
So? Congratulations you two, I did not even know you were married.
Oh we do not have.
No no. we
What?!
Uh, we are ... we only get this baby together, but that's all.
Why?!!
Well uh, we're just not here, see? But we are very excited about it.
Oh. So shut me up.
Tell me just how.
Uh-oh, I feel another coming.
Sid-you, lucky deaf bastard.

Drop it, Ross.
Yeah, well, you did not know Chi Chi.
Have you all promised?
Yeah! We promise! We will be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your little friend to filter must stay out!
Hey, Pheebs.
"Dear Mrs. Buffay.
Thank you for pointing out our mistake.
We credited your account with five hundred dollars.
We are sorry for the inconvenience and hope you will accept this -
Bye.
Yes?
What are you doing'?
Ooh.

Oh my God, darling, we are so made to be together. We both have copies of
Honey, both.
Hey! Good advice on this thing Joey!
Yeah? The problem of work?
Oh it was perfect! I mean it was really like he was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him?
Oh that's not important. The fact is that I really think that everything will be fine.

Ok, I have some, do you want to put them in her panties?
No thanks, mom!
Oh, no, hello, that, that, you have to say, because I'm pregnant.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Very good, so good.
I really, really appreciated. Very exotic.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua did not call.
I mean, you would think he would be worried that I would not come to his club.
Ugh, you know what makes matters worse, Ross is happy in Vermont!
Come on! Look where you are !!
When you get a second, another set of daiquiris.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And do not let me go without the name of this type of carpet.
Ahh, go! You know what, you know what, I think I'm just going home and calling Kathy.
Well, if you think that will help.
No!
It was a test!
In a few hours, I'm really going to get drunk and I want to call Kathy and you'll have to stop me!
And after that, I'm going to get drunk, I'm going to call Janice
You should! How is she?
Ohhh !!
I think someone needs another dance trick.

Okay, I definitely taste the nutmeg.
You do?
You do not? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layperson.
This and arrogance.
Hey.
Hey! How was the sail?
Wow thank you!
Joe?
Yeah!
Uh, did you have a lot of sex?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, that's just the reason I ask the question, it's because I could not, I mean, I really wanted to, but I could not.
Uh, there was an incident.
Do not worry about this man, it happens.
It happened to you?
Yeah! Once.
Well, what did you do?
I did it anyway.

'Supper? 'Yo dude?
Take what you want, please do not hurt me.
So you play a little
Yes, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the stupidest person can watch, you are 19 years old.
Come on man, how old are you ?!
Young! You are a child-man okay ?! Now go change because everyone is ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
And they knew?
Ok, Ross, what is it really about?
Look, it's at home and I want to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, I'll find another place to do the rest of my appointments. I just do not know what the problem is!
The big problem is that I do not want strangers naked and fat in my apartment when I want to relax with a beer-puzzle! Cold beer.

Ok, listen, it will not hurt them, right?
Do you still have to bring him back here?
I did not want to leave him alone.
Well?
We had our first fight this morning.
I think this has to do with my late work.
I said things that I did not want to say, and he threw dung ...
You know, if you go to work late, I could watch for you.
Oh, that would be great!
Okay, but if that's the case, make sure it looks like you're here to see it, all right, and you do not like doing it as a favor for me.
Okay, but if he asks, I will not lie.

Okay, check.
Look at this.
It says here that there is a place where you can go to rent videos from all museums!
"It's almost as good as being there."
It's better! You can not go to a museum in underwear!
Oh-ho! I bet the UK version is gooooood!

Uh, can I help you?
Yes, I spoke to you on the phone, I am the woman who got stuck with the race car bed.
It's like I told you, I can not do anything. You signed for this, Monica Velula Geller.
Okay, buffoon, look, we want to see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Hey! You can not go back!
Oh my God.

So, it must be pretty cool for you, huh?
I mean, your father told me that you have a few days off school and you no longer have to sell those cookies.
Well, I wanted to sell cookies a bit. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp and sits in a
Wow, you ah, do you really like all that space stuff, huh?
Yeah.
My father says that if I spent as much time helping him clean his apartments as dreaming about space, he could afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think a lot of flats should be cleaned to go to India.
No, in Atlantic City, daddy loves slot machines. He says he's going to double the money my grandmother left me in college.
Oh, I do not know if it's a good idea.
Oh. Listen, just friends, I will not stain you. I promise.
No, I just think it's too early.
No, it's not too early, I had lunch at eleven o'clock.

I invented cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now, you want to get that money back.
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for?
It's not a real game! I did it!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it.
I do not know.
But I can see through your leaf.
Yes it's her.
But what do you know?
No matter, I will never meet her anyway.
Why?
Because it is impossible to find his apartment! She lives in a universe parallel to a girl, or something like that.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, the seventh apartment on the left!
No no. She lives on the
No, those first two windows are the hall.
And you know each other over there, it's the stairs.
You did not count well.
I did

Monica, betting on the apartment, I do not know.
Rachel, I did not miss a question of the whole match. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Do you have the written answers there?
No! Stable like a rock! Now, are you with me?
All right, let's do it.
Come on!
Okay.
Okay, gentlemen, you're the first to get up.
Okay.
Okay.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins-stop now. What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalkeeper?
Big goalkeeper.
Correct. Rachel's complaints
Dangerous Liaisons
Correct. His current favorite film is ...
Weekend at Bernie's
Well, listen, why are not you just doing your Phase Two strip club with us?
Yeah, we can be guys!
No you can not.
Come on! Let's be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
You do not want to be guys, you'd be hairy and do not live that long.
You know, you stop mouthing and take off, you come with us and watch naked girls dancing!
Okay.
I am sorry.

And you know what, I just realized that in the past year, I only went out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
You have to help me here, you have to prepare me, you have to get me back in the game.
Well, that should not be a problem. I mean that I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible heterosexuals.
Pete, can I find you something else?
Yes, a piece of cheesecake and a date if given to you.
You and I have not touched on this?
Hmm, come on, you just told him you.
Oh, the only reason you want to go out with me because of my blonde wig, her big boobs and the fact that I'm serving you.
Well, if it were true, I would go out with Aunt Ruth.
And the two times we went out were just embarrassing.
Come on, you think she should go out with me, right?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
I mean, it's not a pretty picture in the morning, you know what I mean.
This wig is in disarray and her breasts thrown into the night, you know.
I mean really think about it.
Ho-ho, I'll do it.

I think I read that somewhere!
It's not funny, it's physically impossible!
Okay?
Depending on the species, I would have to be six feet long ...
It's not funny!
!
I respectfully disagree.
I can not believe you put that on my page of old!
We do not care? Nobody reads these things
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
I do not have a page.
Oh oh oh! I respectfully disagree !!

I know I miss you too. I can not wait to see you. I love you. Goodbye.
Ok, what's here? Rocks?
No, no, it's my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I will really miss this apartment. You know, Ben-Ben took his first steps there.
Ohh Hey, do you remember when I met this thing and it stunned me a bit?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I did not have to move.
Uh, are you saying that you're not completely happy with that?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me the choice
You
Why?
Hey guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift store. Get up! Get up! Get up!

I left a bra that dries on the shower rod, you do not think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatized?
Hey, if mom can have a wife, dad can have a bra.
Ohh, it's time to go.
Oh, no-no-no, you see, this clock is a little fast, we have 17 minutes.
Uh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
Two times?
Well, it's ambitious.
Hey, you can ignore that.
It's Carol with your son!
The morning is here! The sun is out! The sky is clear, the morning has arrived! The morning is here!
HEY !! Do you
Oh come on! The morning is here! The morning is here! The morning is here! The sun is out!
I
Are you kidding? I love this guy! The morning is here! The morning is here-
Stop that! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica, you do not even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
You know what? I am
I am sorry. I am really sorry.
Okay.
See, it's a
Shut up! This place is a hole!

Very good friend, it's time to turn around.
No no!
No, no-n-n-n-no !!
You go to a clinic!
You go to a clinic and a pajamas shop!

Are you under the sheet?
Yes.
Great, let's start. How is the pressure?
Pleasant! Wow Phoebe you are good!
By stating an obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird, that's it.
No. Ooohh
That's right, you just enjoy.
Oh. Oh yes! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yes!
Okay.
Oh my God Phoebe !! Oh that's it! That's all! Just there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh

Hi!
Oh, Alice, hello!
Thank you.
I'm so glad you could come because I have an emergency at home.
Oh my God, who died about it ?!
Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-disaster. Can you help me?
Become a theater critic!
I am hurt! A plague on your two houses!
By the way, he dropped me tonight after reading my report.
Oh, class.
Yes! I know how to choose them, huh? You know I gave up a soap party for that!
Wow! Yes, I gave up my job too.
Really. What?
Uh, scratch cats.
Hey, I tell you what.
Let me take you home.
We will go to each newsstand and burn each copy of their newspaper.
Why post?
Oh, did not you see the Post?
No you?
No why?

Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Uh, well I have an audition in the street and I spilled the sauce on the front of my shirt. Do you have one more?
Yes of course. Umm here.
Awesome. You have something that is not
Yes, I do not think so, Joe.
Okay, I guess it'll be fine.
Hey, listen, what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, why?
What would you think about taking out my tag assistant? I will pay.
Uh, Rachel, I have to say it's going to take a lot of money for me to go out with a guy.
I'm not asking you to go on a
Really? Because I could use the money.
Joey, he just came to town and I know he has no friends.
Just take it to like a ball game or something.
I will really appreciate it.
Yeah OK.
Yeah?
Sure no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Yeah!
Okay.

Odor problem in litter? Do not change your kitten, change your kitten litter.
Sorry, Pheebs.
Yeah. It's okay?
No! Sorry, I just thought you were someone else. Hi!
Hi. Listen, I was just going to leave a message, is not your big birthday dinner tonight?
Yeah. Well, uh .....
Rachel, how are you?
Yes, I'm fine
You want to talk, I mean can I come?
No! Really, no, please, please, it's okay.
Okay, okay, I'm coming and I'm bringing Chinese food.
Oh, yes, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
It's for me.
Oh. Okay goodbye.

Go, pick up, pick up!
Hello?
Transit Authority?
Yes hello.
I'm researching for a book and wondering what someone could do if he left a baby in a city bus.
Yes, I realize it would be a very stupid character.
Hi, here's the deal.
We lost a seat on a bus today.
It is white plastic, with a handle and fits a stroller.
Oh, and there was a baby in there.
He wants to talk to you again.

Hello.
I'm sorry I'm a little late.
Ah - Whoa!
Many late.
Let me start with, uh, introducing myself, I'm Professor Geller.
So, to summarize, I'm Professor Geller.
Good job today.

Good evening sir.
My name is Ross Geller.
I am one of the people who applied for the apartment.
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry.
I can not help but notice that you are naked and I applaud you.
Dude, I'd like to be naked.
I mean, it looks so great.
That's how God wanted it.

Okay, I have to tell you something that I never admitted during all our friendship!
But when we were in high school, I went out with James Farrell even when I knew you loved him!
Wow, it's so nice to empty my chest!
Ok, you go there!
My turn? What are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know for you and Chandler.
What?!
I heard you on the phone the other day and you said, "I'm just going to tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a few hours."
And he said, "Laundry?
is
Well. Looks like you're writing a little game yourself, Rach. Wow! Let me know how it turns out.
Well, I would not know because I got so freaked out that I hung up.
Well, if you had continued to listen, you would have heard me call him Mr. Big ot.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He says the most
Okay. So you tell me there's nothing between you and Chandler.
Chandler and me ?!

I really thought you were making a good point. I mean, you know, until you're cut.
Yeah, what's up with this girl Monica?
I do not know! I did not come with her!
Very good everyone! Everyone guesses what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
An exam?!!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yes! We should have some questions for development !!

Ok, I have one for you, if you also had which one would you prefer to eat, a guide dog or a gorilla that speaks?
I would have to say the gorilla who speaks, because at least I can explain to him that you make me eat.
Someone went to college. Sensational. What is it? I am sorry.
Ok, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay on the spot.
I think it's better sir.
But we really have to find someone here.
The work begins to accumulate.
I have a stack of documents on my desk so high.
You know what you should do, just throw them in the shed and pretend you never have them.
It's a good one.
What a guy has to

Yes, everyone is here. Hello everyone, say hello to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi julie
Is there not a national football league?
Yes. Yes, they play on Sunday and Monday nights.
Oh shoot! I work on Monday night.
Umm, this joke is amazing. Do you think we should bring them?
When they are hungry enough, they will enter.

Hey Joey, did you want to talk to me?
I do not know. Do you have something for me?
Oh, it's Rachel.
Ten. Okay. Now, Tag, there are too many women.
Really?
Yes for you!

Oh, Danielle! I did not expect the machine ... Call me when you get the chance. Bye. Oh my God!
It is
Hey, I've done it!
What was there with the dishes?
Oh, uh ..
I want her to think that I could be in a restaurant .. you know?
I could have a kind of life, as if I had not sat here perfecting these last hours.
Look look! He does it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh my God! Go away! Stop watching here!
Great, now he waved his hand.
Dude, we have to do something about this guy.
This morning, I caught him staring into our apartment.
That scares me!
I feel that I can not do things!
What kind of things?
Grow up you? I do not talk about sexy things, but when I cook myself.
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal ... nothing splashes.
What are you looking at me? I did not know that.

You know they say that a monitored pot never beeps.
It's been just a few hours, and she did not call. Not that I care, you know.
Phoebe, why do not you call him? You obviously want.
You think you know me so well.
Well, you do not want?
Yeah.
Ok, well I know you.
That's what I said.
Well then?
I can not
I can not
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was "OK, goodbye Pheebs".
You know what's sad, when we play together, it's like the most fun I've ever had, like all my life.

Okay, bye. Monica will not come, it will be just me and Rachel.
Oh. Keep camper, are you sure you thought about this thing?
It's a laundry. The reflection is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just you two? It's a date. You are going to a date.
Nuh uh.
Yuh-huh.
So what are you saying here? I should shave again, get some wine, what?
Well, you might want to rethink dirty underwear.
It's basically the first time she's going to see your underwear - do you want it to be dirty?
No.
Oh, and uh, the softener?
Ok, ok, now what's wrong with my
Here.

Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
It is the rule.
Which rule? There is no rule, if you have a table!
How did you get to that?
Well, I think the furniture was good until your little adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Did you know about it?
Well, let's just say that the impressions you made in the butter left little imagination.
Ok, ok, if we shared it?
What do you mean, for example, buy it together?
Yeah
Do you think we are ready for something like this?
Why not?
Well, it's a very big commitment, I mean, what happens if one of us wants to leave?
Why are you moving?
I do not move.
You would tell me if you move well
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip ...
Aw, I know everything about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, then he ran away and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, do not do that

Oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Oh no, stay here, we'll continue to do that. I will pay you.
No, I already had trouble for that. I will see you later.
Absolutely. I like the way you kiss.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I am really sorry!
Aw forget that, it comes from
Do you think you can hit my daughter without marrying her ?! I'm going to kill you!!
You know it's not really the right time for me.

Okay! So, we will stay married.
Yes exactly!
And I'll make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Wow! It's so amazing. I really thought I should tell you more about it.
Ok, see now, I'm scared because I do not really think you're joking.
I'm not kidding. Look, I can not have
What then are we going to stay married forever ?!
Ok, look, how are you going to affect you?
Really?
I mean you fill out a form from time to time and instead of ticking the box that says Ms, you check the box that says Mrs.!
His
Oh, all right, I'm sorry.
You are right.
You know what?
We can absolutely stay married, because I felt that the boxes were far
I ask you to do me a favor.
You ask me to be your wife!
And as a woman, I think you should give me that favor.

Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.
I guess I should have understood when she started going to the dentist four to five times a week.
I mean, how clean can the teeth be?
My brother is experiencing that right now, he's really messy. How did you manage to do it?
Well, you could try to accidentally break something precious that is hers, she said -
-leg?
It's a way! I went to get the watch.
You broke his watch?
Ooh, get away from you.
It is true.
Barry, I'm sorry ...
I am really sorry...
I know you probably think that's all I said the other day about the love you wear with your socks, but it's not ... it's not that, it's about me, and I ... Hi, cut to the machine me again ... anyway ...

Not really, honey, it's really good, come with Susan.
Really, no, I think the girls' party is a great idea.
Okay, okay, goodbye
So what are they doing?
I do not know, something little girl.
Hey, you're early.
What are you doing with the lamp?
I just take to be re-wired.
Oh, well, do not take it to the same place you took the stereo, because they have this thing for over a week.
No, no, Mr. Heckles, no one is making noise here.
You disturb my oboe practice.
You do not play oboe!
I could play oboe!
Ohhh! It's so nice!
Okay, listen, I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's so difficult. I mean, I see you walking and I just want to touch you and hold you in my arms.
Okay, that's it! Let her go!
What is going on?
What is going on?! That's what happens !!
Ross!
It's been twenty minutes since I was in your store trying to get a tie!
What should I do to get a service ?!
Hi Rach.

Ross?
Yeah?
Hey it's Mona! Marriage.
Oh hi!
Hi!
Wow! Uh how are you?
I'm fine except you still owe me a dance.
Oh that's right. Well, would you like to see a Ukrainian movie?
Oh you are serious. Sure!
Awesome! Well, um
I think I might need another cup of coffee.
Sure! Uh, let me take it for you.
Okay.

Look, I feel really bad about the way I panicked you before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.
Go!
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
I can play crazy from time to time, but I'm a little more than a pretty blonde girl with a donkey that does not stop.
I think it belongs to your baby's father.
Oh my God Oh, he's here now?
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go and rip the Band-Aid. What do you want to do?
Uh, let's rip!
Really? Are you sure?
Oh Phoebe!
OK sorry. Yeah.
Hi Rachel.

Hey, thank you very much for these notes, Chandler.
Oh well, it was a very important experience for me and I wanted to share it with you.
Oh, you are so wonderful.
Why do not you like me! Chapter One: My First Period
I can not believe you bought this, enjoy your slow death.
I think there are people who have sex.
It can not be me, I'm right here.
Do you want to take a look?
No!
Come on!
You know what? I do not love you without mom. Come on.
We are not stealthily?
Well, I'm sneaking. Oh my God!
Hello sir, you know Monica.

Chandler is fantastic !!
What?!
Oh my God, we just clicked!
Do you know how people click?
As if he had come for me, and I opened the door, and it was like, click!
Did he tell you?
Oh, I ....
Oh, and he has such a good heart! Does not he have a good heart?
Oh, I know ...
Oh, I know and he's so nice! Listen, he said he was going to call, so let him go.
Is not it great ?!
Do not spoil it.

Hi.
Hello Darling!
Hello.
Hi Ross
Yeah, huh.
I have bad news.
What?
I can eat a piece quickly, but then I have to come back here.
Come on darling! You have to work late every night for two weeks, what is it this time?
In fact, it's my fault. I'm leaving today.
But work comes first! Oh, but it's sad for you, what happened? Burnout? Burn everything, huh?
Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
Oh, that's great, so I guess it's ah, it's goodbye then. Huh? Goodbye.
OK then.
Okay.
We will miss you here.
Yeah me too.
So, on Saturday.
Yeah, you bet.

Whazzup ??
Seriously guy, 3 years ago.
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'll be outside today.
Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between Molly and him?
You do not trust him?

I think the recording is like that.
Ahh
Monica copes, Chandler is against marriage. And always will be!
Well, there are people who want to marry me.
There is?
Yeah! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wanted to marry you ?! And - and Chandler tells you how he hates marriage ?!
It is true.
Chandler
You just told me he hates marriage!
That's it's a complex-type that is unlikely to take a woman!
That he is against marriage and will always be!
You have

You know you probably did not know, but in high school I had a big crush on you.
I knew.
You did it! Oh ... I always thought you thought I was Monica's big brother geek.
I did.
Oh.
Listen, do you think - and try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor here - but do you think it would be nice if I asked you out?
One day?
May be?
Yeah maybe ...
Okay ... okay, maybe I'll ...

Why?
Well, I thought it would be good for me to do something good for my friend.
Well, you are amazing.
Oh no-no-no.
A TV as if it came from nowhere! This is the dream! Dude, how can you afford that?
Well, you know, I'm 29 years old. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends of all time.
Oh, I do not know.
Oh no no no no, you are!
You do that, you give me good advice, and listen, I thought about what you said yesterday about focusing on a woman, I'm going to do it
You mean with Casey.
No, no, I think I'll see how things go with Kathy. She is pretty cool.
Or Casey.
No, no, Kathy.
It could be Casey.
No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
Do you know what I think?
I think someone has a little crush on Casey.
How am I going to arrange both?
What do you think?
May all the pieces of my life fall into place!

Hey, does anyone have a rope length about six feet long with a little wee in the end?
Honey, what's the problem?
I just saw Janice.
Because every time I see your face, I can not help falling into disgrace. I know.....
Wow! This girl is good
Oh-ho, yes! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I had never thought of it before.
I like it.
Why? Because she can sing and play the guitar and do both at the same time?
Well, that's about all I'm looking for from these people.
Look at you. All jealous
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you have a completely different style. You know, she's more .. you know, and you're more
next to meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Ok, see, see, everyone is happy it's over.
Okay, my next song is called Phoebe Buffay, what can I say?
I really loved when we sang partners and I should not have left you that way.
Oh no, one of these songs is "looking for the hidden meaning".

Yes hello.
I have a question.
Uh, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Thank you.
No,
What?! What else did he say?
Uh, he said he thought I was funny.
So, all right, look, go down, we'll have fun, and you'll forget everything.
Ross, no! There is
Oh, come on! Rachel, it's not so bad.
Ross, I'm a human scribble !!
Look, it's not because an idiot has drawn on your face that you must not have fun!
Okay?
And by the way, hey-hey, no one is even going
Okay, there was

Come on!
Oh, wait, you do not have to pay for that, busty ladies?
No it's OK. A child asked me to take it for him, but I do not do it
Oh yes? Okay.
Okay.
But! You do not have to give him back his money?
Uh-huh. Hey, here's my friend. Sorry, no porn for you. Ok, let's go see Monica!

Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, do you want to come for a lemonade?
So?!
Whoa, ah! Are we just going to have some lemonade?
Yeah huh !! Cover up!
Oh, okay.
I do not believe it! When someone asks you for lemonade and that means he wants to have sex?
Well usually ... yeah!
Not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just thought you liked me.
I'm stupid.
It's okay. I guess it could happen to anyone, not everyone I know, but ... By the way, I can still see it.

Hmmm ... it's so nice.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as ... rather than a general question ...
OKAY.
OKAY. Here you are. It's been a while since I wanted to, uh ...
Ohhh !!!!
Yes Yes it is true ...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
I did not mean
Why not?
It's brilliant!
Goodbye Mike, see you at the wedding, guys!
well, we will probably not invite you to the wedding ...
Thank you, Chandler.
Cordially.
Well, nothing! Happy to have been able to help.
How do you think I should propose?
David, I'm pretending

Ok, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can not win if you do not ask
What?!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
We've been on the road for six hours and you've been sleeping for five and a half hours!
We go to the next rest stop and
Okay. Okay.
Yeah! And until then, you will sing because the radio is broken and you are selfish but you have a beautiful voice.
Really? I do not
Sing!!
Dude, it's a long journey! Are my eyes open? No!
Morning!

Everything was delicious!
Thank you!
It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Thank you! You did not say anything ...
In fact, I have a little complaint.
Oh, please! I welcome the critics.
The musician right in front of the restaurant ... it's a kind of good mood!
Which musician?

We were doing?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, here's your traditional Thanksgiving feast, your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin and your family-size Funyuns bag.
Wait, wait, Chandler, that's what you want for Thanksgiving dinner?
What, what, what's with you and these holidays?
Okay, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
We have just finished this wonderful Thanksgiving dinner.
I have - and I remember it very well - a sip of pumpkin pie, and that's when my parents choose to tell me they're going to divorce.
Oh my God.
Yes. It's very difficult to enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it upside down.

Hey, who is this little naked guy?
This little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yes, yes, it's my penis. Can we be adults now?
Who are these people?
Had me.
Oh, it's Nana, right in the middle. "Me and the gang at Java Joe's".
Wow, Monica, you look like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Let's see, 1939 ... yes, 24, 25?
It looks like a funny gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! Monica is naked!
No, it would be me again. I am trying something.

So what is it?
Rachel has something she wants to tell you and um, I think it's your red sweater.
No, it's my red sweater.
Oh no. Can I give someone a coffee or a poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
What's going on Rach?
Nothing! Phoebe was a little mistaken. But you know that you wear this sweater often, are you involved in a kind of challenge?
You know, I'm really glad Phoebe called.
I know we broke up because you thought I was not mature enough, but I really grew up and I think we should get back together.
Oh, it's just not the right time.
It is the right time.
Okay.
'Kay!
in the Favorite Return Character category, the nominees are: John Wheeler of
What is it?

Yeah.
You are an Aquarius, huh?
I bet you are a Gemini.
Nope.
Taurus?
Nope.
Virgin?
Nope.
Sagittarius?
Yes.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh.
Well I tell you what
Yeah?
You're not going to accelerate anymore, right?
I will not speed up.
And you promise that you'll take care of it right away?
I promise.
And in the meantime, you'd better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Yeah!
Can he handle the stick?
never mind
I can handle the stick !!

Hey!
Hey!
Hi.
Oh hi.
I can not believe it takes so long. How are you?
Oh, not bad. Do you know this feeling when you are trying to blow up a St. Bernard?
The weirdest thing. Have I heard - Mother of God, that's right!
Chandler Bing!
Jan-Janice!
Not just Janice, Janice in work, outsourcing and everything.
Oh, it should be easy. I have a very large pool. You remember Chandler.
Janice I did not even know you were pregnant! Who is the involuntary man who is the essence that you stole?
It's you. This is yours.
What?!
Look how nervous he is! We have not slept together for years!
Now that's funny. Does it hurt? Does the job hurt?

Dude, I'm starving! What did I think about dinner ?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
You know, you know, I look and I do not think anyone is at home here.
I say we just broke the window, crawling through, and-and you know how to explain later.
Yeah? Really? Nobody is at home?
I do not think so. Hello? When you enter

Hey whats up?
I just saw Danny take the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, everything is your fault! You got involved in our relationship !!
You do not have a relationship !!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going as planned!
Oh my God, stop with the plan!
So what, then what did you see with a girl?
We do not care?!
It does not mean anything!
Now, look, you're going out with Danny and you're going to be so charming that he's going to forget the stupid subway girl.
She was a little stupid.
You are right.
Okay, I'll just go on the date.
I will go on the date.
This is the new plan.
Come on hurry up!

Hi.
Phoebe!
Ta-da.
Hey.
Hi.
Ahh, look at you, you are beautiful.
Do I? Thanks you too.
Thank you.
Sparkling.
So, wow, it's pretty futile, huh.
Mr. Major Capades.
I remember when you were King King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
You always said that I would do it.
Yeah, well, you know, I'm a little scary like that. Wooo.
I missed you. I'm going to change.
OKAY.
Uh, now. Phoebs.
Oh, all right, all right. Ole.
What?
Uh, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.

Hi Joey, this is Jane Rogers, I can not wait for your party tonight.
Listen, I forgot your address, can you call me?
Thank you, hello.
Hey!
Hey!
What is happening'?
Yeah, it's a shame that you can not attend this one-woman show tonight.
Oh, I'd love to, but I have to get up so early the next day and then, you know me, work first
Oh yes, yes, yes ...
"Hi Joey, this is Jane Rogers looking forward to your party tonight"
Stupid Jane Rogers !!
You have a party tonight ??
A little ... something for the people of Days Of Our Life.
And you were not going to tell us? How did you think you were going to get by?
I do it every year.
Do you do this every year ??
I did not have to tell you that !! I am dumber than Jane Rogers !!
Oh, that's why you got these tickets for this room, to get rid of us?
Yeah...
And last year, is that why you sent us to this medieval restaurant?
Yeah...
OH! And the year before, when did you organize this nocturnal tour of this button factory?

Who is it?
Oh, it's Ross.
Oh ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Recalled what?
It was like months ago.
We passed by this antique store and I saw this pin at the window and told him that it was as if my grandmother had one when I was a little girl.
Oh!
I can not believe he remembered it!
Oh, it's so pretty. It must have cost him a fortune.
I can not believe he did that.
Come on, Ross? Do you remember in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought him that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
F-hah .... Flennin ....
Oh my God.

I really like to wake up with you.
I like to wake up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
That would be great!
We could have breakfast in bed
Wait, just a second.
Okay. Oh! Oh no.

It was depressing, I think I just bought a pretzel from one of the children of
Um-hmm. Oh, wait! It's Bonnie.
Hi!
Is it Bonnie? Is it Bonnie? Are you Bonnie?
Can I show you an ID if you want?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you're very different from the last time I saw you.
Oh yes, well, I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.
Well, I hope you'll have fun tonight.
Thank you! You too.
I believe him.
No you do not do it.
Yes.
No, you know what, you're not going to make me suck.
Oh, of course, because you always have to be right.
I do not always have to agree, okay.
Jurassic Park

I tell you something is wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the garbage chute.
Ross could not get into the chute.
That's right, he could almost. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Hey!
Here it is!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been? !!
Just, you know how to go out.
Oh, outside, oh my God, I do not know why we did not think to check there!
What were you doing?
I went to a bar. And then I just uh, I just walked for a while.
Did you walk all night in the city on your own?
He plugged in! He met someone.
Look, I do not have to answer your questions! Okay? I am a big boy, I can do what I want!
He plugged in !! Tell us about her!
Ross, you left your scarf in Hey, guys.

Okay.
Oh yes, it looks good.
You make a
Yes, we are beautiful together.
Yes we
Okay.
Wow! Imagine what our children could look like!
You know, we do not have to imagine.
I marry her.
We will just see.

Hey! Hey! Watch out for my Porsche!
Hi Joey.
Hey! How are you'?
He has the most incredible Porsche under there!
I'd love to show you, but I just hid it.
She sleeps.
Hey, would you like a drink, two girls?

Well, the old lady is dead.
And how do I know?
His last wish was a last kiss.
But I do not care, because you have the apartment.
Yes!
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I will stay here.
Is not it great?
Ezels !!

Smelly, smelly cat, what do they feed you? Smelly cat, smelly, it's not your fault.
Wow this is great.
Oh yes!
You know you could totally sell that. It would be perfect for a campaign like Kumy.
I ..., a jingle? No no no no no.
What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Ok, well, if I was in the loop for the money, I would be a millionaire already, you know.
You just have to get out of this nice head.
Aw, you're right, you're right. I am sorry.
Its good. Okay, I'm going to play a really sad song. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.

Ok sir, um-mm, let's see if I understood correctly.
Ah, so it's a half-coffee, double height, easy hazelnut, no fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot milk coffee, no?
Okay! Great.
You panic.
Thank you.
Uh, coffee to go, please.
Isabella Rosselini.
Are you serious? Oh my God.
Heck! I can not believe I removed it from my list.
Why? Because if you do not go there?
Yeah maybe.
Oh-oh, you're lying.
What do not you think I would go to her?
Ross, you took ten years to admit that you liked me.
Yeah, mademoiselle, you'd better be happy that this list is plasticized.
You know what darling, go ahead, we'll call her a substitute.
Ok, hold my robot.
Okay.
Rachel, are you really going to let him do that?
Honey, he's about to go after Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we do not have popcorn.
Ok, that's enough.
'....
Do not you want to dance with me?
A-ha !!!

Oh-oh-oh, yes! That's right, you take good care of these babies!
Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!
I know you?
Joey!
Oh-ho, yeah. Yes, the guy's hand.
Ok, that's right.
Okay.
Well!
Choose one.
Left! Thank you.
You are welcome.
Ross!
Joey! We should simply change.
Yes absolutely!
Yeah.

Rachel, we're sorry for pushing these guys on you.
Oh that's good!
You know, I had a great time.
You know, the charity was a great success and they raised a lot of money and sensitized.
So what was it for?
I mean an illness.
Hey!
Hey!
I just got this really strange Ross message. He said turn on
Huh. Okay.
Oh my God, look! It's Elisabeth!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Ahh, to be 13 years old again.
Yeah.

Hey! So, uh, was he excited about the tickets?
No! He cut our breath!
What?!
I know!
I can not believe. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
You know what? He did not want to talk about anger, well maybe we do not talk to him
Ooooh! Freeze it.
It is true!
I love it!
Door handle?
Yeah, it pushes a little on you. In fact, I wanted to finish talking to you about spring break.
Oh good.
Look, I'm watching, I'm having a good time with you and I just do not want to go too fast or have a lot of pressure
So, I'm sorry, I just do not think we should leave together again
It's too early.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I said. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a few weeks.
No, I think you misunderstood what
You are so adorable.
This! Let's talk about that.

Hey!
How do you feel?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Okay, so I
And protected them from a tornado?
Oh my God.
I know, babies are asleep.
Phoebe, what, what happened here ?!
I did it! I took care of babies alone!
But my apartment!
Was the setting for Phoebe's triumph.
But the bazaar!
Is not that as important as the fact that Phoebe looked after the babies all by herself.
You're right, you're right, I should not panic.
Because that's what will happen when you and I have babies!
When will it happen?
!
Phoebe, would you like to take a look at this mess !!!!

Hey!
Hey Ross! The baby kicks!
What?! It is?!
It's not a kick right now. Although we would like to see you again.
Hey, when-when did it work? What happened?
Last night! I just felt it and I went to Joey's room and he was sleeping
A sleep without dreams.

So come on, guys, tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is always that you throw Barry to the altar!
Well. Let's talk about reality for a second.
Okay.
When do you come home?
What? Guys, I'm not.
Come on, it's us.
I'm not! That's what I'm doing now. I have this job-
Waitress?
Ok, I'm not just a waitress.
I am..
I, uh ...
I write promotions on the promotions board, and, uh ... and me, uh ...
I take out the dead flowers of the vase ... Oh, and sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate biscuits on the biscuits.

We go down around midnight, why not pick you up then?
So, will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring.
Oh my God.
You see, cleaning works!
They are nice.
Oh, they are firefighters.

Your son.
No no no. I do not have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie's house.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
J? I understood.
J? I understood.
J? have understood! Hey, you sleep with her, I have cramps.
No, you do not do it.
Okay, that's it. I want you both out.
Why?
He started it!
No, you started it.
You did it!
I do not care. I'm trying to get someone out of my body here, and you're not making things easy.
But...
Go ahead!
Thank you so much.
See what you did.
Yeah, listen ...
Outside

Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Do you want to sleep with me tonight? Why? What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such a good service at the Maurice café.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hello.
Uh, could you please tell Sergei that uh, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in The New York Times.
You did not say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering ...
Okay, ah, before you get all your talk, um, could you also tell Sergei that I really like his costume.
Hey, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you're very pretty tonight, your hair golden like the sun.
So you are a chef?
I am also thinking of opening my own restaurant.
Oh really.
Monica, I can talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
Well, I had a conversation.
Yes, but Mischa is so interested in you that Sergei and I could not say two words.
What do you want me to do? Sit in silence while you have a conversation?
That would be great. Thank you.

then we finally arrive at the top of the mountain and airhead forgets the camera here!
Oh, you know the same thing happened to me once.
When did this happen to you ?!
Do not you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw this beautiful bird and we wanted to take a picture, I did not have my camera!
Oh yes. First of all, chasing Churo's guy does not jog.
Oh, it's so good you have to try it.
Oh fuck! I got it on my pants.
Here, I'm going to get it.
We'd better take off those pants at the top or that task will be fixed.
Yes. I will take them to our meeting tonight.
Oh great!
Okay goodbye! Oh my God!!
It was amazing!
Okay, see? I told you!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
I do not think they are brother and sister.
They are brother and sister !!!

Action!
I found the picture!
What picture?!
The picture of my wife! In your bag!
You crossed my personal property?
Why a picture of Paulette in your bag ?!
Because Vincent, we were in love. During two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yeah?
Oh you are awesome! And in this last speech? You soaked me.
Thank you so much.
Here is your call sheet for tomorrow.
I know.

So, Chandler, your parents must have been delighted when you told them you were engaged.
Oh yes, I should probably call them.
I remember when we got engaged.
Oh, I do not think I've ever heard this story.
Oh dad, you really do not need to
Well, I put Judy pregnant. I still do not know how it happened.
You do not know how it happened ?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a beautiful story.
Well, at least you do not hear it for the first time at your fifth-grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Anyway, we are very excited about our wedding plans and I think very soon we will make a big withdrawal from Monica's wedding fund.
What?
You tell him Jack, I can not do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund, do not you?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.

After applying the strips of wax and linen on the number one leg,
Do it!
Grab one of the flax strips with its easy-to-grasp tab and pull it out quickly and painlessly.
Okay. Ow !!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was not it painless?
No, it was painful. Oh my God, they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Uh, well, satin girls do not seem to think that's so bad.
It's because their nerves are probably dead with stupidity.
But hey, you know, if you do not believe me, by my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Are you glad we did not start with the bikini bands?

Now, remember that you have to imagine me in a kilt.
I can imagine you in a plaid skirt and short socks.
Do you want to start telling secrets?
No!
Now, remember that I'm still learning.
One two three four!
You know the song! Sung!
So?
No!

Oh my God! It's David!
David who?
David the scientist, David whom I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Oh my God!
Oh, you say someone's name is enough, they turn around.
Phoebe?
David! What are you doing here? Are not you supposed to be in Russia?
Yeah, I'm right, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm,
Well yeah. You are beautiful too. Did you have a haircut?
Yeah. Well, I have like thirty.
Yeah.
Yes! Santa Claus is coming!

Hey, uh, I'm really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
It's not a big deal. Hey, you know, you do what you have to do. Right?
But hey, it's not just me, I'm talking about scientists and tour guides
It does not matter.
It's like that everywhere, Joey!
Ok, Mono, support me here.
Where do you work, servers eat with servers, right?
And the chefs are eating with the other chefs, right?
I eat alone in the alley because everyone hates me.
Listen, Ross, really, it does not matter.
You're wearing a white coat, I'm wearing a blue blazer, if that means we can not be friends at work, so be it.
You know, hey I understand.
You know?
Hey, when I play in a room and you're in the audience, I'm not talking to you, are you?
So it's you, it's cool.
I will see you tomorrow.
Yes, when we are in the audience, he does not speak to us, but he signals.

You looked like an idiot.
Hey, I was not the only one to look like an idiot.
Okay?
Do you remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"
And he came out, "Buat Squatternut?"
Yes it's the same.
That's all. It's my worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, wait! It's not the one Rachel is talking about. She did not even know it had happened. So what was it?
Which?
Umm, I-I really do not want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, relive the pain and be depressed, that's what Thanksgiving is all about.
You know, for me anyway.
And of course, the Indians.
Look, uh, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!

Hi guys.
Hi! Phoebe
Hi Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologize if I-you know seemed a little upset yesterday at my shower. You know it's just hormones, you know.
No U.S
Hormones.
hormones, yes.
Your parents'?
Yes, they are out of town.
Ohh
Yeah yeah that's it
Yes it works.
They-they-they can feel the fear.

Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Honey, do you remember my boss, Doug, do you?
Yes hello
Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this MA
I did not know you and Carol had just got divorced, I'm sorry.
Sorry? Finally chew my leg out of this bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
No leg pain for us sir.
Oh, give the time.
So, divorce, marriage, we have a lot to celebrate.
What if we went out for dinner tomorrow night?
I can not think of anything we do. Why can not I think of anything we do?
Tomorrow night, then, I should be out of court at six o'clock.
They keep throwing me these cases of sexual harassment and I get them out of the park!
Okay, see you tomorrow!
Just so you know, we will not see him tomorrow.
I-I can not spend another night with this man.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
No.
This is because he was not invited because of the way he behaved during our engagement party.
Oh yes. Boy cuts urine

Now, maybe you want all the duck to be here! Who cares, you know? Now I have legs
How many times have I told you guys, you
Hi Chandler.
Hey!
Uh, listen, I need the dripping pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Oh, it was yours? Uh, yes, we used it when the duck vomited caterpillars.
William Sonoma
Expect that in 4-6 weeks.
Uh, uh, uh, Joey will be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have plenty of room for us alone.
Yes so?
Well, I thought you might want to spend time with the best you've ever had.
You know what, champion? I think I will pass.
Why?
Why?
What are you talking about?

So, what's your name?
It's Jake.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Yes, big fan.
Me too! There is a match on Tuesday, do you want to go?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.

Ugh. Ross!
Hi! Please excuse my delay. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo !!
Oh great!
Look, I had to find you a new battery.
I got you the best I could, because that's not where you want to skimp.
You're a genius, Ross.
Yeah, well, it cost about $ 112, but damn it, just 110 pairs?
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay goodbye !!
So, ah, they all took off, it was hard enough to watch them go, see?
Yeah, all right, goodbye.
So I will leave then!

Hey! Oh yes, tonight was your party.
Oh wow, you are beautiful! Glad you can do it.
Oh, you know, the gala had to end now and then.
Do not go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yes of course. Okay, what pitch is the ball now?
I thought there was no bullet?
Oh, come on! He's glad I came, he does not want me anywhere, bullets flying everywhere!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom.
Oh, keep going! Do you talk to me about people?
You two could really hear you! I will mingle.
So you work at
Yeah, all right, feel good about it!
I am sorry?
No, everything is fine, you can just drop the Tommy act.
I know what's going on here.
The winger of your Danny is not it?
You are the best buds.
Frat bros!
I will talk to a friend.
Yeah, yeah, you're going to talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Man! He does not stop lobing them and I can not stop knocking them out of the park!
I think I need a drink.
Yeah!

Hey, Pheebs?
No, I can not talk to you! I do not have an ad in the yellow pages!
Look, Pheebs, I just want to apologize for saying that your method was stupid and maybe ask you to become my teacher again.
And-and I promise you I will not touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
Do you really think I'm ready?
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!
Was the rope at least fair
No!

Well, it has been fun.
Yes. Yes, thank you for letting me use your phone ... and save my life.
Goodbye Chandler. I had a big blackout. See you.
Hi, I'm the number 7143457.
And, uh, I do not know if you have anything, but I'd really like a copy of the tape.

We are starting to see a lot of layers of fabrics and colors. For example, a navy blouse on a rose ....
I'm really glad we came. You are so cute. I love you.
Ok, it's a fire. Oh yes. Oh yes.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'll have to remind you, I have a Schemp in my office.
What are you doing?
I am sorry.
But uh, hey, oh, someone hung up on the phone. Why a glass of wine by the fire, I could turn it on again.
Ross, you do not listen to me, I do not have time to stop.
Come on Rachel, you do not have what, ten minutes?
I do not have ten minutes !!
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross !!! I told you no!
Do not scream at me, it's the maximum I've seen you all week.
Look, I can not do that now, okay, I have a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Yes, but wait ...
Goodbye!
In fact, it's our three-hole punch.

Oh yes? When?
Okay.
I will tell you what.
When we are 40, if neither of us are married, what do you say, you and I, we meet and have one?
Why will not I be married when I'm 40?
Oh no no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why will not I be married at 40?
No no no.
What is it? Is there anything fundamentally implausible about me?
uh
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a backpack!
Hey.
Hey. Ooh, look at yourself, dressed.
Have you gone home and changed?
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I want to look good. Uh, has Dr. Franzblau gone?
No I have not seen it.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. And if the baby needs him?
Rachel, what's going on between you and the doctors? Was your father a doctor?
Yeah why?
Without reason.

I am the armadillo of the holidays! I am a friend of Santa Claus and he sent me here to wish you a merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Okay, I'll do it just this time! But you can not tell anyone!
Yes! Yes! Please, give it to me!
Yes it's her.
Thank you.
It's incredible! I can not believe this panel did not work!
Do you know what would work?
Hmm?
Stop making sweets!
But they like that!
You mean they love you.
May be.
Is that why you became a chef? For people to love you?
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to love you, huh, funny man?

We were on the platform, ready to dance the world in the new millennium, and the guy shouted "CUT!
Uh, wait, so you tell me you've been doing the routine since eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course, we had to update it a bit. Hey, by the way, it's great to think of catching me!
'Because I was going to say there was no way to make the end as you did at the time!
What? We could do it!
I do not know, I mean you were much bigger, I mean, stronger at the time.
I can do it, okay? Let's go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can not do it!
Now you do that, you're on TV.

Hey!
So, what are you on the market for? We have scarves, postcards of tulips ...
Look at this? Huh? Yeah. That's the thing. What do you think?
Well, I do not have to buy that anymore, a "I'm stupid" t-shirt.
Well, I like that. Here you are.
Well, listen, you're not really going to buy what you are? Do not you think you embarrassed me enough for a day?
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer that when I pretend not to know you?
He is just jealous. You will adapt well; all Londoners wear them!
Oh really? So how come nobody here wears them?
They are all tourists.
Look, if you want to wear this in public, you'll spend the rest of the afternoon.
Oh yes? If you want me to choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Good choice.
Thank you.
OK wait. Okay, that's all, okay, I'm getting out of here. I will not be embarrassed anymore!

So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What?
You know, I do not read as many important books as you do, and I do not write complicated poems that seem to concern one thing but actually concern something else.
And you know what, I'm excited about stupid things, like when I
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You do not even know me ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem does not concern you.
What?
The empty vase does not concern you. My baby, you make me so sad that you think that.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe ...
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Oh yes.

Ok, forward. Forward-Stop! Ok, back-stop! Ok, advance-stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross, forget that. This guy totally stuck you.
Is this yours?
Well actually
No no no! It's mine! It's mine.
Dude, you need this car so badly.
Okay.
Ok, here's what we will do.
Ok, I'll break into this minivan and put it in neutral.
You're pushing guys so Ross can leave.
Okay?
Okay, let's go.
Carry the ass !!!
!

Thus, it was said that by 2030 there would be computers capable of performing the same number of functions as a real human brain.
So, theoretically, we could download our thoughts and memories into this computer ...
... and live forever as a machine!
So it's Janine, do you know-what-you know we're doing now?
You and I interfere.
Yes, I have to go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!

David, can you help me ?! I try to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Oh, definitely. It is a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
See?
Yeah, it comes down to "it has something to do with the wind".
Well, I'll go get some stuff for the trip.
Oh, I should go too.
Oh, now ... tomorrow, do you want to share a taxi for the airport or if Mike and I meet there?
Oh ... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he'll be there.
And she was like, "Oh, do not worry!
I asked him.
He totally agrees to see you! ".
So now, I have to go, so he'll think I totally agree to see him!
What you are not, because you have totally hung up!
Exactly!
And you want him to eat his heart so that you have to have a fabulous look!
I did not even think about that! Aaargh,
Hey Pheebs, I'm going to take Charlie to the shops, why do not you come and I'll help you find something.
Ok, it'll be great!
Oh, that's not nice? You three, try slutty lingerie together.
This is not what we are going to do!
Why would you ruin him, who was this wounded?

Julie hello! Chandler Bing, I guess you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.
It's a nickname, I'll explain to you later.
It's pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long-awaited apology. I should never have broken up with you because you were overweight.
That's why you broke up with me?
You do not know it. Well, I guess my job here is over!

Ni-chou chi-ma!
Ross! Excuse me, forgive me, excuse me ...
Hi everybody.
I just wanted to thank you for our discussion before.
Oh, my God, no problem. So are you going to go with the wait?
I was fine, but after talking to you, I talked to Joey.
What did he say?
Basically, he told me to overtake and do it, you know.
So, I thought about what you said and what he said and, well, his way of making love tonight.
.
.

Oh great!
You could not forget your eyes all night, then from time to time he would bend down to stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Ok, stop Phoebe, you make me all sparkle.
All I could think of was, "Will he kiss me, will he kiss me?"
And did he do it?
I am a woman Monica, I do not kiss and do not tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay, okay, I have it. J? I understood.
I love him so much that I feel that I have drunk 10 glasses today and that I have only taken six.
Oh, I have not had that feeling since I started dating Chandler.
Wow, I'll never have that feeling again, will I?
You talk like a guy.
No, a guy would say, "I will never sleep with anyone else."
Oh my God!
I will never sleep with anyone else!
I was so busy planning the wedding that I forgot all the things I would give up!
I mean, I will never have a first kiss again.
You'll have a last kiss.

Thank you very much for coming back.
Oh, you're here. Yes, and I was afraid it would be uncomfortable.
I know Mona, listen to me.
First of all, I'm really sorry that my father is screaming at you, but I heard you hold on.
You'll have to tell me how you did that.
Focus.
Okay. Uh, but ok, yes, Ross and I had a date with someone. And yes, we are going to have a baby. But we are
Okay, where is this turkey!
Joey! These are my maternity pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!

No.
No!
Yes!
Ahh
Oh, are you watching this Monica?
I just shoot down all your best scores, what sadness.
Ok, I'm next. Do not! Do not start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
Oh I am sorry. I did not hear about all the winners.
Chandler! Phoebe takes over the game!
Remember that I had to leave the room the other day when you had this roast chicken?
Yeah. But I thought it was because I had put everything on my hand and had it crossed the table.
Anyway, it does not seem worth it to make a whole turkey for only three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
But you must have turkey for Thanksgiving!
I mean, Thanksgiving without a turkey is like July 4th without apple pie!
Or Friday without two pizzas!
Everything is fine! If it matters a lot to you! But just, there will remain a ton.
No, there will not be any! I promise that I will finish this turkey!
Okay, you tell me you can eat a whole turkey in one sitting?
It is true!
Because I am a Tribbiani!
And that's what we do!
I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we do not read a lot or do not run very fast, but damn it!
We can eat!

Well?
Wow! It's enormous! It's so much bigger than the cabin. Oh, it's a cube.
Look at this!
Oh! You have a window!
Yes really! With a beautiful view of ...
Oh look! This guy pee!
Hi.
Hi.

You know what? I can not do that with my left hand! Could you please, help me with that too?
Ohh
Okay. Let's use this brush.
Okay. This kind of things?
Yeah.
Okay.
Careful. Light. Ok, do you know how, just sweep the lid. Okay? Just sweep.
Oke-Dokey.

Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, technically, it's not a zoo as such, but rather an interactive wildlife experience.
Let me ask you some questions about, is it Marcel?
Yes.
Does he fight with other animals?
No, no, he is very docile.
Even if he was ... stuck?
Well, I do not know. Why?
Uh, how does he handle small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's what it means ...
How about a hammer or a small blade?
Why, why, why would he need a blade?
Well, if he's against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you have to give something to the little guy.
Otherwise it's just cruel.
He came in, he went to San Diego.
We came back from our walk and the phone was ringing ...
...He is in.
He is in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You make a big mistake here.
I mean, San Diego is fine, but if you give it to me, I will start it against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the winnings.

My sample is in the room and I just want to thank anyone who knocked on the door while I was there.
Really helped speed up the process!
Janice!
You're not ... gone?
Oh!
Sid is still in his room.
I do not allow porn at home, so it's like a vacation for him.
So did you do it?
Have you made your deposit?
Yeah! yes ... the hard part is over!
This is not the difficult part darling! The hard part is what comes next, I mean, are not you worried about the results?
I have not ... I have not even thought about the results yet ... I just assumed everything would be fine.
Oh! Well, what do you know? It probably is.
Phoebe, where's your bag?
No no! Give it to me!
You can not have it.
Give it to me!
No
I'll go.
Oh yes.
Phoebe come here
Haha!
Damn, Monica Geller, hyphen Bing!

What we did was wrong. Oh my god, I slept with someone who was not alive during the bicentennial.
I just made love.
Ethan, concentrate. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, it's different. My lie did not make one of us a criminal in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I did not think. I was too busy falling ...
Do not say it.
...in love with you.
Really?
Sorry.
Well, forget it.
You know, you should not even be here, it's a school night.
Oh my god, oh my god.
I am like those women you see with bright guys named Chad.
I am Joan Collins.
Who?

That's right, still no baby! Come on! Please make room!
Uh darling, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
You. As if you did not have enough.
Listen, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish I could do something.
I mean I would like to be a hippocampus.
Because with seahorses, it is the male who carries the babies.
And then too, I would be far in the sea.
God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life!
Oh I know, I went there. I remember towards the end
Oh Phoebe, it's a beautiful story.
Can you tell me when you get me iced tea?
Oh my God, come out!
Get out !!
Get out !!
Get out!
!
Let's

Okay, I know! I know. Yeah, it's okay.
Oh my God. What will he do now?
I can not watch!
Oh.
Seriously, how can you look at this?
Are not you afraid?
terrified

Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Um, listen, there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is it you who goes out with the nurse?
Yes, Joey already told me so, and I'm fine.
I mean, you and I are just, you know, we are nothing, we go everywhere.
Uh, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out, but hey, if we laugh, uh, maybe I
Well! Maybe I'll do it too!
Well, it was big enough. I-I-I-I-I-I-I had to throw away most of it.
You, you have thrown my sandwich!
MY SANDWICH? !!!
MY SANDWICH !!!!!!

What's the problem, Pheebs?
She canceled! My namesake canceled on me!
What?!
Yes, she said she had to get out of the city suddenly.
She avoids me, she does not want to tell me where my father is.
She knows and she will not tell me anything.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, well, is not that 'Aww Pheebs, that sucks!' me again.
Where are you going?
Well, she's out of town so there must be something in her house that tells me where my father is.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call it breaking in.
Well, are there people here ?!
Oh my God, me too!
I knew it, wow!
Wait, wait, wait! Cute or ugly puppies?
Oh, so cute.
Uh-huh, well! But uh, I'm still ... I'm mad at you.
I know. I am angry at myself too.
Do you want to eat something? I'm a little hungry.
Hey! Me too!
Okay, stop that. Now, you're just doing it to scare me.

Ok, you can do that.
It's like removing a bandage.
Do it very quickly and the wound will be exposed.
Janice Hi Janice. OK, let's go. I do not think we should go out anymore. Janice
Okay. Well, there it is. Stop, stop, stop.

Oh my God! This guy at the counter is totally watching you!
Really? God, he's really cute.
Dark.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
I'm just saying, get his number just in case.
But no: Chandler is in an accident and can not play sexually and he wants you to take a lover to satisfy the needs he can no longer satisfy
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but hum, I'm engaged.
Well, you should be embarrassed.
I did it, but it was really fun.

Hey.
Chandler. I felt it was you.
What?!
Unagi. I am always aware.
OK, do you know that unagi is an eel?
What's up?
I do not know what to do Monica.
Oh, why do not you give him one of your little jokes.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have something here that looks homemade?
You know what?
She would love that.
Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I did it in sixth grade.
Yes, I guess I could use it. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yeah-yeah, except that Apollo 8 did not land on the moon.
But you, you could write that, uh, your love allows me to twirl around the moon and come back safely.
Wait a minute, I can not give it to him.
Why not?
Because it is written "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Yeah, more.
Hey, thank you very much.
Sensational. Well, I guess it's Cupid who brought her here.
No, just an old flying dwarf.

Oh. Oh, I can not believe Clark supports me!
He could still appear.
Oh, what are you stupid? It's been three hours.
Is that all?
I should just move on to happier things, okay? Why do not you talk about your beautiful marriage?
In fact, there was something we wanted to tell you about marriage.
Uh, it's going to be a small ceremony.
Uh, tiny!
We do not even know why we have it.
In fact, it will only be family.
Oh, wait, do you take me for a family? Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing

Come to me. No-no, you come here for me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, did you bring Joey?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Whoa! What do you know Katie? I must tell you that I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Oh, Joey has the best friends!
Ohh, and the sweetest girlfriend!
You are so nice!
Oh, you are so nice!
Oww !!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.
Well? Are not you going to do something?
uh
You better do something, or I'll go out the door now! Well? Will you?
Nah.

How can you take a hitchhiker ?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
You do not think I asked him that before he came in ?!
You know what? I do not speak to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist ?!
No!
Do you like car games?
Yeah, do you know the license plate game?
I
Ooh, I will play! I will play!
No no! You need your sleep. Night night! Hush!

Pheebs, can you help me choose an engagement ring for Monica?
I can not understand that!
It is so hard!
Should I get her a Tiffany Cup or a Princess Cup or a-ah-ah!
Paper cut!
Now, did you tell anyone else?
No, I do not want to talk to anyone because I do not want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends and you surprised me when I was looking at brochures.
Yeah, again, do not knock is profitable. I only wish you were not in the bathroom.
Me too.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! So Chandler, do you want to go to the cafe?
Ah. Very good.
Yes, a coffee.
Oh, perfect, we were going to see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, we do not do it because we got the other pl place.
So vulgar.
Oh I am sorry. Do you want to bite?

The stripper stole the ring !! The stripper stole the ring !! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What?
The ring is gone!
Ugh.
Just a second, give me a minute to get up for that-ah-ha-ha !!
You lost the ring!
You are the worst man of all time!
Dude, it's not funny!
What will I do?!
I'm going to bed last night, everything is cool!
I wake up this morning, the stripper is gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
Of course!!

What difference does it make?
Well, I'm right-if the dough matches the pants, you can make some pants and it will not know the difference!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I going
Uh, Rachel is here, so good luck, let me know how it goes.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, your timing could not be better. I extinguish fires everywhere.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
What is it, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise not to tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I do not want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you want to know! It's incredible!
I do not care, Rachel! Look, I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can not tell anyone!
What? What secrets? Do you know secrets? What are they?
And you are not supposed to chat !!
I know I know! I just can not keep this one, so I pick up the phone
I'm not listening to you!

Oh! Yay! Look! There is a room that has no floor on it!
Stand by your side!
Hey, come on now!
Okay, what do we have?
Uh, I do not believe in those crazy diets, you know, just everything in moderation.
I will take those to go. For kids.
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were in the show years ago and then they killed you. What happened there?
It was so stupid, I said things in an interview that I should not have said.
But believe me, it's not going to happen today.
Including. So, what did you say at the time?
Well, I said that I

Ha!
So, you like drums!
It's awesome!
You know, I was worried that their life situation would be unbearable.
Okay, okay, apparently not!
So yes!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, listen, we've already learned a song. Ready? One two three four...
Tequila!!
It's funny.

Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Yes! And he said really nasty things that were only partially true.
I'll go and teach this guy a lesson.
Joey, please, do not do that. I think it's better that we do not know it.
It's easy for you to say, you have not been nearly killed.
Okay, the school is in session!
My God! Is it a gym card?
Oh yes, gym member. I try to go there four times a week, but I missed the last 1200 times.
So, why do not you quit?
Do not you think I tried? You think I
Who is maria
Oh Maria. You can not tell him no, she's like that treat covered with lycra and spandex.
Do you need me to go with you there and hold your hand?
No!
So you're strong enough to face him alone?
Oh no, you will have to come.

Thank you.
Thank you. Mon?
Hmm?
Pheebs, I do not think anyone is mad at this.
Exactly! Because it's past!
Someone will eat that?

Pheebs!
Hey!
Listen, you know how, when you wear pants and you lean forward, I check your underwear?
Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it, I saw that he was wearing women's underwear!
I know. They were mine.
Oh. No! No, it's weird!
No it is not! We were just laughing and I challenged him to try them.
It's weird!
I'm wearing her panties right now.
It's a bit hot.
I think so too. And this small part? Ideal to hold my lipstick.
Yes, I would not know.
And! Do you know what Jake says? The underwear of this woman is actually more comfortable. And he likes the feeling of silk on his skin.
Yeah, the next thing you know, he'll tell you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I think even more than you.
Oh yes, he looked like a real woodcutter in those pink pinks.
I'm just saying that only a man completely safe with his masculinity could walk in women's underwear!
I do not think you can ever do that.
Hey! I
OK whatever.
The lusts of the flesh.
What?
I do not know. A cowboy theme?

Hey, will that come?
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I ... she's beautiful I love her!
Yeah, look at Rach, there's something I have to tell you.
Hey!
Hey! Are you ready to try breastfeeding again?
Yeah! Hi emma. Hey, why do not you think she will not take my chest?
Everything is fine, it takes some babies some time to get it, but do not worry. It will happen.
Yowsa!
Ok honey, you can do it. Open it and put it in your mouth.
Dear Lord.
I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
Oh, uh, yeah, I think ...
Oh look, she's moving away again!
Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Does not she look scared?
You know, I do not really know her.

Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
No, but do not worry, I'm sure they're still here.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment with Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo".
In fact, tomorrow night, it depends a little bit on how tonight
Oh, listen, about tonight ...
No, no, no, do not dare pay me the deposit.
The only reason she leaves with me is because I said I could bring a friend for his friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend looks like such ...
Pathetic disorder?
I know, but ... come on, man, she needs nothing, she's vulnerable.
I think, cha-ching!
Thank you.
Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
You do that.
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Bravo, man! You still have the egg, huh?

"Happy Birthday!"
You pay for it.
What? No-no, it's his birthday!
You sang Happy birthday to 20 different women today!
But it's really
You are no longer allowed to distribute birthday muffins.
Damn it!
Rachel? Hi!
Hi!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
well yeah
Oh wow!
I mean, wow!
I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I never thought I'd go out with her, ever!
Really?!
Yes, but after you said that everything was fine, I thought, "Why not ?!"
Oh, so not really ever.
I must say that you are a much bigger person than me.
I mean, after all we've gone through, I-I just want to have a brother to reciprocate.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh-ho and mine!

Ok, so no toner today. Thanks anyway, goodbye.
No, no, wait! I can not let you hang up! Tell me please.
Well, I have only one thing to do today. I guess I could push him away.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
It's just that, uh, I've been working for ten years in this meaningless and meaningless work and no one here even knows I exist!
Chandler?
I'm sorry?
No, I'm sure people know you exist!
Oh yes?
I work in a cabin surrounded by people.
It's been five minutes since I told you to kill me and nobody looks up from their desk.
Hang-hang.
Hello everyone!
Uh, I'm going to kill myself!
I will come back to you.
I did not understand.
Expect.
Uh, hey Marge!
Ehh nothing.
Nothing.

Apparently, there are like a million guys who can play on Mac, and there is only this robot and this guy who controls it!
I did not know he could get fired!
What am I going to do?
You know Joey, you're a lovely guy.
Thank you, but I have a problem here.
No darling, you have to conquer the guy who controls C.H.E.E.E.E.E. You have to kiss a serious robot ass!
It's not a bad idea.
Yeah.
Okay, but if I have to activate the charm tomorrow, I'm not wasting it here with you anymore.
Well, actually, I'm a little saved for you, Pheebs.
So you think Joey is more charming than me?
Yeah! That's why I sleep with him on the side.
Yeah, you want.
"You wish."
Why are you shouting?
Whoa, that

Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well, it's an appointment.
An appointment ?!
No, no, Pheebs, you must be wrong, because I know you will not schedule an appointment the same night you have projects with a friend!
Come on Joey, do not hurt me about that.
No, I'm going !!
It is true!
Yes, you made me feel really guilty about going out with this girl!
I like, like, I did you something terrible!
And now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
It's not the same thing! It is
Ok, my daughter the other night was special. She was also a scientist!
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!

I do not have time to convince you because he is only there for four hours and I will go see him!
Well!
Yeah!
Well!
Yeah!
What are you still doing here? I told you, lobster ravioli!

Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur ... thing ... anyway.

Yes, and she is very supportive.

Come in.
Are you sure?
Yeah! It's good, it's good. Robbie will stay here for hours.
Huh ?!
So how are you?

Does she use the cups? Yes! I think she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I think she does.
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
No, no, let me in!
Phoebe?
Yeah!
Can you wait a minute?
No, you must let me in now !!
Are you alone?
Yes!
Okay.

Let's go there!
No! You loose!
No!
How is it that we always stay on the ground holding the ball?
I do not know. I guess other people do not care enough.
Hey! It's starting to snow.
Give me this!
Let's go there!

You know what?
Umm?
I bet I could go.
I have five dollars, you can not.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Simply pull or fall. It is good too.
Fan of Knick?
Oh yes.
Oh, boy, are they afraid?
Hey, listen, madam ....... whoa.
Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he could not touch the water if he stood on a boat.
Oh yes? And who do you like?
The Celtics.
The Celtics? Ha. They could not hit a boat if ... wait. They are void, okay?
Oh shut up. You know, it's a year of reconstruction. You ... waah!
Wha? Wha..aa? Let me go get the father. Hey, we need a father here! We need a father!
There is no father.
Oh, oh, sorry.
Okay that's good. I'm fine. I am ... oh!
Oh okay. This way. All other pregnant women seem to be at home.
Okay.

Honey, just give me another chance, okay, we start again. We will return to Aruba.
Dr. Farber, we have some urgency here ... Jason Costalano is choking on his mandate.
Oh my God...
I'll be there, Bernice.
Listen, please, please do not go anywhere, okay?
I'll be, I'll be back.
Okay.
Ok, we'll be here!
To hate you!
Did you see how he was sweating when he came out of there?
Listen darling, if I squeeze the ball too much, you just jump in and you give me some shots because I tell you, it looks
Yeah ... I'm pretty sure I'll marry her again.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He is Satan in a blouse!
Listen, I know it's not perfect, but the truth is that in the end I still really want to be Mrs. Dr. Farber, D.D.S.
Oh my God.
I hope you can find a way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll always be my bridesmaid ...?
And I hope Barry does not kill you and eat you in Aruba.

Listen, Robert's going to be in a second, so, will any of you just tell him?
Oh.
Please, right now, no, every time I see it, it's like, "Is it to lose?" 'Is he looking at me?'
We can not tell him, you can not go see a guy you barely know and talk about his ... stuff.
He is right, even if it is to say something complementary.
Hey!
Hey.
So are you ready for the gym? They have this new climbing wall, we can identify.
No, I can spot you from here.
What?
Ok, listen Robert ...
I do not have time for that.
No, that's what the game is.
What you just gave up very quickly.
Have you seen Joey?
What's the problem?
Oh, just that! You know what my fault really is, because the couch is usually where we
Hey, does anyone want to give me one of these tiles?
What is going on?
He's coming back to my floor.
Yo !! Spackel Boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you've started this, you're going to finish it.
He started mine first!
Build the Cinderelly unit, place the Cinderelly tile.

Come on Chloe! Finish with your client first. Come on Chloe! Go Chloe !!
Can I help you?
Uh-oh.
Uh, you know what, we have doubts about our copy needs. And we will need a little more time to think about it.
Chloe, exchange with me, there are guys here who have a crush on you.
Ok, it hurt us.
Hi guys. I have not seen you since this morning.
Well, ah ........ you know.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night?
We both?
May be. Does it scare you?
Relax. This is the game of D.J. Issac Philly. You should come.
We'll be there.
Awesome. I'm going ah, see you later.
Okay, keep going.

Uh, candles, champagne, yes birthdays are great.
Because you know that love lasts forever, you know.
Nothing like that in this life, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Oh God, Ross, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well.
You know what, I want to talk to you about it so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get in, are you free for tomorrow night's dinner?
Oh yes, I would love that.
Oh great! Me too.
I guess it all started when Rachel had this new job.

And why do you care so much?
Because! You could live my fantasy!
You had fantasies about Emily?
No! You know,
Is that why in college you were the only one to have attended this Ukrainian child?
Yeah that, besides his mother used to put sour cream on everything!
Ahh
Do you like him?
We said it would only last two weeks, you see?
You like it!
What is love really?
Ohhh I
I am a good kisser.
Then you can, can sneak into the cockpit and things will start to heat up, then a stewardess arrives, I watched too much porn.

So, basically, it's very easy. You read the script and try to sell as much toner as possible.
Ok, I can do it! Oh, by the way, I
Why do not we try it.
Oh ok. Umm, okay. Hello, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I am the procurement manager.
Uh, all right, I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.

Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She does not hear it and continues to run, Chandler begins to chase her as a theme
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Hey!
Okay.

Oh, hey, Monday, do you still have your old school dresses and blouses?
Yes, I think I have some somewhere. Why?
Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, Rachel! I made a pile of your belongings on this side of the room. If you could just throw in your purse.
Bloomingdale's
Oh my God, are you unemployed?
No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Who is just a
Okay!
Come on, no stealth!
Our eyes are closed and we are about to cross the street. Very well.
Okayyyyy, open up!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is
Yes, it's for our caterer!
I think I know this girl.
Okay, we're not really going to keep it that way.
No?
No, we are going to paint the sword and replace it with a wand.
Oh!
And also, we do not know what to do with it.
Oh yes, I really know her.

You do not know? Rachel, you put my girlfriend in the balance!
Okay! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with someone else?
You know, hey! You are the one who finished, remember?
Yes, because I was
You always love me?
Noo
You always love me.
Oh, yes, so, you love me!
Noo, nnnnn. What does it mean? What do you want, I mean, do you want to get back together?
Noo!
May be!
Me, I do not know.
Ross, I still can not forgive you for what you did, I can not, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you, I feel so ...
What?!
I come, I feel, I - I come ...
What?
I feel...
Noo !! I do not care! I will not, I will not play striptease face to face with you to practice!
But I made cards !!
Well! Good night. I ride.
Good night.
Do you want to play strip poker to train?

What are you doing?
The key is stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Wait. Warning. Warning.
It still does not work.
Yes I am sorry. Do you have extra pants? Hmm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.

Is not it incredible ?! Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I know they will be
Ohh, I mean two best friends who fall in love, how often does this happen?
do not
No! I am so happy for them!
Me too! So happy for them!
I am so happy and not at all jealous.
Oh no! No God, certainly not jealous!
I mean, I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean, what is 2%? It's nothing.
Totally. I am like 90/10.
Yeah me too.
Hey, do you guys have Chandler on stage?
But no, but you know who stopped here to pick you up, Tennille.

Do you remember the guy from the cooking school that I told you about this coriander?
Oh, of course, Cilantro Larry.
Well, I'm going to replace him as a food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Wow, Monica! What an incredible opportunity to influence dozens of people.
How can you say yes, what about our catering business?
Oh no-no-no, it's just one night a week, plus I can take you all for a
Yay !!
Oh, in this case - Yay! It was me jumping on board.
Oh.
Hey guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for you. Are you ready to party?
Hello.
Hi it's me.
I know you can not bear staying in the same room as me, so I thought I'd try to apologize over the phone.
Everything I
Hello.
Look, I should never have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm
Stop callin '!!
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $ 1000 daily challenge.
Okay!
What is the name of your roommate who is really sorry and would do anything

Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you already at home? !!
Umm, I think he's still outside. What's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me that word.
"Pheebs, I can not do it, I have an appointment, see you later, Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Oh, it's a nickname we tried.
Hey, do you know what nickname was never retained? The Ross-A-Tron!
Hey!
Oh! This is Joseph Francis!
Oh-Wha-Ho! Why are you calling me in the middle? I left you a word!
So what?! It does not give you the right to let me down!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is a possibility of sex!
Phoebe is right, that's the rule.
I do not accept this rule.
When we do projects, I expect you to come.
Okay, I can not just be a way to save time before meeting someone better!
You know, boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but it's for life!
Did you know he was there?
No.
How long have we been at home?
About half an hour.
Love

Lights. Uh, romantic lights.
Ooh good.
So, ah, there was one thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh that's right! I completely forgot about that.
Well, ah, I thought a lot and I look at my life
Yeah?
And I have the impression of having conquered the business world, and I have the impression of having conquered the intellectual world, and now, I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Sensational.
One thing is missing.
What is it?
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Okay.
Monica, I want to become the ultimate champion of the fight.
What do you want?
I want to become the ultimate fighting champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
Okay, my coach, Ho Chi, teaches me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fights. I even designed my own octagon ring.
And I guess you used a ring designer for that.
Yeah.
Monica, I want you in the first row when I win.
I want you to be close enough to feel the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.

Ok to enter?
Yeah, go eat what you want. Dr. Roger was again paged.
Yeah I know, guess who made it beep?
What?!
I am the torn spleen.
Why would you do that?
Because you should not be with him. You should be with me.
Really?
Yeah!
When you talked about Roger, it killed me!
Look, things like last night, it does not happen like that.
You know?
Or at least not to me.
Or with the other two women in the morning, you know I was just lying there and I could not wait to hang out with my friends, but with you, I always know it with a friend.
Chandler!
I know you probably do not want to go out with me, you know, because I make too many jokes and I've never had a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor"
There was only one woman, was not it?
No, there were two.
Including me?
Oh yes.

Hey!
Welcome back!
Hey! Can we continue where we were?
I do not know, I'm still pretty tired of this afternoon.
Why?
Uh, sex.
What sex?
Our sex
We did not have sex.
Well, if I did not sleep with you, I slept with someone who looked a lot like
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Oh my God Stu! I-I can not believe you did that! Now, are you absolutely sure she's a whore?
Either that, or she's the best date, the most expensive I've ever had.

Do you want to watch them. Am I ever going to find a boyfriend? I'm going to die an old girl.
I am your mother
Huh?
Oh, and then Monica joked that she would not go out with a guy like Chandler ...
Hi.
... and he could not give up, and ... I do not really know what happened with that either.
Oh oh!
And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, introduces herself and Rachel convinces her to save her head.
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I do not know what's going on either ...
Wait, let me go get Chandler.

Uh, Mr. Morse, may I speak to you for a moment?
Well yes, I lied before.
Oh!
Oh my God
Now you know what you really think.
Oh-oh, it's a risky little game!
Are you really going to do that?
Yeah. I'm having a baby. I'm having a baby. I'm having a baby!
With whom?
Ah, that's still not the moment.

You said I was boring - Ohh!
When did I say you were boring ?!
Oh my God, I remember it now! We played chess!
Phoebe! You and I have
Oh, come on!
Yes, do you remember that time on the frozen lake?
We played chess, you said I was boring, then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!
Okay, there is a

Okay, I'm leaving!
Because I'm not going to spend another day with someone who wants to sabotage each of my movements.
It's you Rachel!
Yes, I have that.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how are you gay?
You take care of Jill.
OK see you soon!
Good bye!
Goodbye.
I can not believe Jill left. I can not help it, I opened a door.
How about you are moving !!
Look! It's ridiculous. We should pack you !!
Hey, how are you?
Awesome! Monica moves!
I'm not!
Oh really?! So, how come all your things are in this box ?!
Ok, guys. I think you know what's going on here. Okay, guys
No Phoebe I'm crazy!
Well, in depth!
Yeah, I'm just angry!
So keep running.

Okay!
Oh, here's the trench coat you wanted.
Oh great! Wow! Yes, it's comfortable.
Yeah?
Oh! Here we
Okay, you know what, we talked about London a lot, did not we?
No.
I am sorry.
It's just because I could not be here.
Because all I have to do now is pregnancy, it hurts me.
Sorry.
What happened?
Well, you know, a little bit of that, a little bit of that. I made an appointment tomorrow night.
You see, I did not tell you ?! You're already on Ross!
well
Get out!

I just did not see the fast song coming.
hush
hush
Do not try to talk, we will get you in your room, we will soak your feet, everything will be fine.
Oh thank you.
This is so cute!
Yeah.
No, I really think so. There are so few really nice guys out there.
Tell me about it, I feel like holding the fort on my own.
It's Joey, is it?
Yeah.
Wait a minute!
No!
I am nice!
I am the one who danced with the kids all night!
How big are your feet?
!

Uh, you do not mind sitting there. I-I keep this for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I did not know he had a nickname.
Oh, he will not stay here.
Only people in white coats are sitting there and only those in blue blazers are sitting here.
Yes, he must have fallen a few blocks. I just thought we hit a dog.
Okay.
Look, could you put Kathy, I want to apologize.
Oh yeah, man. Joey.
Hey.
Oh no, it's good, do not worry.
Yeah-no, stop making excuses, that's fine.
Yeah!
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I should go, probably.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
I forgot my handbag.
Oh.
No, I really forgot my handbag.

A new place for a new Ross. I'll have you and all the guys at work once it's furnished.
I must say that I am happy to see you on your feet again.
Well I am that. And this case of rage is definitely behind me.
I wonder if it's time for you to join our team at the museum?
Oh Donald, that would be great. I am totally ready to go back to work. What I? No! Wh what do you do? !!

.... and 12, 22, 18, four ... What?
I spelled crazy.
Ross, but me for another box of mint treasures, all right. Where, where are the treasures of mint?
Ah, we are outside. I sold them all.
What?
Monica, I cut you off.
No.
No, just, just a few more boxes.
It does not matter, all right, I'm cool.
You have to help me with a few more boxes!
My, look at you. You have a cookie on your neck.
Oh my God!
So how much have you sold so far?
Look at this. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Oh God, how did you do that?
Okay, the other night, I left the museum when "Laser Floyd" left the planetarium, without even trying, I sold 50 boxes!
That's when I understood, the key to my success, "the snack". So I started going to the dormitories of New York University around midnight.
I sell cookies by the case.
They call me 'Cookie guy!'
Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffs, I need lickers ...
Well, who made these resumes for you?
Me! On my computer.
Like an eclipse.

Hi.
Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Do you really take all that?
Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
Yes but you do not need - What is it?
Thread!
Goal! Where are the disposable cameras?
Which disposable cameras?
Cameras? Do you remember last night, did I tell you to take them?
No, you did not do it
Yes! Remember? Just before cutting the cake, I went to you and said
Oh-oh yes, you came to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my uncle Murray came to see you and gave you a check.
And then you said, "Why are we calling this a check?"
Why not a Yugoslav? "
Yes, then you did that.
So you do not have the cameras ?!
Sorry man.
So? What? What? They left! Monica will go crazy!
Well, I'm sure they are still somewhere here at the hotel. I'll help you find them.
Awesome.
In-in three minutes.

Uh, Rachel, my parents
Ohh! It is a pleasure to meet you. Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello. Well, Joshua, that $ 500 was for groceries.
What?
This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, it's not that's not what it is.
See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, it's a real dress actually.
That is, they are wearing it in Milan, so my job is also to wear clothes, then I see how people react, and then I report to my superiors at
Maybe in L.A?
Yes!
Here.
So, have you ever eaten children?
Well, we were going to do it after ... I mean, uh, then.
Well, we are hungry, why are not we all going to eat?
Oh, yes, well, no need to waste that baby, just stay home.
So we will eat.
Yes.
You'll wear that. We will eat, and of course, you will wear that.

Well, I guess I should have thought of my wife and children before talking to Chef Geller again!
Thank you.
Yes! Looks like it will be a leeeeean Christmas at Dragon House this year.
Enough!
Skinny skinny!

Let me see that.
This one here.
Triscadécaphobie.
The fear of
No! No, the fear of the number 13.
Fear of
It's possible, they really have sharp edges.
Okay Chandler, you're up.
Wait a minute, I think I have the right to use my Angel Pass for a free ride?
This game does not make sense!
You know what? You are just angry because you are losing.
Oh, come on, Ross, I think we're all losers here.
Okay. Chandler, you can spin the wheel or pick a Google map.
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I do not care.
You must choose Mr. Bing.
It does not make any difference either.
Choose, you moron!
I will take a card.
Ok, you chose the Gimmie card! You get all Ross points!
What?!
This game is a little fun.
You do not think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just because you
I do not think competitors are supposed to talk to each other.

Hello? Oh, hello Ross! See? Other people call me!
Very funny Ross!
Very realistic and fun.
Okay.
Oh no-no-no, I did not sign to your lady.
Whoa, maybe I was!
Hey, Monica, this totally exciting girl in Ross's building catches me.
Enter the man! Flirting, mix it!
Yeah, I-I'm-I'm with that.
OK here we go.
How is it going?
It worked!
She beckons me to go.
Ok, I-I'll-I'll be right now.
Let's see, she is on the third floor
Wow! She's pretty, huh?
Tell me, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!

Hey!
Hey!
Oh honey, I'm really sorry, you were right, it feels good!
See? And you do not worry if people are watching, it's just for a second cause, so you're gone!
Faded away! I mean his incredible Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Watch out for the horse! Sorry!

Oh, come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just crossed the hallway! And
Ahh! You're not dressed yet?
Am I naked again ?!
We are supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah all right, I was just talking to the guys. Look at them, I mean, are they okay if they come to visit us?
Wh ?! What about my allergies ?!
Oh yes, your allergies. All her, she hates you.

Shoot! We are running out of soda.
Oh, I'll get you.
Really?!
Nope! Because I am not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Well, my mother's friend, Phoebe, is actually my biological mother.
I found a dry shore.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Oh, my new mom, who is a big and fat abandoned!
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! You do not want to stay here and talk about it?
No, I just want, I have to be alone.
Monica!
Oh.

Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yes baby!
So, we have never heard of your wedding!
We were surprised not to be invited.
No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
What does not like? Cream? Well. Jam? Well. Me to? Goooooood.

Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
So, do you want to come to the restaurant for dinner in the coming weeks?
Sure!
I would love!
Really you
Well, I can not give you a massage because my license has been revoked again!
Phoebe, what happened?
Well, it was an accident ... You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand slips!
Do I have a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Oh no, you are not supposed to divorce before 7 years old!

Uh, that's nice.
I know, is not it?
No, I really think so, it's really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Yeah! And I have it on sale too.
Anyway, I should go, one of the rescuers was about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Well, if you want to have a drink later, we can.
Oh yes, it sounds good. Oh, and listen, it's going to be ...
I know. Thank you.

So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! You first get my pregnant Rachel!
You got pregnant Rachel ?!
Who has?!
You did it!
Yes. Yes, yes I did it. But, but it was, it was just a night. It did not mean anything.
Oh? Really? This is what my daughter represents for you? Nothing?
No! No sir, she is very important to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.
What?!
Oh but not like that. I mean, I mean I'm not in love with her. I love him as a friend.
Oh really? It's like treating a friend? Are you causing her trouble and then refusing to marry her?
Hey! I offered to marry him!
Wh
But I did not want to.
Well, why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp ?!
Tramp?!
I am sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.

Yes, Fran.
I know what time it is, but I'm looking at WENUS and I'm not happy! ...
Oh really really really?
Well, let me tell you something ... you'll worry about it, because I care!
You got it?
Well!
Whooooaaaa ....

Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men?
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
I could have birds.
Okay, Mr. Heckles, we will try to reduce it.
Thank you. I will join my dinner.
Okay goodbye.
Ok, Janice. Janice You have to give me Janice. It was not about being picky.
We will give you Janice.
I miss Janice, though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
"Oh my God."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's all, there, faster!"
Stop with the broom, we do not make noise.
We won. We won!
Mr. Heckles.
How did it happen?
He must be sweeping. They found a broom in their hand.
It's terrible.
I know. I swept yesterday. It could be me.
Of course, you could. We never know.
We never know.

Oh I am sorry.
Where is Chandler?
Oh, he needed time to cry.
I'm free! I'm free!
This oughta do it.

Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, I've been working there since 4 am this morning.
Where did you get fruit at four in the morning?
I went down to the docks. I bet you did not know you could get it wholesale.
I did not know there were docks.
Hey.
Hey.
Aww, is it broken?
No, I have to wear this garment for a few weeks.
Did you tell the doctor that you blew him up and down on your bed?
Nooo I had a story, but then Chandler sold me.
Well, I'm sorry, Joe. I did not think the doctor was going to know he had just fallen off the hook.
What is it? Fruit?
Monica makes jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at home?
Because children need new shoes.
I go in business people.
I'm tired of being depressed by Richard.
I needed a plan, a plan to overcome my man.
What is the opposite of man?
Jam.
Oh Joey no!
It's too hot.
It will only be my lot.

Hey, does anyone else feel bad about Ross?
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Well, he's probably angry after you call him this morning to borrow his glasses.
What? Mine are not tinted.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Ok, I will not have one.
Neither do I
No, no, it's just my tooth.
Okay, I'll have one.
So what happens, you need a dentist? I have a good one.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I come, I, I do not see it.
See it's the problem with invisible dentists.
Why? Why can not you go to his place?
Because every time I go to the dentist, someone dies.
It's so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look at the hygienist's blouse.
Phoebe, what? Uhhh what ?!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my Aunt Mary, then there was umm, John, my postman, then my friend "my cowboy friend" Albino Bob ".
And all these people are really dead?
Yes, while I was in the chair!
That's why I take my teeth so well now, you know, it's not a question of oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Pheebs, come on, you did not kill anyone, these people died when you went to the dentist.
That is, it's, ah, just a coincidence.
Well, tell them. Oh! You can not, their dead.

Hello?
Ross.
Emily, hello! Uh, how did you steal?
It was awful. I felt very bad about the way I acted when you said these wonderful things.
No, no, that's fine. Uh, I'm glad you called.
Ross, there's something I have to tell you, there's someone else.
Does this mean the same thing in England and the United States?

You know what? I will not be able to enjoy it.
Yes, I know, it's my birthday. We should all be here.
So let's go.
Well maybe you should maybe stay for a song.
Yes, I mean, it would be rude of them to leave now.
You know, guys are probably spending a good time.

Okay, I have three of my five.
Three of your five, what?
Celebrities I am allowed to sleep with.
Oh my God! You think about it a lot.
Yeah, it's hard to agree, I only have two places left.
Okay, so who did you reduce it to?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely ....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
Um, you know what, she's too political, she probably would not let you, unless you gave four boxes of food first
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, you know she's too international, you know she'll never be here.
So?
So you have to play the odds, pick someone who will be in the country like all the time.
Yes, because that's why you will not have Isabella Rosselini, geography.

Oh, it's five Ross. Five women had five babies! And I did not have a baby! Why does not she want to go out?
Do you know what I think it is?
I think you've created such a beautiful house for her in the last nine months that she just does not want to leave.
Oh. Look at you pissing me off. Oh my God!
Twenty-one hours, you are a hero.
Doctor, you must do something! I think you have to give me drugs or light a fire and smoke.
In fact, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters, you are about to become a mother.
My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha is fighting you! Suction cup!

Are they still here?
No, honey, they're not, but do not worry, because we're going to find them, and until we do, we're all here for you, okay?
Okay.
Hi.
Can I see your boarding pass?
Oh no, no, I do not have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I am sorry. You are not allowed to enter the bridge unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but I-he just went on.
He's right there, he's wearing the blue jacket, I ... I can just ... just ...
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, all right, uh ... so could you please, uh ... just give him a message for me? Please? It is
Well. What is the message?
Euh, I do not know.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me sir? Uh ... I have a message for you.
What?
It's Rachel. She said she liked the gift and she will see you when you get back.
: Toby ... Oh, for God's sake, I do not know what she's talking about!
There is no Rachel!
Do not leave me cold.

Here's the thing, Janice.
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I am like bing, bing, bing.
You are like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm really sorry. It's okay?
Ow. Uh, that's just my goal. It's just my goal. I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eyes! I hit her in the eyes! This is the worst break in the history of the world.
Oh my God. How many have you had?
Oh, I do not know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. The la la la la la la.
I'm fine.
Okay.
I'm not well. Here it is.
Wait here. Breathe.
How are you doing that?
It's like a gift.
We should always separate.
Oh, I'd like that.

You win.
What did you have?
No matter, nothing beats a three and a six.
That my friend is D-Cup.
Now, have you won a lot?
Uh, wow, 700.
Not exactly 700?
Yeah.
Double it!
What?
Well, you see in the cuts, once you get $ 700, you have to double it.
Really?
Hey, I did not invent the rules.
Now, after receiving the doubling bonus, you get a card.
Now this card could be worth $ 100, bringing your total to 1,500.
Do not get excited, because it will only happen if you make it!

I'm sorry you could not go to Spacecamp and I hope it will compensate.
Presentation of the very special Spacecamp by Sarah Tuttle!
!
Really, Mr. Geller, you do not have to do that.
Oh come on! Here we go! Be ready for the countdown to the mission!
I am a stranger. I am a stranger.
Oh no! An asteroid!

Hey.
Hey.
Where are you going?
At the bank.
Sperm or regular?
Sperm.
So you really do that, huh?
Oh yes, I chose a guy, 37135.
That seems good.
'Fraid, then. Brown hair, green eyes ...
No, no, hmm.
What?

What's the problem, darling?
Nothing nothing.
Aaaah, what's wrong, come on.
That's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.
These are my friends.
They have a problem with you.
In this, they do not do it.
Oh. They do not do it.
But they do not see all the wonderful things I see.
They do not see all the good things and all the sweet things.
They just think you're a little ...
What?
Intense and scary.

Hello.
Hi.
Yeah! You do not like Kathy.
You got me.
Yes, you've been avoiding it since we started going out. Look, I made a
Yeah. Right.
Good and hey! My treat But it's only because you eat nothing, right?
Okay.

I can not believe we are here.
Oh, you make fun of me.
What?
As a wedding present, the hotel wishes to offer you the honeymoon suite.
No!! You fucked us all day!
Who are you?
We are only ten seconds later!
Yeah!
You already have the first class tickets; you have the living room!
I mean we should have free stuff too!
I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Well, you can have the following if you want.
We do not care where we stay.
We are here to celebrate our love together.
We do not have to get free stuff.
We just want to be together.
We need these things.

Yes!
Ok, so why not a handshake?
Oh my God, I'm sorry!
Oh my God, I'm sorry!
I did not want to touch that, I mean

Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I ?!
Wow! Pleasant! Manly and also a kind of slut.
You become a woman.
which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of domination.
Ok, that's it for today.
Oh, does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Yes, it's the new building on Avenue A.
What?! That is to say that I cross the whole city, I am supposed to animate a seminar of graduate studies in ten minutes.
Ooh, man. It will not happen.
Move it! Move it! Move it !! Hey !!! I am the teacher !!

Jason?
Yeah, come in.
So Phoebe, you looked serious on the phone, ah, is something wrong?
No, and I do not think I will.
I can not do that.
Yes. Yes, that's what I did not want to know.
Well, Mark, I'm doing it for the wrong reasons, you see?
I'm just doing it to get back to Ross.
I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Ahh!
Just, schmair!
You know?
Look, if you want to go back to Ross, I'm here for you.
Really?
No-no, I say, I say, I say we answer him directly on this couch.
Right here!
Oh my God. I'm sorry about that.
Its good.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I can just go home and take my revenge.

She's there! Superstar of the future fashion!
Oh Joey, I'm barely
My little sister Dina!
And go again
I saw this movie once when there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally opened it, millions and millions of insects appeared and feasted on human flesh.
You know it would not kill you to respect your wife's private life!
Superb closet full of insects!
Joey. Joey, something seems weird and not that weird. I do not-Whoa !!
Oh hey whoa-whoa, do not worry.
Okay.
When my sisters were pregnant, they had all the strange feelings in the book, it was still nothing.
Really?
Absolutely.
Okay. Oh my God! Oo!
Okay, Rach-Rach-Rach, look at me, look at me, everything will be fine, trust me.
Okay.
Take my hand.
Here we go.
Oww crushing bones!

Oh hi.
Oh it's you. I see you everywhere. I am Jim, Jim Nelson.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson, I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We have certainly met a lot lately.
We have. Maybe we'll see each other tomorrow at dinner, for example around 8 o'clock?
Well, maybe we'll do it. Oh!

Well, it's not something a girl wants to hear.
No, come on, do not start. Ouch!
What?
Stupid balls are in the way.
Never mind. This would probably have been the most constructive solution.
You have chalk on your face.
Huh?
Oh, Ross you're right, I do not know why I always thought it was real grass.
Hey, are you okay?
My wife is a lesbian.
Cool!!
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Hi.

Hey! Where are you in these pants? 1982?
Oh Monica, listen, ah, I saw at the hardware store, they put these designer tiles up for sale.
If you ever want to remake the floor of the bathroom.
Why, what's the problem with the floor of my bathroom?
Nothing. It's just old and filthy, that's all.
I really doubt it.
Oh yes. If you ah, move your cart, you see what color was the tile. Yeah.
I can not live like this! What are we going to do? What are we going to do?
Relax. Here, hold this. This old thing comes right away.
It's a little more than what I wanted to see.
Aw!
Look at this, every inch of this thing is stuck.
It would take forever to lift that.
You should ah, you should just leave him.
I can not leave it! You have dug a hole in my dirty soil.
Eh! Here.
You know it's good, you know we could put it back there after the surgeons removed it from your colon!

Hi.
Hi!
Hey!
Uh, Pheebs, about your mother ...
Yeah?
How's it going?
So good. Oh, we took a nap today and my mother fell asleep on my belly and purred.
This is so cute. I am going to get coffee.
Huh? What did you say Joe? I will be there.
Pheebs ...
I feel so, uh .....
Okay!!
I already come !!
Good God!
Really?! Do you think that will work?
Absolutely! And if not, can I get the extra ticket?
What is this thing?

Hello.
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Hey, Joey!
Hey!
Ooh!
Ooh!
I just said that someone on the - who looks like you on the subway.
And I was going to go and say 'hello!' but then I thought, he did not care to look like you.
It only cost me four dollars. But um listen, I just called to see how are the chick and the duck?
Ohh, they have a
A little, but I have a lot of fun too.
So you still do not have homesickness?
No, I do not think so.
All right, we miss you at seven.
No.
You will see.
Liam, do me a favor. Tell the guys to go easy on Ross, this is his first time.
You do not say!
Good luck, baby.
Ross! Ross! Come on! Come in here! Ross! Come on!
Ross, come on! Get in the bloody fray! Ross, come in!
JOEY !!!!!!

I do not think you spent my wedding funds at the beach house!
We're sorry darling, but we just assume that if you get married after 30, you'll pay for it yourself.
Come on! Admit it! It was the best nap you ever had!
I had better.
Okay! When?!
Okay! Okay! It was the best nap ever!
Uh-huh!
I said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
I want to do it again.
we
Why not?
Because it's weird!
Well! Do you want something to drink?
Of course, what do you have?
Hot milk and

Are you OK?
I need milk.
Ok, I have milk And that's it ... Oh! Better?
No...
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit!
Pheebs, if I had never met him, it would never have happened!
I am really sorry! No I am sorry! No I am sorry! No I am sorry!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry for?
I do not know ... it's the pig!
Such a pig!
Oh, my God, it's such a pig,
Oh he's like a ...
He's like a big disgusting ...
...like a...
... pig ... pig man!
Yes, well! Okay...
Oh, but he was my pig man ... how did I not see that?
Oh! I know! It's because ... he's beautiful and charming, and when he looks at you ...
Ok, ok, Pheebs ...
The end.
Oh my God...
Would not I tell you?
No, no, trust, me, it's much better than I know.
Uh, I just liked better before it was better ...

Well, yes, it's nice to have an unusual house.
It has ah, three nice rooms and ah, no baths.
But you know, the ocean is right there.
Knock Knock knock.
Ah, oh, wait a second. Enter, enter. All right, so think about it and call me back.
Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Ah yes.
Hello Phoebe Abott, I am the daughter of your best friends!
Are you Erwin's girl ?!
No, I mean your old best friend here. Lily, from high school. Remember?
Oh that, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I ... then you have to be?
Phoebe Phoebe Phoebe, yeah. She named me like you, I suppose.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There is Frank

Dude, you have to turn on
Let's go watch it at your place.
No, Monica is watching a cooking show. Come on, I do not want to miss them when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, do you know what we should do? You and I should go get new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Is your cable out?
No, that's it
Joey, why is your cable?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I did not really pay the bill
If you need money, please, just let me lend you money.
No, Chandler.
Listen, forget it, okay?
Look, I know things have been a bit tight since Janine left.
Oh, was she hot?
Whoa ho.
I know!
Yes, but look, I can deal with it.
Okay?
Listen, I can listen to the radio, huh?
And Ross gave me this big book (he holds the
Okay, do you want to see if the joke thief will let us watch the show at home?
Sure.
Paid your phone bill?
Not really.

Oh, okay, I can not take it anymore.
I can not anymore.
So you win, okay?
Right here!
Pheebs?
Steal a jet?
Better to make a spaceship so you can get back to your

Hi everyone, Pheebs is here!
Phoebe!
Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe, woo!
What?! What is it going to do to someone?
This helps the bee to look hard in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I certainly am not.
Now, you know that the bee probably died after biting you.
Aw, fuck!
Back in 30 seconds people!
Hey, excuse me, could you change places with me?
Hey, no question, I'm in the shooter.
Go dude! You have been here all day!
Yes, I make promises here, huh?
We are in 3, 2,
Welcome to our fall telethon. Now, if you appreciate the performance of

ha
Yeah.
Well, what do you know?
I'll see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask him about it.
Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Yeah. Yes, that's what you need a good pill.

What are you writing?
Well, Joshua is coming tomorrow and as I do not have the courage to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put that note in his pocket.
Oh yes? Joshua, call me from time to time, guys like you never go out of style - what did you throw?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey, what did you do too?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian door knobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Without me?!
My uncle dragged us there. But, in fact, it turned out to be very interesting.
Yeah.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean, look at that!

I'm just saying, if I see another picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in this
I can not believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Will you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Well, stop thinking about me.
You can not do it, can you?
So I think of you. So what?
I do not understand. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Well ... he happens to be a very nice guy ... man ...
I mean, come on, buddy, get a
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
No, no, no ... why, because it could become strange for everyone?
Who cares about them.
It's about us.
Listen, I - I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.
Ross, you're like my best friend.
I know.
If we separated and I lost you ...
Oh my God.

Hello? No, she can not come on the phone at the moment. Oh, ok, no problem. Okay goodbye.
Was it my job? Were they crazy? Was it Jack? Does he scream ?!
I'm coming to relax, nobody shouted. Jack was just calling to make sure
Thank God.
Yes, she is fired.

... DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH !!! Thanks thanks.
Hey, here's a question. Where did you get the best oak east of the Mississippi?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you have the most beautiful lace from all over the country.
I'm reading your ad
Sounds good, huh?
Yeah.
Superb entertainment center. Well, beautiful Italian craft work.
Oh my God, are you selling the entertainment center?
Why? I like this thing.
You want it?
Oh no.
Ahh, Gepeto, $ 5,000? Are you crazy?
Hey, the only ad costs $ 300!
Look, I change it to $ 50, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is this ?! And you are called an accountant.
nooo
Oh. What to do?

It's true Ross, I can see you in your new apartment!
And you can see me!
Same as yesterday, same as yesterday.
Does he make his shark attack yet?
Nope. Op, wait! Here we go.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crosswords before going to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.
Yes, I think it's wrong, but there is a link between the points here for you later. Hey, how about brown?
Yes, you are so smart!
Aww, you are so cute!
I know.
Okay, see you in the morning.
Okay.

Hello?
What's with her?
I do not know.
But hey, I know we can decide.
Okay, I'm going to ask you questions and you answer very quickly.
Okay?
Okay.
What do you like best about action or comedy?
Action.
Who would you prefer to sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Dude, you're sick.
Oh I am sorry. I forgot you had this story of Rachel.

I mean, it's amazing.
I know. It's really, really huge.
No it is not. It is little. It's tiny. It is little. It's wee.
Nuh uh. I do not think any of our lives will ever be the same again.
OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
More than jewelry.

Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have some routine questions to ask you.
Really? I dealt with Dr. Wells.
I know, but I am a neurologist.
And for more security, Dr. Wells wanted a more complete overview of your status and he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman.
It was a test. Right answer. Very good, full name.
Clifford Burnett.
Birth date?
November 16th
Age?
Can not you understand this based on my date of birth?
I am a Dr. Cliff, not a mathematician.
I am 33 years old.
Okay. And uh, you're married.
No.
Oh really? So, 33 years old and still single, would you say that you have commitment problems?
Are all the questions also personal?
Yes.
Uh, if you have to know that I'm a widower.
Oh that's terrible. I am really sorry.
Yeah.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
No.
Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance, did you?

Hey! You are writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Pheebs, it's great!
Oh yes!
But you know, Rachel does not rhyme with stupidity.
I know but it's so difficult! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Many things rhyme with Rachel. Donut. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
All good thank you. Can you possibly have a nickname as a nickname easier to rhyme?
Was not your father calling you pumpkin?

Okay.
Ok, I can do it.
I can tell him how I feel.
Just uh, stand up straight.
Take a few deep breaths.
Look confident.
Joey? What's up?
I just went through because I want to talk to you about something.
OK what's up?
What I am doing is creating a climate of support for the people who work with me.
I see. Sidestep nice on the thing to do by the way.
The most difficult thing I have ever done in my life.
You must leave!
Oh!
OK, do not worry. You're ready.
Really?
Absolutely! Fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
Okay.

Now, Mom, everything is fine, really.
Yeah, Ross is great.
He's uh, he's in a different place.
No, he's gone.
No no, you do not need to make a return flight.
What do you mean it could be your only chance?
Do you want to stop?
I'm only 26, I do not even think about babies yet.
Where have you been?
Oh, I just had a baby.
Mazel Tov!

Oh wow! I should go there. I have an appointment tonight.
Oh yes! With whom?
Do you know that girl I talked to who lives in Poughkeepsie?
Yeah.
Not her.
Yes, it's someone else I meet, and I-I can not decide between them.
You know, Poughkeepsie, even though she's two hours away by train, is really pretty, very smart and very fun.
But this other girl, well, she lives in the upscale neighborhoods.
You know, she is, she's as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's
If she is not funny, why do you want to go out with her at all?
Well, I-I want to give him another chance, you see?
She lives so close.
And, at the end of the appointment, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was joking was very funny.
On the other hand, if she did not laugh, she's not funny, she's stupid and a little racist.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey guy!
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Heck!

Oh, here's a whole bunch.
Oh, I mean, she's going to wait for her at the wedding and people are going to whisper, "Oh, that poor girl."
You know?
Then she will have to come back here and live on her own.
Oh my God!
What?
There was a pregnancy test in the trash, and it's positive. Monica is pregnant. So I guess she will not be totally alone.

Hi.
Look, I'm sorry for all this with Roger.
It was not really good, and me, and I want to be forgiven, so I brought you something you will really enjoy.
Now, this is just a loan.
Okay?
I will want to get it back.
So I will go now.
I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can not!

Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
Okay, why do not I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor ?!
Hey, you want to do Joey a favor, maybe you're going out with Joey.

All right, ladies, here's what we're going to do.
I-I want to be with her, I like her.
Oh, I'm good! Go with your instinct, go with your instinct.
Wait, now, what am I still doing?
Come on! Could you please be careful, I could wake up anytime!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No-no-no, it's not Joshua.
What do you want from me, I've never met this guy?
Anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can not stay, but we have a

What do I look like?
Oh, uh, I ... do not care.
Ok, now, remember, no trading.
You get pretty, I understand the mess.
Hi Joey. Well, look what you brought. Very pleasant.
... and what did you bring?
She checks the coats.
Joey, I'm going to wash the taxi and feel my hands.
Will you get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Oh my God.
Hi, it's Janice.

Okay, I have not fixed everything yet. Do not tell Rachel anything, please?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although being the only one to know anything about it makes me feel special. Okay!
Ok, stop-stop! Phoebe ?!
Hi Rachel!
What was that?!
Sorry, mix. Hey, how was the movie?
I have not seen it again!
Well, you better hurry! Angelica! Go! Go!
Noooooooo !!

Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Okay, Pheebs?
Yeah?
Umm, do you know how the other day you talked about how you could not go to London and how you felt a little left behind?
Yeah?
Okay, well, we felt really bad about it, so we decided to take a little trip together!
Ohh, that's so nice! How awesome! Good or? Where is the trip ?!
We all thought of going to a picnic in Central Park!
Yes, we all! All day!
That sucks!
It's not a trip!
I just went out of the park!
What are we going to do five about the stupid Central Park?
"Well, it's right next to me, okay!"
Well, I'll go home and enjoy the triumph of my idea of ​​Central Park.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa !!
Ho-ho-wait a minute, Mr. Kissey!
You know, I wanted to talk to you about this new European thing that you have, and I just have to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and that I do not know why stop!
I was just trying to bring some culture to the group.
It's good, but do not put it in my mouth.
It makes me want to vomit!

She's in there?
Yeah. She's putting it now, it's her.
Oh everything is fine.
I guess I'm just finished with the dating thing.
It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.
It's hard.
Yeah, I know.
On the other hand, in about seven months, you'll have something you'll love more than any guy you've been out with.
Hold on.
Wait until, uh, wait until the baby catches your finger for the first time.
You have no idea.
Thank you darling.
Do you want to have a coffee?
Oh no, I think I'll go home and eat ten candy bars.
Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Oh you did, there are twenty here.
Right. Good night.
Good night.

Hi
Hi! Hi Mom.
It's a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you have pearls of wisdom?
Jack?
Why would you want to serve food on such a sharp stick?
It's a good question, dad. It's a good question
Hmmm.
Congratulations to you two!
Thank you we are so excited
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Wha-What?
Look at this clown!
Just because he has a bigger boat, he thinks he can take the whole river.
Get out of the way, you moron!
Who names their Coast Guard boat anyway?
This
What are they doing here? The coast is all there.
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! It's incredible! Joey holds his breath for almost four minutes!
Guy! What are you trying to kill me ?!

Ow!
Really?! Well, it's like everybody's apartment. It has rooms, walls and ceilings.
Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh, it's the living room.
Impressive.
Okay. It's the kitchen.
Oh, it's really pretty. Wait a minute, can not I see the room?
The bedroom. Well, that's about your ... typical bedroom.
We are always on this side of the door.
Um-hmm.
Yes, but I could not see it.
Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thank you for this beautiful evening.
So who was she?
Oh, that was the blind meeting that I told you about, she called and changed it for today.
Did you like? And I just ask as a friend, because that suits me perfectly.
Well, you look good.
Well, I do not think that, you know.
No, no, no, I would not do it myself, I mean it would be strange.
Yeah, no, I'll ask another girl to do it.
Oh, it's going to be so much fun!
Hey!
Are you excited?
Yeah! Hi, Monica and Rachel are they working there?

Ok, we need now, um sage branches and sacramental wine.
All I have is oregano and
Uh, it's good! Okay. Okay. We now need the sperm of a righteous man.
Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we would not do the ritual first.
Can we just start throwing things?
Ok, yes, ok. Oh ok.
Ok, Barry's letters. The boxer of Adam Ritter.
Ok, and I have the receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of naked Scotty Jared.
Hey he's wearing a sweater.
No.
Eww!
And here's the last of Paulo's grappa.
Hey, Rachel, is not it almost pure ...

Mona? Okay, if I was a salmon shirt, where would I be?
I'm really sorry for spilling wine on your shirt.
Oh that's good.
No, it's still wet.
You know what?
Let me take him out before he goes to bed.
Ooh, I have something you can wear.
Right here.
Oh, uh, I - I do not know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
No-no it's a man's shirt.
It's terribly pink.

Oh that's perfect!
And you?
It's a slash bathroom kitchen.
Okay, I see what you're saying. I will go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of it. He knew! You think we could have a bathtub in our kitchen?

Hey!
Let's go see the show!
Ok, just let me have a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee and it's so close.
Closer than here?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's go skedaddle.
Wait, I'm not going to just drink someone's old coffee.
Ok, your highness.
Uh, Rachel, I'm so sorry. It's good, you want to get back together? Yeah OK. Did anyone else hear that ?!

So, how did you know I was even here?
Your mother called me. So is it?
No, it's a lender.
I'm sorry you had to do it yourself.
I was not alone. I had a doctor, a nurse and a support guy. So, did you see who won the match?
Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They're void.
Yes, they are not so bad.

I'm sorry, I will not be able to go to your imaginary wedding, but I am
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I did not want him to start shouting at me like I was a certain Latour of 1974.
It's Lafite. The 'Latour '74 actually drinks quite well.
Everything here comes. I'm going to do that, I'll tell him, I'll be strong.
I just called one of my friends.
Yeah?
I think I may be able to book
Really?!
What is my darling?
There will be no marriage. Ross and I are not getting married.
What?!
I'm sorry dad.
I do not believe it !!
Oh dad now, stay calm. Please.
Stay calm?!!
How do you want me to stay calm?
It's unacceptable Rachel!
And I want to know why? !!
Is it because this punk Ross does not want to marry you ?!
That's all!
Is that right?
!
Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged.

So, are you like a zillionaire?
And you are our age. You are our age.
You know what you should like, you should buy a condition and then name it like you.
What does Pete Dakota look like?
Yeah, or, or, or Mississ-Pete.
Oh, oh, I have it! Pete-Chicago.
It's not a Joe state.
Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
I have to go, so ah, see you later.
Okay.
You are our age!
So, ah, we're leaving for tomorrow?
Absolutely!
Now get out of here !!
Ok, I'm running out of places where I can touch it!
Look, is there something wrong with me?
I mean, why am I attracted only to guys with no future?
Either they are too old, or they are too young, and then there is Pete, who is crazy about me and who is absolutely perfect for me, and it goes as if nothing had happened!
I mean, seriously, it sounds like something is wrong with me?
!
No.
Ok, I'll go get Frank.
So we walk down the street and I turn to you and say, "Hey, let's hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," do you remember?
And then, and then you turn to me and say, "No, let's hang out at your house." Well, it was a stupid stupid bump.

Yes, I think it was better when you were sad. Hey, do you remember in-line skates?
You know what else I will not miss?
"I am Monica.
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
Even if people are on it! "
"Hello, I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight?" Oh, I should wash it and shrink it! "
"I'm Monica, I do not get phone calls from interesting people, never!"
Hey! I call him!
"Oh my God, I love Ross, I hate Ross, I love Ross, I hate Ross!"
"Oh my God, I can not find a boyfriend!
So I guess I'm just going down the hall and sleeping with the first guy I find there! "
Yeah, we should move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.

Article J437-A, color: winterberry.
Hi uh, listen come here, come in.
I am so sorry for yesterday.
I-I'm really sorry.
It's just that I
Listen Ross, you do not have to apologize. I understand why you were here.
You do?
Yes, you still have feelings for me.
And - to be honest, I still have feelings for you.
And I wish we could solve the Ross problem, but we can not.
It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just was not supposed to be.
Oh my god you're right.
Ross, we must be strong. Ok, I'll go there. Can I? To remember?
No.

I tell you, if you want to take care of that, you should go see my guy with herbs.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I do not want to make it salty.
You know, when girls sleep with boys with strange things on their bodies, they talk to their friends about them.
Give me that.
Hi! Okay, do not be mad at me, but I could not resist.
Magazine clips?
Yes, and I know you would say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how about walking down this Donna Carin's driveway.
Oh, you would! Oh, you should get it anyway. As for clubbing.
It's so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in my bed, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
I know it's a little sudden, and it's a bit hasty, and it's not at all like I'm doing something like that, but that does not mean I can not.
Right?
I mean I'm ... I'm crazy about Pete and I know we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Oh my God.
I know. I need more pie.
Hey Monday, if you get married, can I bring two guests?
You did not break with this fireman?
No, that was my way of telling you.
Well, he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a diary and paints.
He even showed me charcoal drawings he drew for me.
Wow!
Yes, well, he would prefer watercolors, but you know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
So, are you going to throw Jason?
Well, yes, because I have to break up with someone, and okay then Jason is sensitive, but now, Vince Plus too, Vince has the body, see?
So, it's really just for calculation.

Ok, so it's still a tie, 41 to 41.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
No, I only have two points to beat him!
Monica, it was also true
I can not leave! I put four hours!
But...
Look!
You knew that about me when you married me!
You agreed to take me sick and healthy.
Well, it's my illness!
Oh yes, lobster.
Yes, I mean, I've been sick all night.
Yeah me too, all night.
Really?! How come we did not cross each other?
Yeah that's because I stayed in my room. Yes, you do not want to look in my basket.

I can not believe there is a naked whore inside!
Expect! Expect! Maybe she is a whore
Yeah, all right, let's leave these two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones do, I will not do it with a random guy!
Well! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to seeing that!

So.
So.
I just thought we should spend some time together.
I mean, you know, we never really talked.
I guess you'd know, being one of us, right?
I know, I probably should not even tell you that, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really? Me?
Yes.
Oh my god, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you and I really wanted you to love me, and that's probably because I'm totally paranoid, but I kinda feel like you may not be.
Well, you are not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Uh, all right, uh, oh my God, uh, when you and Ross started going out, it was really hard for me, uh, for a lot of reasons, for which I'm not going to bore you now, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you are together, and uh, Monica always says how nice you are and god I hate when she's right.
Thank you. Hey, listen, would you like to go to the movies someday?
Yeah, that would be great. I would love it.
I would love that too. Shoot, I have to go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Okay, Julie.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. What a manipulative bitch.

Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's fine, but I'll go with the one I chose first.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you chose is gone. It's finish!
What?
A guy bought it. I am sorry. I'm sick of stopping him but they put me in jail!
They put you in jail?
The little prison between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to keep the ring!
I know, I'm sorry! But you know, this ring is better! Monica has never even seen the other ring.
Yes, but when he offered me with the ring, I got goose bumps.
Maybe he was the guy.
It was the ring!

No, not that, I mean, and you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'm just going - I'm just going to break up with her.
No No No No No No I mean, do not do that. No, I mean not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his fit.
Thank you, Bernice. Let's go this weekend.
Oh, Barry ..! Come on, it's just as good ..
We can, we can go to Aruba!
When I went for what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh ... it was really nice.
You would have liked it.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right, Miss Green, everything is fine ... Yes, I think we're starting to see real progress here.
What?!
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.

Oh my God! what
Oh, it's a machine to remove the eyes.
Okay, I'm out of here!
I am kidding! I am kidding!
Hey!
So were done then!
Almost! But first, you have to start.
Okay.
This is a glaucoma test.
Uh-huh.
Sit.
Okay.
But your chin here. Now you will feel a little puff of air in every eye.
What?!
A little puff of air, now come!
Of course, now I'm scared.
No, we can go together! But do not wait too long, okay? Because I went out before Friday.
Yes, but I do not want to die!
No, no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!

Chandler, Ross, it's Robert.
Oh hey.
Hi.
Hey.
You have lipstick here. It's good, it's mine, we just kissed.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey hey. So, what happened? A forest ticks you?
You know we always say we need a place for mail.
Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to go to the next step.
Do you build a post office?
No, an entertainment unit with an integrated mail bin is a one-day job, max
Okay. My word! These are well adjusted.
Oh yes. These are my old work pants, those of Sergio Valente.
The electric saw was a little away from me there.

Hi!
Another cheese cake has come! They still delivered it to the wrong address!
So, bring it back down, what's the problem?
I can not say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate a whole cheese cake two days ago and you want more?
Well, I forgot what it tastes ok ?!
It was cheesecake.
It was good.
There was a crust of cracked and crumbly graham crackers, with a very rich and yet very light cream cheese filling.
My mouth just filled with saliva!
You know what? Forget it!
Yes, and we'll drop it down so we're not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

This one comes from me.
Ahh!
It was not on your list, but I hope you think it's really fun.
A scooter!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
No! No, no, I love it. Thank you.
Okay, open the next one. Open the next!
Okay.
Now that you are a couple, we do not have two gifts from you?
For my last birthday you gave me a
Okay.
Happy birthday grandma!
It's better to be above the hill than to bury yourself there.
All our love Monica and Chandler.
It's funny, yes!
No no no no! It was the joke!
No, I know! I understood! It's funny!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No, I know, because to be a grandmother, you have to be married and have children and I do not have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.
It was enough to buy the card!

Hey, Joey. What is going on?
Clear the tracks for Boobie express return. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Joey !! What were you doing?!
Sorry. Bad people.
Hello Joey
Oh! ...Hello my dear.

Man. Can you believe that he only slept with a woman?
I think it's great. You know, it's nice, it's romantic ...
Really?
No, are you kidding? The guy is a monster ..
Hey buddy.
Hi.
Oh, it's attractive.
Oh, I thought you were great in the Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the pleasure? Tell me precisely, which part was the fun part? Where is my puck?
Oh, ah - the kid has it.
The child ...? Excuse me, this is my puck.
You have to do it, man.
Oh yes? Well, I'm rubber, you're stuck, whatever - can not do it. Listen, bring me back my puck.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Give me!
Hey! Hey! No retention in my emergencies!
GIVE ME MY PUCK !!
...Now
Oh, look, wish me good luck!
Why?
I'll go get one of these things.

Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five o'clock. It's good, is not it?
You ordered a stripper for the shower ?! It's totally inappropriate!
What? He will be dressed like a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Hi!
I'm so glad you could do it.
Yes thank you very much. And again, we are sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Try. There is my little girl
She is still angry.
Yeah, I know. Is not it great? One less person with whom we have to talk.
Phoebe, Sandra is also mad at you. It does not bother you?
Oh, it's very, very, very good.
Julie's collar is dilated to seven centimeters, about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
Did you feel Rachel's collar, Rachel?
No, I do not think we'll do that.
We are not going to do that.
Well, if you wish, you can feel Rachel's, then mine to compare.
Do I interrupt you?
Um yes! Thank you.
Oh. Oh wait no.
Later.
No no no! Do not leave me here with these people.
Oh I am sorry.
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!

Try to feed her again.
I have already fed it.
I know, that's why I repeated!
Very good guys, we can not hurt ourselves, okay? It's just what she wants.
Hey.

Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder why you might need me in such a short time! Oh.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Why?
Well, first of all, for having forgotten to throw a bridal shower.
And then for having forgotten to invite you there.
Have you ever had that?
Yeah.
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a lot of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they had to leave.
Yes, we wanted to make you a big surprise and a good shower, and now you do not have any more.
We ruined everything.
Ugh
Well no, wait a minute, it's not true!
No, what was it really nice.
And it works a bit for the better.
What do you mean?
Well now, I'm showering with the only people I really like!
I mean, I get all these presents without having to talk to people I do not even like!
Surprise
On surprise.
Monica

I can not believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair !!!
Well, on the bright side, you will not have to see all these paleontologists without their shirts.
Not you guys.
You understand!
So, what are we going to do today?
They have a games room downstairs! Ping-pong and other things.
Ping pong? Honey, they have a ping-pong! Let's play!
I do not think so!
Why not?
Because you know how competitive you are, I say it's cute, others do not agree, and I'm lying!
I'm not always so bad!
Oh,
I hit you ...?
And...?
... Phoebe ...?
... and ...?
I slammed my head together!

Sorry ah, I scared you there.
Oh that's good. By the way, I just checked the shower massager.
Yeah.
Hey!
I tried to join you at work. There is ... a fire.
What?! Oh my ... Oh my God !! What happened?!
Well, we believe it started here. In the aroma room.
Okay. Did everyone agree?
Well, the giraffe is fine. And the pirate too.
Ohh What is it?
No Phoebe, do not look! You do not want to see what's inside !!
Oh, Foster puppets!

Hey.
Hey! How long before Pete's fight?
Oh, about five minutes. At this moment, they question his opponent. Apparently, he trains by going to Iran and pulls out the thieves' arms.
Hot Dog?
Four, please. I am really nervous. Thank you.
So Ross, how did it go with Bonnie?
What?
Oh!
I have to tell you, I - I did not expect to like her at all, I mean I did not expect to love anyone, but she's really great.
Too bad!
No, I say that I liked him.
Yes, you know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We are still going out.
Ok, I hear you! Are you able to talk about something else?
Hey! Which one is my turkey burger?
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fight begins!
Ok, we will be there. So, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times!
Okay, I had to put lotion!
But it's going to be fine, because from tomorrow, I will lead an experiment and if everything goes as planned, my buttocks will be completely cleared.
The fight is over!

Okay, okay, here it is! What do I look like? Do I look like a guy who does not want to get married?
Yeah! And also, a bit like a French. I had never noticed that before.
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Oh, just hang around, talk about websites.
Yes, we have seen this very interesting website about marriage and how totally useless it is and how it is a way for the government to keep an eye on you.
Yes, Big Brother.
Well, it's a little crazy. Although I am happy to know that you are about to watch what you are watching on the Internet.
Yeah, well you know, it just made me think though, why would anyone ever want to get married, huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love to each other in the world!
Well
Okay it's good to know.
Mr. Bowmont is here !!!

Oh that's great, my friend Joey is in the movie business.
Do you know who I came across school? Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently, Howie is going up now.
Yes, he called me and asked me if he could edit my new movie.
Can you believe that ?!
You know, I-I-I have not spoken to him for ten years and he's asking me for a favor!
Yes, I always hated it Howie.
No, no "How are you?" Dude, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve eh?
Yeah!
Refill?

Hey! How are you?
Well! Good, long time no see.
Yeah.
Like your sweater
Oh hey, back home.
Oh, it's crazy for Rachel, huh?
Yeah. She-Well, she's a crazy woman?
So who does he belong to?
Uh, I'm not an italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Okay.
He is so weird.

Do you want to have fun with Joey?
Yeah!
You know, since I dreamed of him and I can not get him out of my head!
And what's the problem, people do it all the time!
Who? Who do you know who are laughing friends?
Okay, that happened to me ... Don and Janet.
Who are they?
I know them about work.
Both?
No, one of them ...
Which?
I do not know, what are the names I just said?
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Okay, okay, you're right
What are you cooking?

Oh my God! How did you come back here ?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hello firefighter officer, can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the chute.
This is not mine.
Yes it is.
How do you know?
The next time you want to trigger a fire alarm in a chute, do not wrap it in a blanket saying, "Owned by Phoebe Buffay, not Monica."
Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked was always America!
Please link this, it is illegal to disconnect them.
Well! But please God tell me how to stop them from leaving!
There is a reset button under the plastic cover.
Is there a reset button ?!
Ugh, thank you!
Thank you!
There is a reset button!
My God!
Why did not I see that!
Reset button, reset button, where is a reset button?
Oh that's it!
Oh!
Oh my God!

Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Sounds, cursed!
Thank you.
Hey, you know our phone is not working?
What?!
I tried to call you coffee and there was no answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I put it out!
Just as you told him you did! ... just pointing out the irony.
Hey, so listen, I crossed the street and I talked to the porter - I got the name of the voyeur! May I use the phone?
Nngghhh !!!!!!!
May I use your phone? Yes, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating appliance."
Radiator.
Five letters
Rdtor.
Yes, is Sidney here? Oh, right? Sidney is a woman.
Well, you will have to wait your turn.
Well, how long do you think it will be?
Any minute now.
Hey, that ... Heyy ...

Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you received something from Screen Actor's guild.
It's probably a residual check, you can open it for me, I'm a little.
"The benefits have expired."
Hmm it's weird. I do not remember participating in a move called "overdue benefits".
Ok, it's not a check. They say your health insurance has expired because you did not work enough last year.
Let me see that!
Okay.
Oh, I can not believe it!
That sucks!
When I had insurance, I could be hit by a bus or catch fire, you know?
And that would not matter.
Now I have to be careful?
!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching fire.
All right, I guess I have to go get a job. I will go see my agent.
Okay, be sure to look both ways before crossing the street.
look both ways before crossing the street.

I can not believe that Phoebe is going to have her babies!
I know, it's beautiful. Unbelievable.
You know what else can not I believe?
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they did not see us make love.
Do you know something about women?
No.
It's OK.
Okay.

Do you remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats? It was fun.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Hi.
Mmm.
So how did it go?
Oh, you know ..
Did he mention us?
He said he will really miss you.
You had a hard day, huh .. come.
...I love you.
Are your hands still wet?
Uh, wet, yes.
Let's wipe them again.

Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Are you crying again?
Like a
You know, I only know two sure ways to silence a man. And one of them is sex.
What is the other?
I do not know, I never had to use the other.
I'm just saying that if we have sex, he will not talk.
Oh that's right.
You are the talker.
In any case, good idea!
Uh, I have to go to the store; I told him I would buy him more handkerchiefs.
Oh, we have some
No you do not do!

Ok, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
Awesome!
Yes, which city are we close to?
Freemont. West-Westmont, Westburg ah?
So why are you answering? Do you know at least which road we are on?
Yes, we are on Route 27.
Okay. We are resting on Route 27. Okay. There is no road 27. Okay, 93 or 76?
I do not know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we got here.
Okay.
Hey, can you send someone up and down and check every rest stop, and also 93?
Okay!
Yes, no, they do not do that.
Ugh, all right, well someone will come and save us.
Who?
I mean, have you seen a car arrive here for an hour and a half?
I think we should call Ross, maybe he could take a car and pick us up.
No! No, I do not get in a car with Ross, we'll have to live here!
But if...
No guys, I do not get in a car with him, you'll have to think about something else.
Oh well, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So, getting help went well?
I tell you man, I saw him.
Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you are wrong.
I'm not wrong! I would like to be. I am sorry. I bet the barium enema does not sound so bad now, huh?

I know.
Let's try to look from afar.
Okay, we'll look at our future and think about our wedding and the days to come.
Chandler!
What is the problem with your face ?!
I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing get married," not "A local woman saves a drowning fool!"
Hey!
Do not laugh at him!
he is
Aww!
That's all! Take it! Take it! Take it!

We will find love!
Absolutely!
Yes, I'm pretty confident about it.
That's why it's so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
It would be nice to have a small guarantee though.
What do you mean?
Well, you know, some people make deals with a friend. For example, if none of them are married before age 40, they get married.
You mean a backup?
Exactly!
Yes, I understood that.
You do?
Hm-mmm.
Who?
Joey.
Joey ?!
Yeah!
Are you serious?!
Yes, I locked it up years ago!
Wh So If neither of you is married at 40, you will marry Joey.
Yes, we trembled. Yes, but believe me, that's not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh seriously?
Yeah, what am I going to do?
Yes, I'm sorry man. Do you want to go watch?
Yeah!

Hello.
Hi Tag! Did you have fun with Joey last night?
Oh yes! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh that's nice.
Then we went to this bar and he put us in touch with all these women!
Wo-women? Do you mean like old women?
Well a little old, like 30.
Oh.
And I was never used to talking to girls in bars, but I received 20 phone numbers last night.
It's awesome! Wow dude, so Joey really had to teach you stuff, huh?
A little.
Yeah?
How are you'?

Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You are amazing!
I know.
So, does it really hurt as we say?
What did you just say?
You are launching another difficult eight and we are getting married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.
I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes in, we take it as a sign and we do it!
Whoa!
Where did I hear that before?
Matthew Perry talks about signs in Las Vegas.
I guess it must be a movie I saw.
What are you saying?
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! Okay!
Okay! It's a four! And where is where the other?
He went under the table.
Nobody moves! Ok, you look like that; I will look like this!
Okay!
It's here! It's here!
It could be a four or five. It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.

Well, that's it. I'm finished. Phew! There come the meat sweats.
Joey, we are all very proud of you.
Yes, I think we can expect a call from the President at any time.
Is there anything we can do for you?
No, nobody presses my stomach.
You can keep these pants on.
Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you have here? What is it? Pie?
Yeah, do you want some?
Ah, just cut me some ribbon.
A little bigger
Little bigger.
What?!
Are you afraid of missing ?!
Cut me a real piece!

Phoebe, oh my God! What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God!
Of course, of course.
Umm, please excuse me for a moment, please.
Umm, do you know each other's home towns?
Why do not you do what's going on?
Well, not much.
But, I just thought that since these guys just got engaged, maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, you know?
So, could I settle down with you for a few days?
Uh, all right, yes, of course. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing, why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yes, that's it! I go to the movies and it starts in about five minutes.
Do you realize that I have a class full of students?
Oh I am sorry. I am so rude. Does anyone want to come to the cinema?

Look, look, there must be a way to overcome this difficulty.
Ok, I can not imagine, I can not imagine my life without you.
Without, without those arms and your face and that heart.
Your good heart Rach, and, and ....
No.
I can not, you are a totally different person from me now.
I thought of you as someone who would never hurt me, never.
My God, and now I can not help but imagine with her, I can not, no matter what you say or what you do, Ross.
It just changed, everything.
Forever.
Yes, but it can not be that, I mean.
So how is it done?

The windows are clean, the candles are lit.
Uh, the belt is too tight, must change the belt.
Did I return the fish?
No, because I made lasagna.
Am I out of control?
Just a contact.
Mon, I do not understand.
I mean, you've been dating this guy since, like what, his ... midterms?
I mean, why all of a sudden are you so ... Oh.
What?
Tonight could be the night?
I do not know.
Look, he's a great guy and I like being with him but ... you know.
Things are coming and they are coming.
You do not plan these things.
So, you shaved your legs?
Yeah.
A-ha!

Ross!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
OK, Raymond, Joey, you're up.
Hi!
Ok, well, let's try one. Whenever you are ready.
Uh-oh.
Is there a problem?
Well, it's noodle soup and uh, I work with tomato.
But it does not matter, no problem.
No problem.
Hmm, noodle soup.
You know, that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
How is it different? Oh! Yeah!
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay. Let's do it again.
Okay.
Hmm, the soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean the soup!
GOING !!!!
You know what? We have to move on.
No! No! I-I can do it again! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damn it!

Okay. Give us just a second. Ross!
Yeah?
Give him money.
I really think they are out of the rooms.
They are not!! Ross, they are just saving them for important people !! Okay?! And if I was the president ?!
Well, we would have a lot of problems, you do not know where the countries are.
Okay.
Uh, would it bother you to check if private parts could open?
This is a hospital.
Okay.
You know what?
I must say that I really do not like your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem with-Whoa!
Oh my God!
Whoa!
What what?
Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Do you want to see a semi-private room?
Yeah, it could not hurt to watch.

I'm just saying that if the dogs experience jet lag, then, because of all the things, seven years of dog to a year, so when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he loses not just hours, he loses like a week and a half.
Now that's funny. Who are they?
The blonde woman is my ex-wife, and the woman who touches her is her ... intimate and personal friend.
You mean they are in love.
If you want to put a label on it.
Wow, uh, all I should know?
Oh my God, Ross, I can not do that.
Ok, fast and painful.
Oh my god ... okay. Well. Well. Okay. Ross, please, do not hate me.
Oh what? What what?
Do you know Marcel?
...Yeah?
Well, I ... I lost it a bit.

Hi Pheebs!
Hi!
How is it going?
Well.
Umm Pheebs, remember that when we were in the cafe, we decided that I was going to keep the cute guy's cell phone?
Yeah.
And remember how I said I would keep it in my bag so that if it sounds, I can pick it up?
Yeah!
And do you remember stealing the phone from my purse ?!
Ooh, now you've lost me.
You stole the phone!
No I do not have!
No? So you say that if I called it, it would not ring?
No, okay. But while you compose, let me show you the features of my new handbag that rings. Oh, it works!
Phoebe!
It's not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why not check the copy room? Maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I leave them in the copy room?
I do not know Tag! How can your genitals phone? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Well.
Thank you. Hello? I still do not understand.

It's okay'? Welcome. Happy to see you!
It will be your phone.
It's awesome. But uh, I do not really expect a lot of calls.
No, you answer and make promises.
But I'm the host!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You will answer the phone.
You do not seem to understand. You see, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here is your phone doctor.

Hi guys.
Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out with a noisy guy upstairs?
Well, he is very charming.
I know, he's too charming, but if you start going out, it'll make it even harder to hate him.
Well, you're just going to have to try.
Joey, where are the
I do not know, Chandler is supposed to let them pass ...
Phew, close one.

Oh!
Look what happened!
Do not get your hope, we can only see it from back or neck.
I wish that the networks diffuse another nudity than the buttocks of Denis Franz.
Hey.

Ok, ten streets down. Five to go.
Oh, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh I am sorry! Do you need a break?
My boots in tanning! Hey! Can you get closer so I can see the price?
I can see it from here. It will cost you a husband.
OK I am sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just give me my boots.
Come over!
Oh my God!
Yeah, you like that, do not you?
Oh yeah right here!
You want it there? You take him there baby!
Uh Phoebe?
Yes, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you, and uh, we'll never do that again.

Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you're supposed to be!
Huh?
Because I really can not understand it!
I'm talking to you and it's nothing.
You look at me, and nothing.
Nothing.
You make me fly! High! Ok, we'll get it here tomorrow.
Well, that was ah ...

What?! What are you doing?!
Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We made love and we fell asleep.
No, we were in the middle of sex and
Nooo! No that's not true. No, the best time of my life! Yes, you rocked my world!
Do not worry, Chandler, it's not a US globe.
Hey guys, I'll go for a ride.
Phoebe, why are you moving your bag?
Oh no!
Seriously, it's moving!
what's inside?
It's just my knit is everything! Yes! I knitted that. I'm very good.

There will be a moment in each of your careers where you will have the opportunity to get caught by another soap opera actor.
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
And I am ashamed to say that I took it, I advised another actor to play a homosexual role.
Yes, we both auditioned for the role and, uh, it turned out that they liked the stupid gay thing and threw it away.
And now, he has a two-year contract with Susan Luchhi, the first lady of the daytime television, and I'm stuck here to teach a group of people, most of whom are too ugly to be in television.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

Rachel?
I'll be outside in a second.
Oh. It's so unexpected! I uh boy I'll tell you that it's just such an honor to be nominated for a
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
in reservations at 8:00 am by Neil Simon. Thanks Neil. Thank you for the words.
Ok honey, you can finish this later we'll be late. We must go.
Please, do not play music. Just another one.

I can not believe you do not want to know.
I mean, I can not not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and that Carol knows, and Susan knows ...
And Monica knows ...
Wha, heh, how could you know, I do not even know!
Carol called me to thank me for lasagna, I asked her.
So what are you gonna be?
Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows and I do not know!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited to be an aunt!
Or an uncle ...
Hi Phoebe!
Hi Pheebs!
Pheebs!
Well!
Phoebe, what's the problem?
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm uncomfortable.
Oh, ok, it's me!
Hey, Chandler, this table closes at 7 am, come on.
Well.
Phoebe, what is it?
Okay, do you know Paolo?
I know his work, yes ...
Well, he made a move on me.
Whoa, the store will be open tomorrow!
No more coffee here, please!

Hey.
Hey. What are you doing here?
Well, I thought a lot about what you said, and uh, I realized, at least, maybe I was a little critical.
Yeah, oh, but oh ...
Listen, Phoebe, remember, hey, they just filled their Christmas ...
Destiny.
Sure.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay. Yuck! This one does not look very full.
Oh, that's it, it's one of the old ones, it just takes it to the back.
You keep the old ones in the back, it's so age-old.
We must make room for the new ones.
So, what happens to old guys?
Well, they enter the shredder.
Why do I feel that it's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo !!!
Hey! Hey !!

The light is always off?
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they take a nap.
Oh please, they make love.
Shut up!
So, whaddya think George is like?
I think he's shy.
Yeah?
Yeah. I think you have to pull it. And then, when you do it, he is a BCBG animal.

Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you do not know me, but I'm a big fan. I want to say,
You're not with this girl there?
Well, yes, a little.
Uh, but it does not matter, let's see we have an understanding, um, let's see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you.
No, no, no, it's flattery.
I am sorry.
Oh no, no, no, wait wait Isabella.
Do not reject it so fast.
I mean it's a unique opportunity in a lifetime ...
Yes for you. Is this the list?
Well yes.
Can I see it?
Um no.
Come on!
But ok.
I am not on the list!
You see, but it's not the final version.
It's laminated!
You see, you were on the list, but my friend Chandler raised the very good point that you are international, so I hit you for Wynona Rider, local.
You know it's ironic ...
What?
... because I have a list of five funny coffee trees and yesterday I hit you for that guy over there.
We are just going to be friends.

Get out of here lurker yourself! Keep on going! Get!
Hey Pheebs!
Ohh! You have made up!
Yes, I could not blame him too long.
Yes, she could not live without Chan Love.
Ohh, take a room.
We have one.
I know. Use it.

Oh my, listen I have to ask!
Ok, Joey Tribbiani invited me to go home, does he do it now with a lot of girls?
Yes a lot. A lot a lot!
Ohh! And I am one of them !! Wow! Oh, I can not believe it! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, you know it's none of my business, but are not you married?
Yeah. Oh, I just wish we could not be married for a bit! I just want to be like on a break!
Ross! I think she's trying to do something with you to avenge me!
So that's the only reason she could be here, huh?
It could not have anything to do with the fact that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put a
Ross, I tell you she's using you to avenge me!
You know what?
I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Whoa!
Uh, it was your sister actually.
She thinks she's just using me.
So?

I am sorry.
What are you doing here?!
I-I came to fill your ice bins.
What?!
Uh, all right, all right.
I took this picture in your fridge.
Ok, because I know it's my dad.
Yes, here is Frank Buffay and you stand right next to him.
Now, look, I deserve to know where I come from.
Okay?
So, if you can help me find my father, then you should!
Otherwise, you're just mean!
So, tell me the truth!
All right, the man on the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My father is Chuck Magioni?
No, no, it's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
And I'm really sorry, but I do not know where your father is, and that's the truth.
Oh.
But, uh, you're right.
I think a person should know where it comes from.
Wh-that's why I ah, ah, okay.
I am your mother
He h?
You know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I felt a little at a time, and ...

What happens to your accent?
Come again?
What is this nonsense?
Okay, I'm not English.
I come from Long Island.
I was really nervous and the accent just came out.
I am sorry.
So, if we could just go back to the conference.
Umm, were there any questions?
About paleontology.
Okay, I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I messed up.
But what you think of me is really important because I hope to get a permanent job here.
So, if you give me another chance to make a good impression
Ross !! Are you insane?! I am
Well, hello Rachel!

Where are you going, Joe?
For a walk.
Oh. Do you mind if I join you?
In fact, it will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Your thoughts? Plural?
Okay, all right, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I have to see her!
I'm afraid I will not let you do that, Joe.
Now, are you telling me that I do not see her?
You kill me guys!
She is a forbidden fruit!
It's like ... as if she were the princess and I'm the stable ... Why do you do that, huh?
Did Ross tell you not to let me go?
Yes, in fact, he did it, so I can not let you go.
Huh. Interesting. Now, there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. These are the kinds of things that big novels do.
Great novels?
Well ... mediocre porn

Okay, I think we can get the assessment before they see it, but we'll have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.
Now he does not come home until 10 am, so he has no problem, but his assistant, Betty, arrives early to have her breakfast at her desk.
It's a little sad.
Yeah, ben Betty is a little sad. That's why I think I can attract him with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her,
I got it!
Ride!
Hi Rachel, do you have a minute?
Yes, of course, Mr Zelner, for you, just minutes. Okay. Well. Abandon the plan, abandon the plan.
In fact, I would like to speak with you two.
Okay. Well, can we, can we get you something, Mr. Zelner? Maybe chocolates?
Cassie, do you agree?
Yeah! Thank you very much for letting me stay here.
Oh! No problem! I
What?

You are iron.
You are steel!
Let me ask you something. How come I call an hour and a half when I call your IT help desk?
I told you, we are adding new operators all the time. Can we focus on my training?
I mean why, of all people would you like to go out with Chip ?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools ...
Ok, that does not help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to a place where you were popular, and you had to get out of Chip's bike and wear his letter jacket.
I went to one of them where I wore a group uniform that they had to have specially made.
They had to have that specially done ?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec courses.
Oh my God, they told us it was for the mascot!
At the time, I thought I would never, never have the opportunity to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he called me and invited me out.
And the fat girl in me really wants to go.
I owe him that.
I never let her eat.
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh really?!
Yeah. If it were possible, could you leave it somewhere and go make love to another guy?
I'll try.

Hey! Great guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl with whom you dance.
Yeah, yeah, alright.
Uh, buddy, I came with this girl and I had this plan to kiss her at the New Year's countdown - I'm trying to win her, so I wondered if
Oh come on, man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, sweet!
I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could let you know
Ross, finish! It's not like she hates you.
Yes, but
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be unique.
Huh. Do you know what is not unique? A twin!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh, Phoebe is here! Okay, turn off all the lights and watch the movie!
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Oh, do you like that? Do you want to know where I got it?
Sure!
He had a flea market!
Did you buy your sheets at a flea market? Ross, come on, you have to loosen the drawstrings a bit.

And Joey?
How do you think she's going?
Am I the only one who does not think she's hot? Ross?
Uh, I mean, I think she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Thank you!
Now that Rachel is gone?
So hot that I cried myself to sleep last night.

Oh, god help us.
What?
Kitchen tile for the ugly ugly dude. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking for a favor here. If I do this for her brother, Angela may come back to me.
What is happening here? You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but I made a big mistake. I should never have broken up with her. Could you help me? Please?

So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Jump on you in the shower over there.
Yeah! And maybe one day we could find a place with two bathrooms.
Listen Carol, uh, I thought, maybe we could spice things up a bit.
What do you mean?
Carol our sex life is-it does not work
Hi little guy!
Hey, hey, hey, why do not we get shoes, huh?
Why not show Dad how you can put your shoes in your room!
Yay!
!
Yay!
Yay!
Seriously, our sex life, I thought, maybe I do not know, we could try new things.
You know?
To have fun?
Like that?
Well, I do not know, uh, if we were too attached to each other?
Hmm, some people eat things on top of each other.
Nah!
Umm, you know, we could try vulgar words?
Um, we could, we could do a trio.
I like this idea!

Hey Sophie!
So, who had the idea to put everyone at the table on skates?
Oh, a silly customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my God, they took my idea!
It was you?!
Yeah! Ok, that's it.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Oh my God, are you guys?
Are you doing OK?
Oh my.

Sit down!
Hi.
Oh my God, Joshua!
All these things I said about not being ready
They are not true?
No, they are all true.
Oh.
But
Oh! Oh, I love it but.
Do you want to go inside and have a coffee?
Yeah.
Okay. Everytime.

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you will not believe what I have to do to work today.
Yes but Ross you
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs some bumps!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just thought we could have them whipped, then add onions and peas.
Why would we do that?
Well, because they would be like my mother made them before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes are coming.
Ok, goodbye guys. Thank you for everything. Oh sorry! Oh sorry!
The most incredible thing happened. The outsiders have just escaped.
The ball?
No, no, the cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's everywhere in the news. Just before reaching
I can not, I have to go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog went wild on the town. How often does it happen?
Almost never.
Do you have the keys?
Okay.

What do you think?
Lotsa things.
Which do you think she is?
Can I help you?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to watch.
You do not watch dance classes. You
What does she mean?
I think she means' you
Okay, do you see anyone you think is me?
People! Last time, empty yoghurt containers were trailing after class. That it does not happen again!
She could be you.
Let's start. Five, six, five five seven seven eight ...
Ok, I do not understand that!
I get it totally!
Have you ever felt that sometimes you are so incredibly uncoordinated?
What? You just click when they click.
Good people, now everyone takes a partner.
Okay. And, my, dead, mom, said, you are, that. I am with Rachel.
Awesome. This is the gym class again.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it's never been that way.
Nooo, it was not.
Ooh, and it's so nice to have this little sink here ...

Oh, that's not nice? It's so quiet, I could lie here all day.
I know
Open your curtains! Open your curtains!
I am so happy that we have adjacent rooms!
The sun is out!
Hey! Do you remember when I had corneas?
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I go to get magazines and lotion
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Nooo!
Damn it!
The walls are rather thin, guys!

Hi, my name is Joey Tribbiani and, with all due respect, I would like to donate some liquids.
We are actually at the end of one of our research cycles and we are not looking for candidates at the moment.
Too bad. I saved a little. Uh, are you sure there are no studies I can participate in?
Well, here's a calendar of what's going to happen.
Thank you. Well, but this one is starting now.
Oh, that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a study of twins.
But it's $ 2,000.
Sorry.
Well how about this one? Test the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive receptionists.
We have already got the results on this, and they are not good.

Hey! How are you'?
Well, little has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes it is! I made cookies!
Oh that's good. I'm still full of your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now because they are hot from the oven.
Okay.
Oh-ho! But not here! You can not eat them in bed, remember? No crumbs!
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Okay!
What are you doing?
That does not lock the fact?

You know, it still smells like ape in there.
This saves us a conversation.
Well, listen, it's been great but I'm officially erased.
Me too, we should go.
No.
Oh. Mine does.

Ok, here is another camera.
Right. Not that serious. Stay loose.
Why do they continue to do that?
If we want to go to the camera, I think we have to get on one of these platforms.
They have registered these people all day.
Right.
Hey, what did you do to put yourself in it?
Oh yes? When you learned to dance, did you forget how to put underpants?
Yeah!
Hey! You are a good dancer!
Really?
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a bit.
What do you mean?
Like that.
That's it, feel the rhythm. It's better.
Uh-huh.
Ok, you dance with this girl there.
No, no, no, no, we came together!
I do not see it You dance with the big guy there. Great guy, raise your hand!
No-no hey buddy, please, let me dance with this girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Really, do you think? I do not..

Why are not you back yet ?!
Is there anyone?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm right, I'm just looking out the window. In sight. What are you guys doing?
We have some
Oh, he brought her back to her apartment.
Who? Is she your sister?
Ugh, she
My god, Ross is on a date with your sister! How is this weird ?!
Oh my God, look, look, he undresses!
He takes off his coat!
Oh, it's just terrible.
Ross! Expect!
Elizabeth, thank you god! I was just thinking of
You are afraid !!
What?!
Ok, the break is still here!

Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I understand that if you came to hit me, I deserve it.
No, I do not want to hit you.
Oh what then? Hit me?
No.
My son? Rather serious. Oh, hello Katie! What are you doing here?
Well, the delivery was delivered to you and I understood that they had forgotten it.
Oh, it must have been pretty obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Listen carefully, home delivery is really part of my job description.
Oh.
Oh uh, I really came here to ask you out.
Oh! Wow! Um yes! That sounds good. I'll just put it back in my pocket, pretend
Sure!
Hot slut. No! You are a horny slut! Noooo! You are the horny slut! No! You are a horny slut!

Chandler !! You have the best taste in men!
Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had a great time last night! I mean, I think it might turn into something serious.
Really?! I thought you were not looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for an adventure.
Well, you know, maybe. Did not you tell him that? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for an adventure ?! You do not say that to the guy!
Why not?! I would love to hear that a sexy girl was just trying to become oh, I see.
Oh, between telling him I wanted to have an adventure and I'm going out on the first date - oh, he's going to have a bad idea.

Well, I'm back in high school, I'm in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize that I'm totally naked.
Oh yes. I had this dream.
Then I look down and realize that there is a phone ... there.
Instead of...?
It is true.
Never had this dream.
No.
Suddenly, the phone rings.
And they did not look at you before ?!
Finally, I think I'd better answer,

Honey! At table!
What does my little chef have for me tonight?
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Yes! And a lot of that!
Thank you darling. Give me some sugar here. Okay.
Ok, here we go.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How are you'?

Something is wrong with Underdog, and they can not get his head to swell.
In any case, his head looks like Broadway, that's right, and I think ... how inappropriate it is.
Um, I have something in my eye, Joey, could we check in the light, please?
Oh my God.
What?
Hi! Were we at the same table? It's like ... cocktails in the Appalachian Mountains.
Come on, they are close.
To close? She has her tongue in her ear.
Oh, like you've never been so agitated with Ross.
Joey, it's sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's not really true, is it?
Well, who can say what is true? I want to say...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Okay, listen, I'm not proud of that, okay? Well, maybe I'm a little bit.
Oh!
Ow!
I'm outta here.
Wait wait. You want it, I want it. He loves you.
Really?
Yeah. I think if we put our heads together, we can separate them.

Hi! A wedding please!
Yes, we want to get married!
Okay.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What are you doing?
Oh it's
No, only because it's the graduation song.
Okay! That's it ...! We will get married!
Are you sure you want to do that?
Hello, Mrs. Ross!
Hello, Mr. Rachel!
Expect! Okay!
Would you ever be a substitute for someone?
It depends on who asked.
What if I asked?
Oh, Monday, of course.
Really?
Yes. You do not ask are you?
No.
Yes! Totally!
Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!

You will not believe it! Joshua went to work today and guess what happened?
He asked you out ?!
No, but I showed him cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Saucy!
What is it?
Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, should I be scared?
I know this switch does something, okay?
I went down to the town hall and found them.
All I had to do was pay $ 25 and wait in line for three hours.
Wow! If only more people knew.

Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all think. But Chandler is in
Yeah! No, that's what I thought.
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before judging me.
Oh, no one is judging you.
Oh! Okay! You, the right place at the right time, call me!
Oh man!
I want so much this place !!
I was so sure it would work!
There are twelve dollars that I will never see again!
All right darling, we'd better go see this movie.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye Chandler! I already miss you.
Ok, did you see that ?! With the inappropriate and pinch !!
In fact, I did it!
Ok, so now you think she's attracted to me?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows for us!
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows it and she's just trying to panic us! That's the only explanation for that!
Okay, but what about my crushable buttocks and my biceps bulging? She knows!

Ross, you've been here a long time. I'm starting to be a little panicked.
Okay, I'm going out. Hey, can you turn off the lights?
No, leave the lights on.
Oh my God!
Do you want to go now? Because I'll take you right away, buddy! You want to leave?
Oh good.
Ready? Fight!
Okay, you know what, in fact, it's great. It helps a lot. Thank you.

Remember that something so long and difficult is going to be difficult to achieve. Fortunately, I have a lot of experience in this area.
Can we focus here, the life of a naked man is at stake!
I tell you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a fat guy dead on a stick.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go.
Stable.
Stable.
Ok, a little higher.
Watch out for the angle.
Okay, okay, we're getting to the window Thread the needle.
Thread the needle.
He is alive! He is alive!!!
And yet, we always push it.
OK, remove the device, remove the device.
He does not look happy.
Hey-hey, now he shows us his device to sting.
Hey, it'll never happen so far, buddy!

Well, they have unusual animal names for each other.
Including uh, nasty bitch and uh, bastard sick.
Oh my God oh!
Contraction!
Yeah? Okay.
Ooh! Ow !!
Are you looking at her ?!
No!
Do not look at her bastard sick!
Honey, I swear! I did not look at her!
She is in work! You like that, son of a sick bitch!
Umm. Uh, I - I'm just gonna
See? See? It was because you were looking for a big pervert!
No-no, I'm sure no one was watching. I just want a little privacy.
Are you missing your girlfriend?
Ignore them.
Ross.
What? What?
He looks at me
Hey! Do you want to live to see your baby ?!
Do not talk to my husband like that, bastard!

Pat Sajak?
Yes!
Alex Trebek?
Oh of course!
Chuck Woolery?
Absolutely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host that I can not kick.
Say it!
Let's say we are unagi!
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Say it!
You know what? I can easily get out, but there is a chance that you are very hurt!

Hey, Rachel, I can borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yes, it's in it.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oohh !! Ohh! Oh oh oh! Oh oh !!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!!!
Yes. Yes.
You?! And-and you ?!
Yes, but you can not tell anyone! Nobody knows!
How?! When?!
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a fuss about it.
But it's a big deal !! I must tell someone!
No no no no no! You can not!
Please? Please?! We just do not want to talk to everybody, okay? Promise me not to say anything.
Okay! Dude, it's amazing! I mean, it's
I know, it's great!
Aww, I do not want to see that!
We are so stupid! Do you know what's going on there? They try to take Joey!

And my sophomore was Ms. Thomas, and my freshman was Ms. Cobb.
Mrs. Mrs. Gobb?
No Cobb, as in Cobb salad.
Now, what exactly is in a Cobb salad?
Ahh!
What are we going to do? What are we going to do?
Uh, uh, let's move on. Ducks or clowns.
Oh, are we going back for the baby?
Do you have a better idea?
Okay, call that in the air.
The Chiefs.
The head is.
Yes! Phew!
We must assign heads to something.
Right. Ok, ok, ducks are heads, because ducks have heads.
What kind of scary clowns have come to your birthday?

Ok, some tips of the trade.
Now, I have never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take tweezers and start shooting.
Or, ah, or, let's say I want to convey that I just did something wrong.
That would be the base "I have a hook in my eyebrow and I like it" Well, let's say I just got bad news, well, all I'm doing here is trying to divide 232 by 13.
And that's how it happens.
Big show interpreting everyone tonight, class returned
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Eh eh.
Then I will have to ask you to keep it to a minimum.
Who are you?
Hi, I'm Eric, I'm going to be Chandler's new roommate.
I am Chandler's new roommate.
I-I-I do not think so.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
But, he told me on the phone.
He told me in person.
It's weird.
Well, I'm going to my new apartment now. Ehh!

Hey! Look who I found!
Oh, hey guys!
You know, the birds have a very good sense of direction and I thought maybe they could help us find where the gifts are hidden.
Yes, if the gifts are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your smart jokes - ideas?
No!
I did not mean it!
Ok, come on guys, show us where are the presents!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica had garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could do to make Monica as good as garbage?
Hmm, what about my azzz?
Hey, it's hollow.
What?
This bench is hollow! I can not believe I never knew that! Oh, the gifts !!!
No, do not look at them directly!
What?
Well, no, we could watch them!
I

Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's going to take time. I - I wish you called first.
Oh, I'm fine, I'll come back later with your dad.
Oh good.
In fact, I needed to talk to you before birth.
OK what's up?
I brought something I want to give you, assuming of course you want it.
Ma, are you asking me to marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
No, come! Thank you.
Listen to me!

It might have happened if I had been more nurturing, if I had paid more attention or if ... I had a uterus.
I can not believe that!
I know no, no, you know you do not deserve it, you do not do it, Ross.
You are really very good.
Thank you.
And you are so nice. And you are nice
Thank you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Huh?
Okay that's good.
Oh.
Wait wait.
What?
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
What?
No, I can not take it out.
Rachel?
Yeah. Hi Mark!
Hi. I just talked to Joanna and she loves you. You have it, you have the job.
Oh yes!
Yes.
Oh my God!!
Bravo !! -lations-lations.

I can not believe I did that! What an idiot!
Oh, stop beating you up!
People make mistakes!
These things happen!
There is no message you forgot to give me, there is?
Apparently you're not very good at it!
I
Philadelphia cream.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I have goose bumps.
Really?
You see, I'm wearing diapers and it's hot.
Yeah yeah.
But if-no, look, okay. These jerks may not care about you, but about the universe! And that says a lot!
Did you hear that ?!
I do not need you to pay attention to me!
Because the universe cares!
The whole universe!
I really wish they cared a little.
You know, I do not ... I do not think it's you.
It's a weird place.
Hey!
Guys!
Oh no, it's you.
Yeah.

I like this one. He seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
They can not all be bad. Find the one where you make the eyes of your bedroom. Oh, that's it.
Oh my God! These are the eyes of my room ?! Why did you already sleep with me?
Do you really want to shoot this thread?
I'm having a great time!
Me too! I'm sorry this guy in the subway has licked your neck.
Ohh No it does not matter, it's a friend.
Hey, uh, I do not want to be presumptuous, but I have these two tickets for the ballroom dance finale tomorrow night if you want to go?
Yeah, well you know I-I mean I missed the semifinals, so I would be just lost.
I know it's really bad, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Ok, do not panic. I go.
No, it's my ex-wife Whitney who is outside. I can not take care of her now. This woman is crazy!
Ok I know. Wait. Hi Ross?
Yeah?
Yeah, it's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife, you think now that you can turn her away so we can escape?
What?! No!
Okay, but I have two tickets for the finals of the ballroom.
Listen, I do not think Pheebs. Okay, I will do it. But just because you're a friend.

Well, I-I-I finished with that. Do you want something, Ross? Sports? International? Apartment ads?
I'm going to do sport.
Mine!
Okay. Uh, international.
Ok, listen, I-I know what you're going to say
You two will have very hairy children.
Ok, I did not know you would say that.
Ross! Janice ?!
Okay, wait!
Wait.
Wait.
It's Ross, okay?
This is our friend.
He has obviously gone mad.
He obviously lost his mind.
Look, I
So, are you going to see her again?
Phoebe! Do not put ideas in his head!
I
Damnit Phoebe !!

Hey, should not we ...
Yes, we have ah ... hmm.
Umm, I think you're really, really great ...
Oh my God!
Here we go again.
Why does this happen to me?
Is it something that I broadcast?
Is it my fault?
Or am I just crazy?
I-I-I-I-I-I do not know, I do not know what to say.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back home.

Expect!
Terry!
Please!
Listen, I just lost my other job.
Okay?
You have no idea how much I need this.
Please, help me, for the sake of the good old days.
This poor guy has been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
It is not without hope! Dr. Stryker Ramoray is a miracle worker. Look, he's coming here.
Hello. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
I'm back baby! Hahaha!

This kid really kicked me on the plane.
Well, you pulled her hair.
He took my snack!
I will not do it again!
Okay! Oh God, what do you know? It's really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Right here. The. Okay.
That does not mean anything, does it?
Of course! Only an idiot would carry that kind of thing if you did not have the car! Right?
It is true.
Yes, but only a genius could swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I was there. Yes, I will drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you do not have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! I am in the character! Do you want to talk to him!
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really stinging me.
Okay, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
What?! No, you can not, you can not leave me here with them! We are babysitting!
The babies are asleep, I'm sure everything will be fine for you for a while!
But you can not leave me with them! We are a team! We play a zone! They will triple my team!
There is something plastic in your throat, you have to go to the hospital.
But no, because a doctor will not be able to help him, but he will naturally go through his system in about seven years.
I think it's gum.
I'm sure it's a firearm.
Ok, listen, it really hurts. Let's go.
A real man would not rush to the hospital! No! What would he do, what would Krog do?

It was the only way I could do it
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Do not call us that!
The judge did not let us cancel! Now we have to divorce !! Did a Porsche vomit you?
Hey! It's Porsche !!

Hey darling!
Hey!
There is no return to this sofa!
Why are you reading this? You hate this stuff.
Yes I know, but I thought a blow, you know?
Maybe one of these stories would make me cry and then you would not think I was you know, all dead inside.
Oh that's so nice! Listen Chandler, I do not care if you can not cry, I love you.
Oh, it makes me so hot in my hollow chest of metal.
Stop that!
No, I mean, come on, think about it seriously, we get married, we get up at the altar and I'm like that.
I do not care, because I know you're going to feel everything here.
Yeah?
Of course he is!
What, do you think I would use my son as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
OK sorry.
I have to make a fake Ben.

The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors have eaten all the candies!
Well, either that or um
Joey !!
Yeah?
Have you eaten all the candy from the neighbor ?!
Uh, yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got there, there were only a few pieces left!
Yes, and they spend the whole day. They love it!
They like my sweets? Oh guy !!! I have to do more !!
Hey Mon, you could also do more lasagna, because something may have happened.
Ross! Neighbors have eaten all my candies !!
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a
Sure!
Yes, since you told me this story about this bike, I could not help but think about it.
I mean, everyone should have a-a
Oh my God Ross !!
You like this?
I
Yeah?
Hello darling.
And here's dad!

Here it is! Here it is!
Or?
Where we searched all night!
He is so cute!
Oh, George, drop the towel!
Yeah, let it go! Drop the towel! Please drop it - wowww.

I have to tell you that Bob is awesome.
Yes, is not it?
It's really great to meet a smart, funny guy who has an emotional age beyond eight years.
You know what else? He is amazing in bed.
Sensational. My brother never even told me when he had lost his virginity.
Huh. It's good.

and the miracle was that this little bit of oil that should have lasted just a day, burned for
Eight whole days.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Chanukah today. The end.
Impressive!
Yeah?
My favorite part was when
The armadillo was actually not so
Hey!
Oh.
Wow! It sounds like the burial of the Easter bunny here.
Come on, come on, let's light the candles!
Oh.
Oh.
Okay, I understand why

He says, 'Walking with you gives this strange city the feeling of being at home.'
Yes of course. Good luck!
I leave!! Woo-hoo! I'm fine!! I'm fine!!
Wow! It's exciting, you went to Japan, you made up a woman.
What?
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictional. No?
Why would you say that?
Because you still love Monica.
So you told her there was someone else so she would agree to work with you, so because you think that if you spend a lot of time together, maybe something could happen, and .. .
You're good. You're good!
Yeah, no, I'm pretty intuitive and psychic. It is a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you will not tell him?
Absolutely, oh I promise you. Tell him what?
Thank you so much.
No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive, but my memory is nil.

Excuse me, forgive me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
For God's sake, are you going to let him go? There is no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I understood.
Oh, thanks darling.
No problem. I am looking forward to meeting my friends.
Really?
Yeah.
Do not you think they will judge and ridicule me?
No, no, they will. I'm coming ... uh ...
I can not wait.
I know you?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How are you?
Well, well, I'm a lawyer now.
You can not be a lawyer. You are eight years old.
Look, it was nice to see you. I have to run behind the scenes.
Uh, wait, behind the scenes?
Oh, yes, my firm represents the group.
Ross.
Chandler.
How are you?
Look, do you want to meet the band?
Come on.
So, are you one of those who had fun with my dad?

Do you have respect for your body?
Do not you realize what you are doing yourself?
Hey, you know, I got it with you, your cancer, your emphysema, and your heart disease.
In the end, smoking is cool and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to talk to you.
Really?
He does?
Hey, buddy, what's up!
Oh, she told you about it, huh.
Well, yes, I have one from time to time.
Well, yes, now.
Well, it's not that big ... .. well, it's true, ... Gee, you know, nobody, nobody ever said it like that before.
Okay, thank you!
God, he's good.
If only he was a woman.
Yeah.

Hey, Frank
Look, all right, I know you think I liked this totally evil thing, but I did not do it.
There is someone here who can explain that better than me.
Hi Frank
Hello, Mrs. Knight.
Phoebe is right Frank.
I know it's difficult to hear, but we would have been wrong to do it.
I-I-I was selfish, even if we, we want the same things now, in the future we can not.
Is that right?
Yes, but not only that.
Yes, not only that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do
However.
However. Uh, you are too young to really know what you want.
That's right, exactly.
Okay, it's a goodbye kiss, that's good.
Bye.
Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, you know, you know, it's clearly wrong.
Okay, I decided to let that happen!
Ok, can I just have my bag?
Alright Alright.
.

Oh, look, look.
The last candle is about to go out.
10, 9, 8, 7 ... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48 ...
Thank you.
Thank you.
A little ... spooky without any light.
Bwah-hah-hah!
OK guys, guys? I have the definitive. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah ...
Oh oh oh.
Hi Ross. This is probably not the best time to talk about it, but you have to have a party for Monica.

All this takes a lot of space. Hi, how is it serious to keep Ben in your life?
You have blown them!
Oh, I can not tell you how good it was to watch the crowd and see your face!
I mean ... uh, did you know that you were talking to me?
L was
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Oh my God! I am your
I'd better not find you naked in my hotel room!
Look, I took it too far!

Ok, Monica: The right foot is red.
Could have played
Thank you.
Ok, Pheebs: blue right. Well.
Hello? Oh, Rachel, this is the
Oh ok. Do you want to take my place?
Well. Yes, it's Rachel.
Nooo!
Hello?
Oh, yes, no, I know, I-I did not use it much.
Oh, well, thanks, but it's okay, really.
Green. At the Green light.
I have magic beans. Never ever mind.
Left, left - aww!
Ohhh ... I'm fine.

Hey!
Please tell me that you have received the message!
What message?
The actor who was playing on Mac could not do it, he needed to see you at 2 pm
What?! It is 6 o'clock!
I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
I wrote it on the board, then I went everywhere in New York looking for you!
I went to Ross's house!
I went to the cafe!
I went to any place where they made sandwiches!
Is it the day you die? See-darnit, I shuffleboard that day.
It's what you think.
Well, I mean, what about your grandmother's friends? Would not they have the recipe?
Well, you know, parents in France may know it. My grandmother said she had received the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What was his name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Nestle Tollhouse
Oh, you, the Americans, still boil the French language.
(grabbing a bag of
Yes!! Oh.
I can not believe that I just spent the last two days trying to find the recipe and that she stayed in my closet all the time!
I know! You see it's like that, that's why you burn in hell !!

So, we are decided, not on the plaid, yes on the rose?
Absolutely!
I am so much on board!
Rachel, did not you just light that?
Yes, I did, but you know what? I'm really trying, really trying to reduce, you see? Good luck, Rachel.
In fact, I thought about quitting smoking recently.
Oh, of course, every Sunday night I think I'm resigning, but every Monday morning it's like
Tell me about it!
Well then just stop! We will just leave! Let's stop all!
This seems attractive.
Oh, I could never do it.
Oh, but you could.
You can.
Absolutely!
We can help each other!
We can get - what are these - these patches!
We could be like Patch Sisters!
Oh you know, we really should stop smoking. Ok, let's stop!
Yes! Awesome! Give me those cunts! Give the! Give the!
My late husband gave me this lighter. I am not joking.
OK then!

I'm divorced! I'm only 26 years old and I'm divorced!
Well, maybe it's a contest, you see? Like, collect the five?
Does anyone want to see?
Nooo!
Oh, hey, do not do that! Cut!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, it's so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a fault!
Big deal!
As if Joey creaked endlessly, his joints were not boring?
And Ross, with his over-pronunciation every word?
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
I mean, what's this thing?
... I accept all these faults, why can not you accept me for that?
... Does the snap of the fingers disturb everyone?
Well, I-I could live without her.
Well, is it a little annoying, or does Phoebe shave her hair?
Oh, now, do not listen, Pheebs, I find that endearing.
Oh, you do, do you?
You know, there is nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"Indeed, there is none" ... I should really go back to work.
Yeah, otherwise someone could have what he ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out and the gloves go away.

Awww! Mel Torme is dead.
Joey, this paper looks like a year!
Aw! Does this mean that the
Hey.
Hey.
Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure?
Well no. But, I bet she probably does it.
Probably?
Yes, I do not like that word.
A little what "probably" means.
Yeah, huh.
Yeah, oh, "Your mother is probably not going to kill herself," you see?
I'm sorry, but I do not dare to hope that Rachel and I live together "Probably!"
You know?
You must take care of yourself!
In
Bing does not seem so weird now, does it?

Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to greet his future wife.
Ohhh! Wow! It takes your breath away, does not it?
He is a guardian. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
May I just say that I really admire what you do. I lift it alone.
Oh, I do not do it alone. I have Ross.
Oh, of course. Now. But what happens when he meets someone and gets married?
Well, he gets the divorce, it's Ross!
I tell you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say that they will be there until they found their true family.
Well, it will never happen with Ross.
Oh that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my child spends the weekend with his father, the twins and the little Ms. New Boobs.
Okay.
And Tim, I just want to say, good luck here.

Hey. Who is it?
New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
They will have their baby!
It's not fair Ross we came here first!
Just after you left, they took her to the delivery.
Oh, but not before, she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie crowing.
Wow! Sorry. So, how are the new members?
Phoebe?
Yeah?
Look at this guy out the window, wow!
He is terribly small and I think he is talking to himself. And to be quite honest, he is not so good at bed.
Oh, what's wrong with me lately?
I mean it's like all the guys I see - I mean, look here.
Look at this guy, for example, I mean, normally, this is not a person who would seduce me, but for the moment, with what I feel, all I want is to rip off his sweatpants and his banana bag.
Wait a second! It's about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yeah.
It's completely normal, around the fourth month, your hormones start to go crazy.
Really?! So it happened to you?
Oh absolutely yes!
Oh, and keep in mind, now I was wearing triplets so, you know, in medical terms, I was three times more excited.
Wow! That explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store, sitting on Santa's lap.
Yeah. Yes, I remember trying to steal Evander Holyfield's cardboard cutout at a

Ugh!
I do not know what I'm going to do!
I called the company that sent and they do not care!
Then I called 9-1-1 and they made fun of me. If it's not an emergency, then what is it?
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
And the guys at work had a lot of fun.
You know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
Yeah!
And-and another had never been to a party, so
So, uh, this wedding ring, huh? Dude, that's nice!
Yes indeed!
I was uh, I thought I might want to take one of these babies for myself, I might want to have one
This ring? When my grandmother arrived for the first time in this country, this ring and her clothes were all she had with her.
So, you could say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh absolutely! It's been part of my family for generations and every wife who has wore it has had a long and happy life.
So, you could say, it's a magic ring.
OH MY GOD!! I did not believe it so much that you did not say it !!

Of course, only one of us can continue to go out with her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now let's look at this objectively, I think I should go out with her
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
It's interesting, but look at this. I date
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
OK OK. It can take a while.
Yeah, we should order food then.
No Joey! Listen, why not, why do not we let it decide? Okay? Hey hey, we're going
It seems right.
Maybe I'll take him to this new French restaurant down the street
Oh yeah, wait a second now!
We will have to set an expenditure limit for the date.
I do not have the money to take him to such a chic place.
Well, sorry, that's what I'm doing dates.
All right, I guess I'll just have to do what I'm doing dates.
So let's decide on the spending limit
Yeah. Uh, a slice of six dollars?
I thought about a hundred.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?

Hello again.
Hey!
Hey!
Thank you so much.
Oh, do not thank me, thanks the moron who never showed up. Ok, I have to go to work.
You want help with that?
Oh, no thanks, I got it. No, I do not do!
Whoa! Are you OK?
Phew! Remained standing, I had a little head forward.
It's the heat. And-and moisture.
It's a difficult combination.
Do you want to come for a lemonade?
As if you did not believe it. Wow! It is a splendid place.
What do you mean?
Do you remember how you said you were really dense in poetry? Oh.

Oh!
Hey, someone left his keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Transcriber's note: Oh come on!
Who would leave the keys of their Porsche behind?
If I had a Porsche, I would have the keys attached surgically by hand!
Hey Gunther, yours?
Yes, that's what I drive. I earn four dollars an hour, I saved 350 years!
Na-uh! Hey, did anyone lose their keys?
Joey, why do not you put them in the lost and found items?
Is there a lost and found? My shoe!
You left a shoe here ?!
Well, I did not realize until I was at home.
I would not stay here again with only one shoe!
You know what?
I'm going to get that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh well, when he comes back for his keys, I will not fail to give him your shoe.
Awesome! Thank you.

Ok, and here's Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he will not sleep.
Carol, we've had that experience before, okay?
We have a good time.
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Do not be so surprised. I am an adorable person.
Oh it's very cute.
Oh, I got it for him.
My moms love me. It's clever.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Ju - Hi, Jew!
Huh huh?
Huh huh?
Okay. Uh, of course, that would be great.
So see you.
Goodbye.
You just said hello, Jew?
Yes. Um yes. It was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yes, he likes that. Reaffirm his faith.

Now here it is! I would not want my best guest to tire my eyes!
Thank you Monica!
Does this smell bother you?
What is Joey's smell? No, I can hardly feel it here.
Well, let me know if you can, because you know I can make a pie to cover.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay!
Okay.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Oh! Hello? Yeah it's Phoebe. Really?!
Yes, then it turns out that it was not the straightener that started the fire.
No, no, it was the candles.
It's really not good to leave candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you at the fire school is Uhh Uhh Ok.
Well, I have to go now.

Joey offered me.
Is he crazy ?! You just had Ross's baby!
Well, I said yes.
What?!
Are you insane?
You just had Ross's baby!
It's so inappropriate.
No, it's worse than that.
It's wrong.
It's ... bigger than mine!
I know.
You can not marry him!
Why not? I do not want to do this alone! And he's an adorable guy and he loves me a lot.
Well do you like it?
Sure.
Sure?
Yeah, I mean anything.
Honey, the question is ... do you really want to marry Joey?
No, I do not do it. Could you be a dear and go tell him?

So you were married, huh? What happened? You have just separated?
Here is the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
I want to wear this everyday.
You are so Beautiful.
I am so happy for myself.
Hello?
Hey! Is Chandler already here?
Yes, we got it back. Everything is fine.
Damn it!
Uh, what do you know?
I'll tell you who it hurts!
It hurts the kid who is robbed all his clothes in gym. He must go to the office of the principal with a protective glove!
It was
I will be! Listen, I do not want you to teach this to my son anymore. Okay?
Well.
Well, but I'll let you know that once I told him that, he called me Funny Aunt Rachel.
And I loved to be Aunt Rachel's fun but I will become boring and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel again if that's what you want!
No, that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you were linking up but I
Look, he does not have any brothers or sisters, someone will have to teach him that!
And I did not teach him anything that a normal 6-year-old does not know!
Shit!!
I have to go!

Look at this! Look at this! They go to the first class salon! Do you know what they have there?
No.
Neither do I! We must enter!
Act as if you belonged.
Oh my God! Oranges!
Hush! Nice to see you again.
Sir, can I see your tickets please?
Yes of course.
I'm sorry, do you want to move your thumb? I do not see the seat number.
Oh it's ok, I memorized it. It is 1A.
Okay. Mrs. Green! Ok I'm really sorry !! I apologize for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm

Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How does the birthday girl feel?
I feel good, but I think you disgust the rest of the children.
What?
Okay!
You know what?
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and children.
All I really needed was a plan.
See I want to have three children
Oh, let me guess, and you want to have them all at the same time and you want to have them for your brother.
As I said, I should probably have the first of three children at age 35, which gives me five years.
I like this plan!
I want to marry this plan!
You spent a hundred dollars. It's the limit. You're screwed!
Uh, actually, I sent the flowers before the exact date. So technically,
Oh oh! So that's how it's going to be eh? Yeah, I can break the rules too!
Oh yes? What are you going to do?
I do not know.
Why am I not surprised?
You know what Ross? I will not let you get away!
I do not think you have a lot of choice.
Well, we'll see!
Bye!
Yeah goodbye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Yes. Yes. Just here and there.

Dad?
I am here!
Hey!
Hi. God, it looks like yesterday you were coming to watch me work.
Dad, we can not believe you're selling the house.
Well, it's time for a new family to start her memories here and I hope her check will be cleared before finding the crack in the foundation and asbestos in the ceiling.
Let's take our business and get out of here.
I'm sorry, we can no longer store your childhood stuff.
Oh, it's good, I can not wait to see you again! All memories
Well, I do not know what's in the boxes here, but I know there are six or seven
I used to
Yeah, not as much as you enjoyed playing with a raw dough eater.
Hey, it's unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a

Ok, the duct is open.
Hi my name is ben I am an employee of the hospital, Ben. It's Ben ... to the rescue!
Well, are you ready?
Okay, give me your foot.
Ok, on three, Ben.
One two Three.
Ok, that's it, Ben.
What do you see?
Well, Susan, I see what seems to be a dark vent. Expect. Yes, it's actually a dark vent.
Phoebs, it's open! It is open!
Expect! You forgot your legs!

Your resume is very impressive, Mrs. Green. I particularly like what I see here about setting up a new filing system.
Thank you.
Deposit system?
Oh oh!
You mean those little colorful labels that you put on all the folders?
This certainly illuminated the interior of the binders.
Well, they ... they do more than that.
I notice that many important responsibilities have been assigned to you.
Yes, Joanna has really been an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel was really amazing with my morning bagel. It's amazing how she almost succeeds
I-I-of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh yes, well there is coffee too. Rachel can wear two things at once!
Yes it's very good. Much of this work involves maintaining personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that
And Rachel should not have a problem with that. The only problem is maybe a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
I like working with designers!
With them, beneath them, what's the difference? Hey, Rachel?

Chandler, you have an assistant, right?
Did she call? You told him I was sick, did not you? Always tell him I'm sick!
Chandler, listen to me honey, I know you can do it. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yeah! Okay, maybe you do not have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try, let's try to look sexy.
Okay.
Or not.

Where is Chandler?
I am here.
Wash your hands !!!
How did you know?
Hey! What is she doing here?
Relax, Ross. It is not made of ice!
Hey, look, Phoebe. I arranged the states geographically ...
What happened in Atlantic City ?!
Chandler and I are in a bar
You did not hear me say, "Du-ude ?!"
And that girl's eyes on Chandler, okay?
So after a while, he goes to her and, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
Now, I know what you're thinking about, Chandler is not the type of guy who goes to bars and gets out with girls, and you're right, Chandler is not the kind of guy who just goes into bars and who does not care about girls
You kissed a guy? !! Oh my God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very nice guy.
Oh my, I laughed so much
Ho-ho, so hard that we had to throw your underwear again?
Whatever the guy, you kissed a guy.

So, are you going to stay with me as long as I need you?
Of course I am!
Oh mum, I swear I'm not an idiot.
I read all kinds of books about pregnancy and childbirth, but I did not think about reading about what to do when the baby was coming.
And then guess what?
The baby is coming and I do not know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
Honey, it's okay.
Wait where are you going? Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Okay.
Now do not worry! Everything will be alright.
he
Hey!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I'm from Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not a sexual thing. It was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.

Ok, the reason I asked you to take brunch today is because I'm thinking about who should be my bridesmaid.
Oh my God! That's it ...! I really hope it's you!
I hope it's you.
Me too!
First of all, I love you so much both and you are both so important to me
Okay, blah-blah-blah-blah !! Who is it?!
Well, uh, I thought maybe we could develop a system in which we would exchange bridesmaids for each other.
As hypothetically, if Phoebe was mine
Yes!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
Again.
If Phoebe was my bridesmaid
Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's, like we'll all do it once and no one would get upset.
Yes, it's a very good idea.
Yes, I will do that. So who can be yours?
Well, it's the best part. Umm,
Why is this the best part?
Because then I do not have to do it!
Good of
I really do not decide!
Well!
Yes, it's true.
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!

If you want to give Joey a Christmas gift that disturbs the entire building, why not give her something more subtle, like a wrecking ball or a small pyre of fungal pills to free up the hallway?
It's not just the drum sound.
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
Oh my god, my eye! "
I mean, it's so annoying.
Yes thanks. You see, that's how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Phoebe, do you have Joey's battery to annoy Rachel, so she would not want to live there anymore?
Maybe at a certain level.

Joey? Could you get it? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, I'm coming to get you for our appointment. These are for you.
Oh, Lilies. Joey, they are my favorites. Thank you.
And a brownie!
Well, half a brownie.
In fact, it's just a bag.
The flower shop took a long walk and I started to feel bad, so
Oh man!
It's awesome!
In fact, I feel like I'm going to a real date!
Although I have a hint of morning sickness, I wear underwear that goes pretty much over there.
Hey come on now, it's a real date.
Uh, it's a nice place you have here.
Foosball, huh?
Pizza box.
Oh, a subscription to
Yes, it's actually my roommate.
I would like to meet him. He looks like a guy standing up.
Oh yes, but he's very protective of me, so you better look at yourself.
Ah, so is your roommate handsome?
Hm-mmm.
Oh yeah, it must be hard to keep his hand, huh?
Yes, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
No-no-no-no, he is not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!

Can you believe what Ross was a fool?
Yeah, I know. It can be really competitive.
Ha. Ha, ha.
What?
Oh, hello, kettle? It's Monica. You are black
Please! I'm not as bad as Ross.
Oh, please delay. the
It was
Oooooh. : Oh! I had an interview! I had an interview!
Well, do not play raquetball!
He forgot to leave his handle size!
He did not have the glasses!
Looks like you have problems.
Good bye Baby.
Ciao, Bela.
Do they wait for me to do that?
So are you going to tell him?
Why should I tell him?
And if you do not do it, his mother could do it.
Oh...
What are you guys doing here?
Uhhhh .... he does not even wear a jockstrap!
... what did I ask?

God. I feel violated.
Did anyone else feel that he just wanted to take off the skin from his body, have something else to do?
Ross, ten o'clock.
Does it feel like two.
No,
What?
There is a beautiful woman at eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten o'clock!
Oh. Hello!
She is incredible! It makes the women I dream of look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go see her! She is not with anyone.
Oh yes, and what would be my first line? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.
Oh come on. It's a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she
He could never have a woman like that in a million years.
Thank you my friend.
Oh, oh, but you know, you still see these really beautiful women with these guys really nothing, you could be one of those guys
You could do that!
You think?
OK, that's enough of the sight. Look at this, look at that. Sit down, sit down.
OKAY.
It's good! Helen, could you come here for a moment?
Thank you Helen, that will be everything.
The last time I do that, I promise you.

I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh-huh.
And I'll cook whatever you want here and I'll do anything in it!
Yeah you go! And you do not care about me ?!
Come on Monica, this is our Valentine's Day. Please? Please please please?
Okay.
Okay.
So, are we going there?
I am!!

Wow!
It's actually in the manual.
I can not go out with you or have a hot plate in my office.
I can not believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I appreciated that you defended me. It was really good. It made me a little more like you.
I know, I know that I really love you too. But we can not go out together. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Wow!
What?
Hearing that you describe as forbidden, it's really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well I-I-I do not care about the heat it does - it's uh, it's wrong
Stop that!
No! No! It's wrong! That's-it's-nasty. It's taboo.
Close the book!
Let's get a hot plate too!

Rachel, you're in a good place in your life. Come on, you have a good job! Good friends
Yeah! If-if when are you going to get married?
Oh I'm not, I just like trying these.
I do the same thing.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married on July 25
I'm kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
So when are you going to get married?
Oh May 15th
Oooh it's getting closer!
Yeah!
So who is your photographer?
Jeffery
We met him. Did he show you the pictures of the nude wedding he did?
The best man? Wow!
I know! I almost canceled my marriage. Oh, who is your group ?!
Oh, my fiancée wants the Swing Kings.
Oh, you are so lucky. My fiancée wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Ooh, is it written with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It does not matter they are both great!
Oh you know what?
You know what?
Now that you know what you want, you should go to Kleinman's and do it at half-price.
This place is so expensive.
So, does that come in another color or

I tell you, in a few years, schoolchildren will study it as one of the biggest first dates of all time.
It was amazing!
We could be totally ourselves, we did not play any games ...
So you already called her?
Tell him I like him?
What are you crazy?
It's the next day!
How much do I want to appear?
I'm right, right?
Oh yes. Yeah. Let her hang.
I can not believe that my parents force me to find one of you.
Oh, my God, do it! Call her! Stop being so testosterone!
Which is also the real treat of San Francisco. I have his machine.
His answering machine?
No, oddly enough, his leaf blower picked up.
So, why did not you say anything?
Oh no no no no The last time I left a spontaneous message, I ended up with the phrase "Yes Yes".
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, not everyone is watching at the same time!
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Okay, they just talk ...
Yeah, does he look upset? Does he look like someone who just told him to push anything?

So, what are you doing in life?
Well, uh, in the last few years, I'm working ..... which is funny because it was not even my middle finger.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot without you.
I thought they could ... I will try to come back as soon as possible. I am sorry.
Now it's funny.
Hey, do you think ... that it would be too weird if I invited Carol to join us?
Because she is, she is alone now, pregnant and sad.
I suppose.
Are you sure? Awesome. Carol? Do you want to come join us?
Oh no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on.
These people will go down.
You're going to squash, are not you?
Let's try scooching!
Come on.
Come on.
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches grade six.
And Kristin, Kristin ...... does something that, oddly enough, was not even her major!

Okay.
Okay.
When I was six years old.
Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel.
And instead, my parents bought me that little plastic chicken on which you jump.
It was embarrassing; the children were making fun of me.
It was a pretty difficult year.
It's awesome!
See?
I already feel that I know you a little better!
Thank you.
Ok, come on.
Now we can go eat.
Let's go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!

Do you want to choose one, just choose one! Here, what about that one?
It's patio furniture!
So what, as if people were going in and thinking, "Uh-oh, I'm out again?" Of course!
What about birds?
I do not know, the birds just do not say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
You choose one.
Okay, what about ladybugs?
Oh, forget the birds, but the big red insects suggest a fine dinner!
Very good, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I will not do it! Kip would have liked birds!

Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?
Bijan for ... Hey, Annabelle, uh, listen, I was wondering if after work, we could go for coffee.
Oh, in fact, I have some projects.
Ready, Annabelle?
You bet. Maybe another time?
Hey, it's not the first time I've lost a girl because of a cowboy who sprays cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men ?!

It was amazing!
Phoebe and Gary are
It was great.
We are the hottest! Huh?
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
I
Hi guys! What did I do?
Hey Joey! Is not it the girl who beckoned you the other day?
How are you'?

So, what are you going to do?
What can I do? A person wants to break, you break.
Hey, no question! Come on, you guys are, call her and solve her.
Oh come, we just had this huge fight, okay, do not I have to wait for a moment?
Hey, it's not like swimming after eating, pick up the phone !!
You know that all this swimming history is a myth.
Yes, tell my uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, he really believes in it.

It seems that your uterus is ready to be implanted.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Okay, so what's going on now, get the eggs, put them in there.
Well, it'll take a little time to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? Like in, "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five in fact.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We do five because it gives you a 25% chance that at least one is getting attached.
That's all! 25 percent? This means that it's as if 75% of the chances of not having a baby at all!
Hey, you know, I was wondering, what are the chances if-if, if you have 200 like that?
Sweety, now, it's a woman, not a rubber machine.
Ok, well you know what, do not worry guys, because I-I'm going to do that as many times as I need to do it right.
Well, you see, the thing is, we only have what we have, we sort of have a chance to do it right.
Uh, it costs $ 16,000 every time you do that.
So, uh, we use a little bit of all the money we have to do it this time only.
Whoa !! It's okay, it's a
No I am sorry.
Wow! You really do not know anything!
I know! Why do not you get drunk? It worked for many girls in my high school.

Sorry. So how are things with Joey?
Oh just great.
He is now behing me with codes.
One is, "Bring me food."
Two: "I'm with a girl, bring us some food."
Three is "I am lost and I can not find food."
Hey! Are you okay?
Yeah! She's right there!
Oh great. Hey! Go take off these pants, they look ready!

Hey!
Hey!
You have something to eat guys? I just went to Johnos for chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry there but everything was raped. So we closed it!
Pheebs, if this guy does not stop closing all our favorite places, where are we going to eat?
I do not know, clean places?
Hum, yum!
It's Danny.
Do not let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We will be there! Can not you say it starts later?
What? What kind of regatta gala starts at night ?!
The wrong kind!
Hi, I need a ladle. You have a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thank you, we see each other at the party.
Okay! Great!
Hey, guys, do you know what Larry would say? He said: "A ladle".

You are so effective. I love you!
Let's go!
No no no! We need something old!
Oh, great, I have a condom in my wallet since I was twelve.
It's going to work!
I do not think so.
Ok, now we just need something borrowed!
Here are just this.
It's flying!
No, we will report it! Just put it under your dress.
Ohh
Ok, one thing at a time.

Sorry about that. So. What have you done?
Oh, not much. I have a job.
Oh that's great.
Why are you so tanned?
Oh, I went to Aruba.
Noooo! I lie. I'm so drunk.
Oh my God, oh.
Great, Monica, you know, you could have called, I came here, I'm worried ...
Monica? Monica!
Rules of the water!
Yes, yes, it is. Ok, listen, the restaurant called, they want to know if you'll come to work?
Nope. To go to the
Ok Monica, what are you doing? You will lose your job! It's not you!
No it's me!
You know, I'm not just the person who has to eat the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they arrive!
You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that.
I am Monana!
Hello? Yes, wait a second, please. Monana is for you, credit card people.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thank you.
What?
They arrested Monica.

Note the pictorial lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and generally outside, his elusive subject being in the light.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain thinks of monster trucks!
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
I come ...
I wrote it phonetically for you.
Phonetically?
Yeah, that means ... you know? We just ... we do not have time for that.
Okay.
Ok, but you know what? I must say that I am really impressed that you could memorize all this so quickly!
Ah! I am an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week, during "Days", I had to say "frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Sensational. what
No idea!
But the guy I told to die in the next scene so I guess it means "you're going to be eaten by a bear".
Okay! Let's move on to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to emphasize the anxiety of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! Not ad-libbing and dude, you can not
Come on! you...
No!

Oh. Oh oh.
Hey! What happened to you? Why did not you go up?
Completed!
You just finished?
Well, I wanted to be thorough.
I mean this - this is clearly very, very important to you, for us!
And so I wanted to read each word carefully, twice!
So, uh, right?
I am sorry.
Does he do it?
Does he do it? Does he do it? Yeah, I wanted to give all that separate just another look.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said you read it twice!
Look, you know what, whether or not, and if you even
No, Rachel, no. I do not do I do not do
Are you sure?
Oh, of course! I am on.
I know.

You got married again.
Yes.
This is your second marriage in two years.
Yes, second in two years. Third in all.
Ross, I've been a divorce lawyer for 23 years and I've never had so much to do with one client.
Why do not you tell me what happened?
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
I'm sorry, did the same Rachel call you to the altar at the second wedding?
Yes Yes Yes! But I do
Oh, it's better then.
It was just a drunken mistake and I need to cancel it.
I see. Have you considered a therapy?
I think the
There are some forms to complete.
Easy.
And we will need witnesses to testify that you were not sane.
No problem.
And we will need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ooh!
There is no way to do that without her?
Because I'm ready, I told him it was already settled.
No!
Okay.

Phoebs owes $ 7.50, Monica, $ 10, and Rachel, 15 big.
But hey, thank you for teaching us Mary with crossed eyes. You have to play this at our usual game.
Well, here is my $ 7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Oh, I cursed him. So now, bad things will happen to the one who spends them.
It's good, I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.
In this way, I can break them with a movie.
Well, all that's left is the big green poker machine, which owes fifteen ...
Ah! Huh?

Do you want to do it now?
Awesome!
Ok, I just want to be really safe this time. Andie McDowell is the daughter of
No No No No No No It's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from
Oh yes. Ok thank you.
You are welcome.

is for me not to see you anymore.
It's crazy!
You can not do that!
What are you going to tell him?
Oh my God.
Ohh, you've already accepted that, have not you?
It's awful, I know, I mean, I feel very bad, but I have to do it if I want my marriage to work.
And I do it, I have to do
Ohh! I'm lucky! Oh my God! This
You have no idea what a nightmare is. It's so difficult.
Oh yes really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Well, let me simplify your task.
What are you doing?
On the way!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yeah, well that's how I'm angry !!

These little women. Wow!
You like it, huh?
Oh yes! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I do not see how he could forgive him.
Umm, Jo is a girl, it's a shortcut for Josephine.
Chandler.
Hi.
Hi.
Joey.
Eh eh!
Hey.
It's Monica.
Whoa!
And it's Rachel.
Hi!
Whoa !!
I am going to get coffee.
Hey, how are you doing something?
We do not really.
So, now, do you have a lot of big plans?
Oh yes! Yeah, no, we'll connect, you know, and everything.
Yeah, I thought maybe we could go to Time Square and look for some ninja stars.
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a bitch.
You know, we do not really enjoy life in the city.
I know.

Ok, Chandler!
Okay.
And your horoscope says, "The fifth, a special person will give you a present."
Oh, thank you in advance.
Op, but the twelfth brings the spat of a lover.
Oh, wait and the 19th, a secret crush is announced.
Hi guys!
Hey !!
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!!!!!!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So, are you excited to fight crime with the help of your robot?
Am I excited? Lead in my own TV series? I've been dreaming for years! Why do not I get ready ?!
No! Joey, you'll be great!
But I have to play with a Pheebs robot, and-and I do not know anything about technology!
I can not even use Chandler's computer, except to find porn!
And-and that's only because it's right there when you turn it on!
I think our lover's spat will begin earlier this month.
I'll wait.

We are at the last minute and I apologize for the mess. Okay?
Oh my God! It certainly did not look like that when I lived here.
I know!
Now, look, there is only one problem though.
There is only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Well, since the fire was a bit my fault, I guess you should be able to stay here.
Hey! Hey, hey, now it was nobody's fault, Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Well no, it was my fault, so you should have the nice room.
Okay!
So Rachel!
You are the first guest at the Monica hotel!
Uh, you just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.
And I thought I'd bring them to you, you know, in bed.
Oh, you have gone through so much.
I have.

This is just Bactine. It will not hurt.
Sorry, it was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Why not just put "poor little Tooty" in the lobby?
During a power failure? He would be trampled!
Yeah?

Well, I want you to know that it may happen that I'm not there, like that.
But I will always come back like that.
And sometimes I can be away longer, like that.
But I will always come back like that.
And sometimes, I want you to steal third place, and I'm going like that.
He is so amazing.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Ben, Ben, hi Ben. Nothing. I do not think it's his name.
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he opens his eyes.
It does not do much, does it?
No, that's about it.
You want to have a coffee?
Yeah.
Okay, see you later.
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
Come on, they'll love you.

Here you are.
Oh my God! It's a six-hour pill! That's all! I came out of the wood! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
Oh, it's like a huge weight has been lifted!
Because look, no hair loss, no rash, no hives, I'm so happy!
Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.

Well, thanks for the lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I did not pay, I thought you paid!
So, apparently, we are not paying for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
How was it?
Had the money in the wrong hand.

Okay, I'm going to steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility to make sure nothing happens to him?
I will do it.
Who wants it? Anybody?
I said I will do it!
Nobody wants to do it? Okay, I'll do it myself.
Monica! I will not ruin everything!
You know what?
You're right, I'm sorry.
In fact, you have been a big help tonight.
Yes, and thank you for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure that she is at the hotel.
Of course, that's why I'm here!
Okay. Sorry.
Ugh! What grandmother?

Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today, is that correct?
Yes, at 4:00.
Ok thank you.
That's it.
Expect!
Expect!
Have you seen that?
This mail did not know that something was happening between us.
You saw my huge pile of porn, right?

Hi Monica, it's Chip.
Yesss !!
Who is Chip?
Hush!
I'm giving you my good shots at the bank today, so here's my number 555-9323. Call me. Later.
Chip, it's Chip Matthews.
The guy who took Rachel to prom? Why is he calling you?
Because I met him at the bank, he is still too cute.
Monica, you are so lucky! He is like the most popular guy at school !!
I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay goodbye. Oh my God, we just had
I had just left.
Well! Because I have a report on the product to read, it's about eight pages, I hope I do not fall asleep.
Why? Have you written it?
Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Well, actually ...

Here is your tea Phoebe.
It is so good. Oh thank you.
Well.
I'm glad you liked it.
Oh!
What?!
What?! She made tea!
Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
You what?
Oh my God!
I like it. She sees smart.

I have no idea, could be. Look, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oh no problem. You were worth the wait, and I'm not just talking about tonight.
I actually
: Yeah, well your friends are in violation.
I've been a nice guy so far, but uh, I do not need that grief.
I will call the owner and tell him that Monica illegally sublets her grandmother's apartment.
Your friends are out of here buddy.
Why do not you tell me something I do not know!

Okay! I found the right one!
You know what they say, on the 23rd
Who's is this?
Oh that's important! All that matters is that you are so beautiful.
Oh, damn it!
No! Do not say that! Do not say that!
Damn it!
No no! Go back to repeat!
Damn it!
Oh shit!
Oh shit!

Hi Rachel! Hey, do you mind if I read my comics here?
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are there and it's a bit difficult to focus.
What?!
She just called and said she would work late!
She continues to lie to me!
That's all!
You know what?
I'm just going to go there and confront them now!
So Chandler, I'd love to come tonight.
Really?
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, about seven o'clock?
Yes.
Well. I can not wait for you and me to have sex.
Hey hey, take a look! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!

Why not talk about it during dinner?
Ok lady, you are out of here.
No! No, you can not stop me! No!! I will not go back! I will not go back to this hell !!
I'm just taking you outside!
Oh ok.

Hey!
Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that can make you want to stay married. We register and
No!
Ross, come on!
No!
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about how to tell you this, and the bottom line, Ross, is that we can not stay married.
I do not know if that's true.
Oh b-b-but that's the case!
Oh, ok, do you know what it is?
Oh Ross, come on! It's not, it's not a wedding !! It's the worst hangover in the world! Ross, listen, if
Okay. Okay, I will do it.
Thank you. Hey-hey uh, uh, is there, is there such a thing as a cancellation shower?

Hey! What are you guys doing?
Hey.
Make holiday candy for the neighbors.
Yes!
So, did I really ever win again?
How much have you really won before?

He is so cute. So where did you grow up?
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
How, how did this happen?
Oh my God.
What?
I suddenly had the feeling of falling. But I am not.

Thank you.
It was very nice Ashley.
No no.
So, is it my turn now?
I am next!
Oh!
Obviously they do it.
What?!

Ok, I pause, I go through the window.
No no no no! I waited like, always, to go out with Lorraine. Relax a little.
Calm down? Calm down? You prepare me with the woman I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Can you stop shouting? You make me nervous and I can not go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go for it !!!

Hey guys, guess what?
The British arrive?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since Christmas I will be part of these gifts of collection.
Yes, I already have my bell and later ... I get my bucket.
Ohh
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be there to spread the joy of people.
I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not enough.
So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was
I can not
Oh! Look, the time is up! My turn!
It was half an hour?
It's your timer.
You know, I do not like boasting, but I give the
Okay, so mass me nice!
Ah! Ahh !! Ahh !!
It's so good, is not it?
It's so good that I do not know what I did to deserve it!
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Farewell muscles !!

Oh whoa-whoa-whoa!
Wait a minute, open your hand; Let me look.
Quarter.
Dime.
Plush?
Not interested in that.
What is this?
A Canadian coin?
Get out of there!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
No drinks near the bucket!
Put it there and then you can contribute!
And you can also let the injured rabbit look there!
Hi Bob!
I thought I told you to get out of here!
Phoebe, we had complaints and we will take you to a less known place.
Well, because we thought you knew !! It's so obvious! My God, it would be like saying to Monica, "Hey, you like cleanliness."

Hi Joe! Do you want to shoot hoops?
Oh no, I can not go. I practice; I had an audition to animate a new game show.
Oh cool!
It's awesome.
Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day, I'll be Dr. Drake Remoray, but in the evening I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
You will be perfect for that! It's already your name!
But the audition is in a few hours and I do not even understand the game.
Do you want help?
Oh really? That would be great! You can be the candidates!
Impressive!
Okay, I guess we can lose once again to high school girls.
Okay! Let's play Bamboozled!
Bamboozled?
Yeah, it's not a cool name?
Yeah!
No!
Oh. Ok, just breathe.
Oh honey, I think I have one too!
Look at this! Here we are!

Excuse me. Hello, I am a teacher here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, pile 437?
Well yes! Give me just five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No! No!! No! Can I talk to someone in charge please ?!
How can I help you?
Hello, I was wondering if it was possible to increase safety in the paleontology section?
I see that I have written a book there and instead of reading it, people are-well-being, rolling in front of them.
We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
But in terms of strengthening security, I'm afraid the library is understaffed.
I, I can not help you.
Well.
Well!
If I am the only person who appreciates the sacredness of writing, I will go and defend it and defend it myself!
And do not follow me!

Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant or in his shower drain?
Oh my God! Phoebe looks, it's Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look at this! It's a line of ants! They work as a team!
Phoebe!
Yes Yes.
Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
Uff, I hope he drops it easily.
Let's go.
Go Phoebe, look at that!
They do not separate, look at them.
Ok, you know what it is?
It's a second date, that's it!
Look at this, she just put her hand on her thigh ...
Oh no! It's really nothing, she's
Ohh! Phoebe, it's all your fault! Now he loves her, he's going to marry her, and it's your fault.
You know where I work!
I do?
The movie theater, you came all the time.
Do you still work at the multiplex?
Oh, as if I was giving up this job! Free popcorn and sweets, when I want. I can have free posters for your room.
Thank you, I'm ready. Do you still live with your parents?
Oh yes, but I can stay out as late as I want.

Beautiful car!
Yes, it's not mine.
I like your car
Yes, it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do you like leather seats?
Yeah!
He has them!

Joey, please!
Sorry.
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Hello children!
Hey! Do you want to play table football? Please?
Okay.
No no no! We have to move the table to my room, yes! Because of all the boxes. Come on!
Okay, I have a question.
Farewell to the little puppet Joey?
No, calm!
You mean that?
Um-hmm! Listen, I-I-I do not know how much more I can bear! Did you know that he registered on my
Look, you know, maybe it's hard, but it's Ross! I survived college with him!
Okay, I guess I can hold a little longer. Let's have a game
Okay.
No no no no!
YES!!
Uh guys,
Ok, so he came out of here.
Ok, you know what, because you said that, I'm not going out tonight.

I know it does not make much sense
A lot
Look at Chandler, it was instinctive! Okay? I just went for that!
So you risked your life for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler is the best sandwich in the world!
So you did not choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You are like my brother!
Really?!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you count for me here.
Thank you.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
That's good?
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?
Mm-hmm.
Oh-whoa-hey, man, what are you doing ?!
I thought you were showing me how much you meant to me.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!

Look at the ring.
Pleasant! A half-carat easy.
Hi.
Hey hey Pheebs!
What?
Chandler will ask Monica to marry him!
Oh I know, I helped choose the ring.
Did you tell him before telling us?
Well, she came in when I was looking at the ring's brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?

Let's see.
The Congress is debating a new bill on deficit reduction ... the mayor still wants to raise metro rates ... today, he peaked at forty-five ... and, oh, the teams have played sports.
And for Glen? He could be a Glen.
Nah ... not special enough.
Ooh! What about Agamemnon?
Waaay too special.

Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I ?!
Wow! Pleasant! Manly and also a kind of slut.
You see, I'm starting to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh-huh.
The silk? Feels really good!
Oh yes, sorry for that.
It's okay. Come come.
Thank you for letting me stay here! I mean, Monica's house was nice, but her fiancee is watching a lot.
Oh.
Oh my God! You make a good Chandler!
Uh-huh. Yes, I have a talent for impressions.
Well, maybe after we get to know you, you can do it.
Yeah no !!

Hey! Guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess what work I had.
I do not know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer to be black.
What?
Blue blazer at the back. He wants to get it back.
But you said you black. Why would he want his black blazer?
Well, you know what I meant.
No, you ruined everything. You are stupid.
So, what job did you find Joe?
Oh, ah, guide to the museum. Yes, Ross got it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, do not you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
I just walked into the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like a torture!
You know, if we ever go to war and you're captured, you'll have a
It only gets worse!
You know?
I mean, it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate friend, which I think she knows.
Because every time we are in the same room, there is this strange energy between us.
And call me crazy, but I think she loves me too.
And now I saw her naked.
I mean at least when I saw her dressed, I could imagine that her body was like covered with drums or something.
But there are no barrels, it is smooth!
Smooth!
Wow! Could everyone see her dress?
Yeah! Oh my God!

So you and Angela, huh?
Yes. Rather.
Oh, that's what she meant!
You know, if they shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!
You know, museum abbreviation, and avoid confusion!
Yes, most is a place
Ok, all right, I'll take him to MET.
Yeah, uh, all right, there's this big, rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.
You know what?
She likes architecture, you know what you should do?
You should take a fifth stroll to St. Patrick's Cathedral and there is this great little pastry she would like.
Definitely, it looks like you should go on that date!
But I am not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you're going
Okay.
You have to tell me exactly what to do there.
Ok, when you enter the museum, turn right is the wing of antiquities.
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, to the Byzantine Empire.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and do the right

Hey!
Hey, so everything went well with the cancellation?
Oh, yes, no problem. Everything is taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Hey, you want to go see a movie?
Oh yes, why not?
Pheebs?
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Ok, I'll get my sweater.
Okay. Do you want to hear something weird?
Always.
I did not have the cancellation.
What?!
We are still married! Do not tell Rachel. See you later.

Hey! Are you OK?
Fabulous.
Listen, drama critics are nothing but people who have not been able to become actors. Do you know what you should do?
Exactly. So you did not say anything to Issac, did you?
I say everything to Issac.
You say, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hello! You know we have not met yet ...
You dog!
Yes, I guess I'm a dog. But Issac, I see that I have a girlfriend.
Oh yes, this coffee Rachel.
Yes, that's it. Listen, I do not want to hurt her.
Oh, hey, man, I know, no matter how much we love them, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information for yourself?
Aw, no problem guy. You know we have to look at each other. We are the same, you and me.
In fact, no, we are not.
Yes we are.
No we are not.
Yes we are.
No we are not!!
Ok, we are not.
Right.
But we are.
Well. I just need to know you will not tell your sister.
I can promise not to tell him anymore.

Emily!
Oh my God! What are you doing here?
I have just seen you again before you leave.
You're so sweet.
It's a big chocolate bar. (She is holding one of those huge
Me too.
Well, it's me. Here, have this. In any case, I am entitled to only one copy.
Wait, listen.
I-I, I have to tell you something.
Uh, I thought, I'll just go out and say it.
Okay?
I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
Oh. Thank you.
This is not a problem.

Monica!
She sleeps.
I know, just a quick question, a quick question. Which one was
Deep impact
Sorry, I just can not sleep.
Ooh!
Where is this book that you read with the two women who were skating and wearing hats with flowers on them?
Because every time I look at this blanket, I'm like
It's in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking the real estate section, um
Yeah?
Look at this.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house.
Oh, there is even a tree with a broken branch in front and uh, the window in the attic is Oh my God!
!
What? What happened to the attic window ?!
I can not believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I can not believe they - they did not even tell us!
I can not believe I still do not know what happened to the
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I have just seen the house in the newspaper! Yes we are surprised! With whom did you leave a message?
Sorry!

Good then
Nothing?
Look, you and I have received a gift.
Okay?
We have to do something with that.
Like-like, modeling by hand!
Huh?
Or-or magic!
And you
I have to go back to
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa-whoa!
We could have our own show!
You know we could clap our hands, people will love
Huh?
And-and-and I wrote a song for us!
(Singing, to the air of
Its good.
But you did not even hear the chorus!

Well, she'll understand, right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Dad, it will not matter to her.
Look, all my stuff is dry and safe and all his are, is growing, new things!
You see, that's exactly the kind of thing that makes you think that you love me more than you like.
Oh my God, does she really think that?
Well, can you blame her?
Well I do not know, I-I guess we were able to favor you unconsciously, you were a medical wonder! The doctor said that your mother could
Dad, dad, I do not want to hear about it.
Really?
Well, not now.
Ok look, Monica came here for some memories and damn it, we'll give her some!
Ok, grab empty boxes.
Okay?
We will take things in mine and everything we can do for us, we will put them here.
Awesome!
You know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could?
Yeah! I have sailed all my life. When I was fifteen, my father bought me my own boat.
Your own boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.

He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Count in our heads as good
I guess I'm done.
The pleasure is over!
Wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's always fun and it means something!
Uh-huh!
I think I'll take off.
Guys, the rules are good! Rules help control pleasure! Ohhh!

Japanese noodles dehydrated under fluorescent lights ... the fact
Question. You do not go out with anyone, because I met someone who would be perfect for you.
Ah, you see, perfect could be a problem. Did you say "co-dependent" or "self-destructive" ...
Do you want an appointment on Saturday?
Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny
It's a he?
Well yeah!
...Oh my God.
I just thought it was good, Shelley.
I'm just going to throw myself in the toilet now ...
Okay goodbye...

It's official, there are no good movies.
Well, let's go to a bad one and go out.
Maybe you want me to turn around so I can hit my back.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey, man. What's up?
Maybe you can tell me.
My agent would like to know why I did not attend the audition I did not know today.
The first good thing she has won me for weeks.
How could you not give me the message?
!
Well, I'll tell you I like guilt, but, oh, it was not me.
Yes it was! It was him! Uh huh! Ok, it was me!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.

Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy who has a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There is this kid in my class who said he was in love with me.
Whoa!
Whoa what?
Ross has a boyfriend.
I do, I do it
Really?
Yeah!
I do not know.
I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.
What-what-what-what is it ?!
Do I give a kind of sexy teacher atmosphere?
Not immediately.
The fact is that my natural charisma made him fail midway.
Oh, now I feel bad for the kid!
Once I had a crush on a teacher and it was so difficult!
You know, I could not concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
I mean, come on, you remember what it's like to be 19 years old and in love.
Oh yes! Thank you so much! Oh, that's how the French drink it.

A new pair of shoes for Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Yes! I have never seen a roll like this in my life!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Ok, uh, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Choose a number! It's yours
8. 8!
Thank you!
If you get this one, we buy everyone here a steak!
Yes I understand.
Take as much time as you want.
Ten or twenty minutes if you need it.
I will be there.
No smoking.

We're really going to do that, huh?
It looks like it.
You know, if, if it's too weird for you, we can always come back
J? have understood!
Okay.
Susan! Hi!
Hey!
Thank you very much for coming.
Oh, I would not miss that for the world.
I am -I am Ross by the way.
Hello Ross. I like what you did with this space.
Thank you so much.
It is hot?!

Guess who is here. He's the hardest guy in the country of toys, Ben. "A true American hero. I am
G.I. Joe
Ben looks, it's a toy that protects US oil interests abroad!
It took me 28 years to find a man with whom I want to spend my life. If I have to wait another 28 years, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's stupid.
That's what's stupid.
I do not need a real man, just two of his best swimmers.
And there are places where you can go for that kind of thing.
Again on the docks?

Hi. How much, how much ah, did you sell?
I'm not gonna tell you! You are the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Hey now! It was an accident, okay.
You are a big scrud.
What is a scrud?
Why do not you look in the mirror, Scrud.
I do not have too much. I can just watch you.
Very good girls and man. Let's see your final account. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, fine.
Not nice enough.
Charla, 278. Sorry, darling, but good.
So how are the lasagna?
Really?!
Well.
So you owe me three pretty things.
Yes, I thought a lot about you too.
I know.
It's difficult all this platonic thing.
It's a word!
Yes, I think it's better that way. Yes, we are smart. Yes I am sure.
Are you really sure?
I'll call you back.

So, are you really going out with this nurse?
Well, uh, you and I just laugh, I thought, why not gambol with him.
You know, I do not know if you've ever looked at the term in the dictionary doing stupid things. spend more time together.
But if you have this new entangled dictionary that makes you hard, then we have to get my original dictionary.
I am
I think you're better than you think.
Really? Good then
Know when to stop.
You know, I felt I had to stop. So, it's OK?
Yeah. Okay, I'll tell Dan that it will not happen. Do not dance.
Right!

Ow! -Ow! -Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! You know, ow!
Hey! -Hey! What is going on?
She broke my arm.
He touched my fanny.
No, she touched mine first!
It's my job!
Are you British ?!
No more now.
Why are you shopping here? You do not live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party is barley?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends are not as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Who's the party?
A woman's
What woman?
Chelsea.
Ok, you know, one of two things is happening here.
Either you see someone behind my back, which would make you the biggest fool on the planet.
Or, you pretend to see someone, which makes you so pathetic that I could start crying here in the grain aisle.
So, which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be this guy?

Beautiful story again! The threads you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
You know, actually I should go.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-should-you-should-stay!
Sensational. Oh, I'm really flattered, but I do not feel that for you.
Oh no-no-no, it's not-no-no-no!
You just whipped me?
OK, you would not let me finish and I was just- [Monica rejects it] Ow. It hurts [plays Monica]
Oh! Okay. Now, do not do that!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
OK, now I'm going to kick ass.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
I know! I know! I know!
Okay, now I'll let go if you both stop.
Well!
Well!
There we are. You know what, if you were in prison, you would be like my dogs.
Ok, buddy. It's here. You hide my clothes, I wear everything you own.
Oh my God!
Look at me! I am Chandler! Can I
Yeah.
Whew, it's hot with all that stuff.
I ah, I better not do it, I do not know, splits.

Hi.
Hi.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry before.
I do not need a game room.
I mean, when I was a child, I only played these games because I could not have girls, and now I
Stop Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Really?
Yeah! Oh yes!
Ohh
Listen, we do not have to make it a bed and breakfast, we can think of something that concerns them together.
It's a good idea! we can
Totally!
We do not have to come with that now.
Oh good.
Yes, and I agree to be a breeze.
It's awesome. Good for you guys.
I am not very demanding in maintenance!
I'm not a child's play!
Who said you were?
You did it!
Oh, I'm flaky. I will say anything.

Ok, I know it's going to sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do it, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, I can not do anything more.
It does not seem stupid to me.
You know, it's like the first time I had to get ready for dinner after Carol left?
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
Next on Ross ... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the laundry is over.
It is a song.
The laundry song we sing.
Uh-oh, the laundry is finished, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross, what's the problem?
Nothing nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry is finished.
Why are you here?
Well, Sid and I are still trying and we had problems last time because apparently we ...
No no no ... I mean,
Oh! Someone is a little grumpy today because they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the size of a child.
What!?
It was fun! But I have an invasive vaginal exam to do!
I would love to stay, but I ... had a date ...
Leave, please! Let me know if you need a hand!
I think it just fell.

I do not want to be single, okay? I just want ... I just want - I just want to be married again!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel ?!
Yeah.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us on a ride and I will not let them do it!
And we are not a couple of suckers!
I hear you, Mugsy!
But look, all these rooms are okay?
Can you just pick one for me to watch - have a magical and perfect weekend with you.
Okay,
Nothing! It's finish! Shit! It's a regularly scheduled program!
Can we turn off the TV? Okay? Do we really want to spend all weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I disturbing the change of room?
Hey, do not blame me for stirring tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bellhop who had to drag the luggage to 10 different rooms?
I do not know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada with a half tank of gas!
Do not talk bad about the dead.
We are supposed to spend a romantic weekend together, what's your problem?
I just want to watch a little TV. What is the big problem? Definitely, relax mom.
What did you say?
I said, "God, relax Monnnnn."

You know, maybe it's better that we never have to do it again.
Yeah, it makes a little special tonight. You know, technically we still have
I'm going to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you later?
'Kay!
Can I ask you something?
Uh no
Felicity and I are watching
No.
I mean, the giant is five years younger than me, do you think I'll get there one day?
Yes.
Thanks dude.
Ok dude.
But how is he bigger than me?
I mean, I can not get bigger now, see?
And who knows what science will be developed in the future, if not Chandler, that if I die dead, a man of normal size without success?
Hey, Monica, you've been in the bathroom for half an hour.
I know!
Had the pieces of beef, huh?

Goodbye and good Lord, let's hope Brady.
Not so fast Wesley!
Remoray!
That's right Wesley! I just came by to say that you are not a real doctor! And this woman's brain is fine!
Oh! Thank God!
Hope! Hope!
Duck!
You do not die Hope, you will live long and healthy. With me.
Oh Drake.
Okay!
Here we go!
Okay!
Hi Joey!
It's Rachel!
Uh, I'm free tomorrow night.
Yes, of course, I can bring sandwiches.

OK, we had the cabbage salad, we had the rolls ...
We have the flesh of cows and turkeys that were once cute, ew ...
The men are here.
Mom, do you want to relax?
It was 10 blocks from here and the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that.
Mom, come on, stop worrying.
It's a safe street, it's a safe building, there's nothing
Hi.
Hi, hi can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Um, no she does not, but I can, I can send her a message.
Awesome. Uh, just tell her that her husband stopped.
What?
How did you do that?

Okay, someone.
OK, I'll go there. OK, last year of college ... on a pool table.
Whoooaa!
It's my sister.
OK ... my strangest place should be ... the women's room on the second floor of the New York City Public Library.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Pheebs, what about you?
Oh ... Milwaukee.
Um ... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, "It's a small world after all".
No way!
The carousel broke down.
So Carol and I went behind two of these Dutch mechanics kids ... then they repaired the car and we were told never to return to the magical realm.
Oh, Rachel.

Hey!
Hey!
Oh, the play is over?
Yeah. Where have you been?
Thank you for your patience, you are the next interlocutor.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must go crazy.
Nah. I found things to do.
Oh, ok, yes. I put your things in his room and his in your room.

Well, there is the past. And uh, you know, yesterday.
Yeah no, I tell you Rachel has such an eye for things like that.
Ross, you know if you decide to redecorate one day, and I think you should do it.
You should ask Rachel to help you.
Oh honey, he does not need my help.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of it, how did you call it? Cheap imitations and junk food from dinosaurs.
Really?!
Hey, you know what?
Since you have such a good idea of ​​what I need, uh, here's $ 60 billion, why do not you take Phoebe at your Colonial flea market and get something from me.
You know what? I do not think Phoebe really wants to come.
No! I want!
Oh, she really wants.
She wants.
Yeah!

Wow, you really have beautiful feet.
These old things.
Would you like to spend time in my Siadic region, it is killing me today.
You mean by-okay by siadic, you mean the part covered with a towel.
Yeah.
Of course, yes, no, I can do it, yes, because, uh, you know, the muscles of the Siadic region can be very beautiful and tight.
So, tell me Rick, how did you hurt the area?
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Oh.
Ow! You just bit me?
No!

Uh, that's it.
No.
Hey!
You!
J.
Crew member.
Yeah.
Why are you?
I mean, all week long, wherever I look, there is you.
You would not return my calls, you returned my letters ...
What?
One more chance, Ursula, please?
Okay.

Ok, and then it's coffee. This is where I play my music.
Good deal.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Hi!
Hi! Okay, let's go shopping !!
Uh, you know, before leaving ah, there's something I have to say.
Oh ok.
I had a bit of that ah, that crush on you.
But since you were with Ross, I - I did not do anything about it.
But now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you to go out someday.
That's what I'm doing now.
Wow! Umm ....
I dropped a cup.

Hello, little embryos.
Well, I'm Phoebe Buffay, hello!
I-i-I-I-hope to be your uterus for the next nine months.
You should know that we are doing this for Frank and Alice, you know you've been there already!
You know they want so much from you, so when you go, grab him.
Okay, and-and I promise to keep you warm until you're ready to take them home, so Oh!
And also, the next time you see me, I scream, do not worry, that's what's supposed to happen.
Ready?
Uh-huh. Good luck.

We are baack!
Hey!
What are you guys doing together?
Joey and Janice
Really.
Yeah yeah.
We went to a game of Mets, we had Chinese food and you know, I love this woman.
You have a competition buddy.
I just gave you a kiss, I have to go get the baby, then.
I'll see you later darling, you too Chandler.
You still can not stand it, do you?
I'm sorry man, I'm tired, I really did it.
Well, you know, I appreciate you trying.
But, listen, you know the good thing is we spent the whole day together and I survived. What is even more amazing is what she did.
It was the day of the bats at Shea Stadium.
You told him to play gay boxer !!
Well, I might have said supergay.
You totally screwed him up.
Joey, you're the teacher of this guy. I mean, how can you do that?
Because, Monica, the guy is so good, and I really, really want this part.
Well, if you really want it, then it's okay.

We then have to wait for data from recent MRI and MRI scans that challenge the information gathered during simple carbon dating years.
Look at this woman sitting by the pool sunbathing ... so hard and wrinkled, I'm so
I am not your brother.
What about my Drake kids ?! Huh? No!! No!! No! God!
Why not try to massage the chest to stimulate the flow.
I hope you are joking?!
It's so frustrating! Why does not she want my chest ?!
I do not know! Maybe she's crazy!

Hey Joey, I have some beer for you.
Uh, you do not want to say "for whom?"
Of course, listen, I'm going to order a pizza, do you want to share one?
Pizza, heh, it's not like I've never had this before ... ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is anything wrong?
Okay, okay, let's talk about it openly, okay?
You are hot.
I am adorable.
Clearly, there is an atmosphere between us.
But we are roommates and it is a big mistake for us to continue on this path.
Joey ...
Oh no it is not, no it is not. It's a first date. I am
Oh.
Ho-oh, he'll get some!
From the lamplight of his apartment.
You know, um, he closed the curtains so he could have a nice conversation with your little sister.
Well, I'm going to bed!

You were so funny with this server! You are a nut!
You know, fangs in bread sticks are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You are the funny!
Uh, look Katie, uh, listen, we have to talk.
Okay?
Uh, look, I love you.
I-I really like it, I love you a lot.
Okay?
But sometimes, when you give me a punch like that, it feels like someone is hitting me with a very small but very
Aww, as if I could hurt you. Do you make fun of my size? Do not make fun of me because of my size!

Oh, Joey! Sorry!
They made you the head of the department!
No, I'm going to teach one of his advanced classes! Why did not I head the department?
Oh! Hi Rachel, listen
Yeah.
I have a big date, do you know a good restaurant?
Uh, Paul's coffee. They have great food and it's really romantic.
Ooh, great! Thank you!
Yeah! Oh, and then you can take him to
You're sure to name a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell you
Ooh, I miss dating.
Gettin 'all dressed and go to a fancy restaurant.
I will not be able to do this for so long, and it's so much fun!
I do not want to say that staying at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen-pound baby is not fun.
Hey, you know what?
Huh?
Why do not I bring you?
What?! Joey, you do not want to go to an appointment with a pregnant woman.
Yes!
And we're going out, we're going to have a good time and we're not thinking about deliveries, caesareans and giant baby heads
Okay! I come with you! I go! I come with you.
I will be fun.
Okay?

Hi!
Hey!
Joey, I have to tell you that I thought
Oh, you know, the writing was good and the director is good, and ... and my co-star is good
My God, you must tell me what will happen tomorrow!
Ow, I'm just reviewing the script now! Do you want to read lines with me?
Me? Oh no, I'm not an actress.
Oh, okay, I can ask Monica.
Oh, live, this part is mine!
Well ... ok, so just at the top of the page, right here.
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
I can not believe you married him.
But what choice did I have? He kept my sister in a
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
It's finish! You
How can I?
Knowing that I will never hold you in my arms, that I will not touch your skin or that I will not feel your lips, knowing that I will never make love to you?
How can I accept that ...
I will never be able to kiss you again so that's all I can do to not kiss you now.
Kiss Me.
What?

Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you have the biggest half. What did you want?
The largest half.
I would like to propose a toast.
Toast here, ding ding.
I know it's not the kind of Thanksgiving you've all planned for, but to me it was really great, you know, I think, because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you were going to Vail, and if you were with your family, if you did not have syphilis and all the rest, we would not all be together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very grateful that all your Thanksgivings have been void.
This is so cute.
And hey, here's an ugly Christmas.
And a new year of shit.
Here here!

Now, wait!
Wait!
Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now you can tell her that I will be at this airport and I hope she will be there too!
Oh yes, I said Rachel's name, but it did not mean anything, okay?
She is just a friend and that's it!
That's all!
Now, just tell Emily that I love her and that I can not imagine spending my life with someone else.
Please, promise me that you will tell him that.
Okay, I'll tell him. Go face fuck!
Call me.
You spend half of your life in the bathroom, why do not you go out by the damn window!

What happened?!!
Well, I do not know !!
We fell asleep! That's all.
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. All right, I'd better go.
I think it would be better.
Yeah. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Okay. But not about it!
No! Never! Never! Goodbye.
Not touch! Not touch!

Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I have some bad news. I do not think I can move to Tulsa.
What?
It's a funny story, actually.
I fell asleep at the meeting this morning, so when I said I was moving to Tulsa, I did not really know what I was saying.
You fell asleep?
But only because I stayed up all night worried about this meeting, is not it funny?
Irony?
Not a fan, okay.
You see, here's the thing.
I went home and told Tulsa about my wife and she will not leave.
See, I love Tulsa!
Tulsa is paradise!
Tulsa, it's Italy. Do not force me to go!
Chandler, I ...
No no no!
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
Why should I call you Elaine?
Oh what a beautiful picture of your son, bloody!
It's a picture of your daughter, is not it, she is adorable.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.
I will call you from Tulsa.

Hi.
Hey.
How are you?
I'm not too bad Fortunately, blue is my color. How did you know I was here?
Because ... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card that you used.
That I did not expect.
I want you to know that I did not give you back.
Oh. Thank you.
No thanks! You gave me so much! I mean, without you, I would never have sung
In fact, you only have to sing "Memo-".
I can not believe you're here.
I mean, what will I do without you?
Who will be partying at the embassy with me?
Who will take me to
Uh ... Oh, Mindy, you're so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Familiar smell?
Oh no.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
No, I'm so sorry ...
Oh my.

Well, it's impossible for me to be vaccinated.
Maybe they can take the needle and inject it into my mouth, like a thiffirt rifle.
Doctor, can I see you for a minute, please? My brother has a slight phobia of needles.
Did you tell him about my Thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the doctoral student, would like to know if there is a way to deal with this orally.
No, in these circumstances, it must be an injection and now.
Tho?
Ohhh
That's good, sit down.
The doctor says it must be a needle.
You're just going to have to be brave, okay?
Can you do this for me?
Okay.
Okay. Oh man. You are doing so well. Do you want to shake my hand?
Yes!
Okay.
Okay, Ross, do not hold on tight.
Honey, really, do not squeeze so hard!
Oh, Ross!
Let go of my hand!

You will love me so much. I have Sting tickets !!
Oh my God! I really love you! How did you do?!
Well, let's just say
Oo, where are the seats?
Uh, the middle balcony.
You are a nasty old woman.
No! Wait no! Shut up, I mean do not cry! Let me get my checkbook!
Look honey, you do not have to do that, okay?
It's the strength you have inside that matters most to me.
You are loyal, honest and honest!
That's the kind of strength I want in the man I love!
It does not mean anything to me. Come on!

Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Hey.
: What are you doing?
Ummm. Oh! I am sorry. It's a little old but
: No! You are in the process of fouling the chute that I spent half an hour to unclog!
I am sorry. I did not come here a lot.
: Oh yes, of course not!
No.
: Because you are a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza, dad, buy me a candy factory, Daddy, do the casting of
I never said that.
: You think you could do some damage and the big man in combination will come here and clean it up, huh?
Well, why not think of someone else to change?
OK I am sorry.
Hi!
What is this?
Oh yes it's the phone number of this girl.
Yeah, yeah, that's it, just a phone number that a very sexy girl gave me.
It does not matter, I mean, it's his home phone number, but ... Whoa!
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost that baby!
Yes, the beautiful Amanda gives me her number and I will drop it.
Thank you.

I do not know how one of them opened ?!
You have them all open?
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler will never trust me again!
Oh hey! You have the gift of my parents!
Yeah. What is it?
Well, I do not know. I think it does something to salami.
Hey! How did it go?
Yeah. What did Tag say?
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
I'm doing Rachel. I do it and I am so happy for you.
Oh wow, you did not even try to pick up my bra!
So, are you ever going to tell anyone?
No, I'll do it I'm not going for it tonight.
Hey Rach, listen, no matter what this guy says, I want you to know that you will not be alone in this situation.
I'm not?
Listen, I ... It's a scary world, especially if you're a single mother.
You know, I always felt like you and I have this special link.
You know?
So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
Thank you.
If I can not have it you can not have it!

I can not believe it, you know, it's so typical.
Now, Monica, I know you're angry, but do not forget.
There will be a wedding, you will throw the bouquet, and
Paris?
We are going for a moonlit walk on the rue de la.
Continue to speak.
Then we will sprinkle pink pedals on the bed and make love. Not only because it's romantic, but because I can!
I love you!

Yes!
I win again!
Ha-ha!
It's like $ 500 you owe me!
Whoo-hoo-ho!
$ 500 is a lot of electricity!
Whoo-ho-ho!
I have to buy food.
Ok, give me a chance to get my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $ 1,000.
Are you serious?
Oh yes!
Ok, get ready to have me!
Okay.
Ok, here we go. Ready?
No! No! No! Nobody can beat me.
See? Now, that's the reason why only the fake men are supposed to kick.

Who is it?!
Do not worry, I'm brave!
I am courageous!
I am brave!
No no no no!!
Can you tell me who is there please?
Hi!
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
It's candy time! My roommate says they taste like small drops of paradise.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Small drops of sky.
4:00 AM IN THE MORNING.
So, can I have candy?
I'm sorry, but some of us have to
Uh, listen, I'm sorry, but I'm going out early in the morning.
Okay, I'll go later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.
Mm! Looks like I would have remembered you!
Mm! Night Gar '!

Aaron! You must let me go. The guy is hammered!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and aware that we're still shooting.
You would not have a very big fork?
So, uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Well, have we finished the scene?
Yeah! You were wonderful.
As you were.
So I have your car, it's just outside.
Why? Are we made for the day?
That's what you told me.
Oh thank you. You are welcome.
No no no! We must go! Come on! Here we go.
Is it my ass?

What about these? These are alike?
Absolutely!
Not like the others!
Oh, so no.
Hey!
Hi!
You're ready?
Yeah.
You are very beautiful. I am the luckiest man in the world.
Ohh, you're about to have a little luck.
Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings
They have a beautiful look! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really tastes good!
Thank you for choosing the man with the earrings.
Hm-mmm.

I know there is no hole there, I really liked this picture.
Oh my God! Look at this!
Okay, but here
I do not care! The threads are loose in your head!
I just thought that if I could follow the thread, I could find what he did.
And do you have ?!
No, he disappears behind this plinth. For a minute, I thought it was going down.
But that was not the case. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.
Hello Darling.
Hello, Madame Chatracus.

Ok, is everyone clear? We will pick it up and move it. Now, all we need is teamwork, okay? We will
Ross, I really do not think
Elevator!! And slip!
Ok, here we go.
All right, lift up! And slip !!

Ok Carl, we are next. Now remember, what is not going to be?
Another
It is true! And what are you not going to do?
Well, I'm not going to talk because
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never go away completely, but
Oh my God, I-I understand.
I-I'm so sorry, I'll go.
Goodbye Monica, I wish you a happy life with him.
Chandler, you call me when it happens in the thief.

Yeah?
I found my identical twin!
Ohh, you are
No!
But she's coming up here!
It was Joey!
I wonder where she is. It's so weird.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Do you want to stop that!
Do you want to know the first thing she said when she came back from lunch with Richard?
She did not feel anything for him.
She loves You!
Really?
Yes! Now she feels very bad! She really wants to wear makeup! You must find her.
Okay.
Well. I really should start wearing hats!

I mean, why should I let them meet him?
I mean, I bring a guy home, and after five minutes, everything is on him.
I mean, these are coyotes that kill the weak limbs of the flock.
Listening
As someone who has seen more than his fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: it's not such a bad thing.
I mean, they are your friends, they watch over you.
I know. I just wish that once, I bring back a guy at home that they really liked.
Well, you realize that the chances of that happening are a bit thinner if they never meet the guy ..

No no no no. Hey!
In any case, I should go there. Okay goodbye.
Hey darling.
Hello Darling. So what was there with all these whispers?
I can not tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people are not supposed to have secrets between themselves. We have too much love and respect for each other.
Awww. But still no.
No, I'm serious, we should think
Really? Ok, so why do not you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at
Oh no-no, I can not do that.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Okay.
Okay.
So, Ross and I are going
Oh my God. He vomited?
No, he visited a small town in the south to vomit. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's former massage place is fired.
That's all?! I gave up my
It is true! You lose the sucker !! Please, marry me again.

Ahhh! Ooh good!
My God!
Oh hey! How was your hearing?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just training to get rid of you because I'm going to be a big movie star!
Oh! You got it?!
Well no, not yet. But the audition went really well.
What was it for?
Oh, it's this big budget movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America at the turn of the century.
It's really chic!
Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese.
The next next?
Yes, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, okay?
But then this guy is right after him.
Hi!
They loved me!
Oh my God!
I hope you are joking? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, all right, let me remind you.
What's the problem?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Wow!
I know! My grandmother will see that!
Grandmother will have to queue.

Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
What? Of course I did it! You sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
Oh uh, I could not remember everyone's name, so I-I'm a little bit nicknames.
Smelly von Brownshirt was on the other side of you.
Oh yes. So, uh, did you have a nickname for me?
Umm, no. No.
Yes you can! what was that?
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Ohh that's so nice!
Listen, I have to tell you I'm having a good time!
You know how, before you said, it can be weird, everything about the student teacher, and to be honest, I thought it would be too, but it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Burt!

Okay, so we still have some good releases, a lot of things to work on.
Ok, shoot.
Ok, uh, oh, zoo advertising.
I did not have it?
No, they said you were not credible as a human being. So, you can work on that.
Okay what else?
Uh, people on the Broadway scene said, "You were pretty, but stupid."
Oh.
Oh no, wait, I'm sorry, it's pretty silly.
Hey.
How is the maniac?
Oh, well, it's delicious. We made a little kiss.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not in this stuff anymore. He left for me.
Pheebs, this guy is obsessed with your sister, because God knows how long, okay, you're not giving up something like that.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Are you speaking about a guy who has night vision goggles?
What, he still does not follow her. Do you think he's still following her?
Pheebs, wake up and feel the restraining order.
What do you say I should do?
I think if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thank you Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he's going.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.

Hey guys check it out! My mother sent me the paper!
Ooh, see that!
Ahhh.
Ah!
She's not crazy, is she?
No.
So how are you?

Here it is!
Here is our star!
So, what did you think?
Almost as good as playing with the two naked girls on the swing.
I - I was not in that.
Wow, I have the wit of an old Indian woman living in mine.
So you know?
The postman was down, so I brought your mail.
Oh good. Thank you.
Now what is Fabutec?
Ok, ok do not judge me too much.
Okay?
Uh, but I saw this info-market, and uh, I swear I never bought anything on TV before, except for this broom.
But there was that kind of thing about waxing legs, it was so amazing ...
Waxine !!
Yes! Have you seen him?
Oh, it's amazing! I want so much to be a Waxine girl.
I know!!
God. Do you think it really does not hurt? Because how can they do that?
Hi! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rainforest!
They have the best things in there.

Comin 'through. Move moves.
Oh, excuse me. I used this machine a bit.
Yeah, well now you're a little not.
But I saved him. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, it's your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I do not see any foam.
What?
No foam, no backup. Okay?
What is going on?
Hi, nothing. This horrible woman has just taken my machine.
Your basket was on the top?
Yes, but there was no foam.
So?
Well, you know, no foam, no backup.
No foam? Excuse me, wait a second. This is my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, his things were not in there.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Because it's good money! But that does not change the fact that it is a perverse corporate machine that sucks blood!
Well, I think it's a good place to work!
Ok, they listen?

Varrrrrroom!
Hey!
Look at this lady!
Varrrrrrrrrrom!
Hey, look good!
Varrrrrrrrroom.
Okay, I'll leave.
My bed is so boring.

Ross, do you realize it's the first time in my life that I'm doing something that really matters to me.
It's the first time in my life that I'm doing something for which I'm really good.
I want to say.
if you do not understand that ...
No, hey, I have it, ok, I have this big time.
And I'm happy for you, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!
Ok, I do not know what to do.
Well me neither!
Hey!
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss something?
Joey stuffing 15
15? Your best staff! (Ross takes a
Where have you been?
Oh, an appointment. Yes, I met this girl on the train to a museum in the north of the state.
Oh yes! How did you meet her?
Oh, what museum?
No, answer his.
Okay, there was only him and her at the back of the train. I sat by the door. She had to go by if she wanted to change cars.
She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were tainting this woman?
No, I'm going down because she lives in Poughkeepsie.
She looks really cool, but she's really great, but she lives at half-past two.
How can she be great if she comes from Poughkeepsie? This joke would have killed Albany.
Completed! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?

No, there is no way! It can
Why your family
He can not play at our wedding!
I mean everyone will leave!
I mean come on, it's just noise!
It's not even a song!
If you listen very carefully, I think his

Oh, I want to watch too! . Yuck!
So do you think these images -Are they trying to tell a story?
Oh yes, of course.
I mean, as in the case of this young woman, she lost her clothes, so she goes naked on the horse, she shouts, "Where are they, where are they?
Well, she will not find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh yes. Aw, do you remember how long you went to the barn, lifted your shirt and bent?
Yeah.
You see, now I'm going out with this girl.
She's cute, she's out in the open, you know, and she knows how to make fire.
I mean, it must be useful
Ok, I have a question. If you had to choose one of us to go out with you, who would it be?
I do not know.
Neither do I.
Rachel
What?!
I do not know. Neither do I.

Listen, I meant I'm sorry for losing you
Listen, I have a secret for you. I let him win.
Is it a secret or a lie?
No, I let him win-Ross!
Yeah?
Do you want to tell him that I let you win, please?
Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler
I am strong! I will show you!
Chandler please!
Oh what's the problem? Are you scared?
Let's go big bunny!
Okay. 1 2 3-Go! I'm going to kill me!

Hey Ross, is Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten
Ohhh I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Wow! Do you realize that we are throwing this ball without dropping it for an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I understood it about half an hour ago, but I did not want to say anything because I did not want to send it.
Wow! We are very good at that! Hey! We totally forgot the lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think it's the first time I miss a meal! Yes, my pants are a little loose!
Hey guys
Hey!

Who is it?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey!
Oh my God. You make porn movies.
No I'm not.
You make one now!
And-
Yes, can I help you with something?
Look, I'm talking right now! You want to say it.
You know, twin things are always a real big seller.
What?!
Yeah, I can convince them to give you 30 bucks.
No!!
No way!
No!
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!
And shame on you all!
You're disgusting!
Especially you with that!

Hey!
Hi Pheebs!
You move?
No, they are not all my suitcases. This one is Paolo's.
Uh, Rachel, can we talk for a second?
Well, of course ... just a second, because Paolo is about to arrive.
Oh! Ok, uh, ok, uh,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs ...
Ok, uh, we have not known each other for so long and, uh, there are three things you should know about me.
First, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and third, I make the world's best oatmeal and raisin cookies.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have not I tasted them before ?!
Oh, I do not do them much because I do not think it's right for other cookies
Okay, okay, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.
I suppose not.
Paolo made a pass to me.

I am really sorry. Please, stop panicking.
I do not panic.
Why should I panic?
A woman named Heldi called and said we were going to get married, but that happens every day.
Honey, we were in this beautiful place, and I-I-I just entered our names for fun!
I mean, what's wrong with that?
Right here!
Chandler, please, do not think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
Phoebe and Rachel!
So the people who knew our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi and apparently a group called Starlight Magic 7 that are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please do not take this for nothing, because it is not.
Okay.
Really?
Yes, if it really does not mean anything, because you know I'm not ready
I know! I know.
Okay.
I'll tell Joey that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Hey, did she buy it?
Totally.
Did Heldi show you the place?
Yeah it's beautiful
I can not believe you're going to ask Monica to marry you!
I know.

No Phoebe!
You can not get the phone that way; it is not fair!
Ok look, I have an idea.
Why not see, what kind of number he has on his abbreviated number, and from there, we can say who has more in common with him
And then, whoever gets the phone.
Or, we can decide which name is closest to the word phone.
I do not think so.
All right, but I'll bet you sing another song if we fight for a ratchet.
Okay, the first name on the abbreviated number is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mother to suicide.
Okay, you can not use that to get the cute guy and the latest blueberry muffin.
Do I use it today? I am sorry.
Yes OK.
Well, now, see that it does not tell us anything.
Joe
Carlos
To fart.
Ooh!
Peter Luger!
It's a steak house!
Ok, a meat eater. Well, it's one for you.
Oh, I win! He has
So you do not know it's
His new girlfriend!

I can not believe. Do you think your parents could help pay for it?
I do not know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
She keeps the rest for her divorce.
And all the extra money my father saved for his annual trips
Well, what happened at dinner?
My parents spent money on our wedding!
My God! What did you order ?!
Wait, but there is no money! Well it's terrible! You will have to get married like a guy. center!
Honey, it's okay.
No! No it is not! It will not go well! That sucks! No swing group! No lily!
No, you know what?
It's gonna be okay.
I mean you do not need this rustic Italian feast.
You know?
And-and you do not need, you do not need this custom-made dress, empire-size, duchess, satin; you can wear off the rack.

Dr. Geller, there is a seat here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having lunch at this table in the middle.
I'm having lunch here, with my good friend Joey, if he stays with me.
I'm going to sit down with you Dr. Geller.
You know, we work in a natural history museum, and yet the way we have lunch has something wrong.
Now, I look around this cafeteria and you see what I see, I see I see the division.
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I wonder, "My God why ?!"
Now, I say we put on these coats that separate us and we get to know the people below.
I am Ross!
I am divorced and have a child!
I'm Joey! I am an actor! I do not know dinosaur squat!
I'm Ted and I just moved here a month ago and New York really scares me.
Okay, that's it!
Yeah, you hang out here Teddy!
I am Andrew and I did not pay this pear.
Ok, good, good for you.
I am Rhonda and it is not real!
Wow, Rhonda.
I am Scott
Yeah, all right, Scott!
And I have to turn on and off the light 17 times before leaving a room where my family will die.

So thank you for the warm welcome.
It's good to have you in my team and I come to play.
I hope you too.
Now, let's go and go get them!
Huh?
And remember, there is no "I" on the team.
Yes, but there are two in martini, so everyone
You! Chuckles! What is your name?
Oh, it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry, I was just ah ...
No-no, I heard what you said, funny.
I like to laugh.
This team requires a lot of work, but also fun.
Happy to have you aboard Bing!

Yeah. You will not be able to take it.
So uh, now this little Chandler turned out to be a girl, how are they going to name her?
They will call him Chandler.
It's a kind of male name, do not you think?
Work on you.

Oh, that's so nice.
No, no, all right, you hang up.
Ok, ok, one, two, three.
Well, you did not hang up either.
She did not hang up either ...
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, yourself,
Ross, hello, it's Rachel.
I just call to say that uh, everything is fine and I'm really happy for you and your
Rachel, I received a message from you.
Oh my God.
Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give the phone, give the phone, give me the
.
.
Are you on me?
Ohhhhhhhh God.
Wha ... are you uh you are on me?
Oh oh.
When, when did you ... under me?
Basically, lately, I had, in a way, feelings for you.
OK, I need to go to bed.

Hey! I'm inside, they'll let me audition!
Really? It's awesome!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting women saw me in a play, so I avoided her
(noticing a child who picked up a copy of
Oh yes, yes! He made tons of advertisements. I saw it in Sugar Smacks,
Yeah, well, he's not going to get it.
Ben is a lot cuter than this kid.
I mean watch it, look at you,
It's awesome. Look, would not it be great if I had to play Ben's father?
Joey, you do not look like Ben.
I look like him more than you!
You know, I do not really know you enough so you can do that.

It was really one of your best jobs.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can not believe I only have two hours before calling sick to work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, you're not going to believe it, but if you have seven minutes
Really?!
Do you want?
Okay! You get the vacuum and I'm going to get the furniture polish!

Oh ok. But what do you know? Pay attention. Because a guy who helped me before had to leave because he had hurt his back.
Boyfriend?
No.
I am Joey.
Kristen
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Kristen
I got it! So
So, do you live here?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Just down.
Hey listen; let me give you a small tip.
Do not take a nap on this porch or you can wake up without shoes.
I'll remember it.
Okay. Yeah. Listen, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
But why not tomorrow?
Great! Okay, ok, where are you going?
You look strong, why do not I take that and you catch one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah. Yes, I will take this one.

Hey.
Listen, uh ...
I am sorry.
: Yeah, uh ... you know, you should forget what I said under the bridge, I was talking
That's right, I do not ... But I was, I was drunk!
Ok, yeah, so that will not work.
If so, would you stop going out with her?
Uh, so yes, it's because of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either she or me.
You know ... you'll be really, really hard to overcome.

By the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see much of me.
Oh, good morning liar.
Look, I'm so sorry for giving up on the bike.
I could have been killed I hope you know!
I know. I know. But can we please try again? Huh? I mean, you were
I would like, but the bike has been stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe
What?! What is going on?!
Okay, you know what?
If you're not going to learn to ride a bike, I'm sorry, I'll have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
Because! Because, it is, it's as if you had this guitar and you never played it. Okay, this guitar
Okay. If you care enough to make you pay that shit, all right.
Awesome! Awesome! You make the bike very happy.
Ok Ross! Please do not die!

How could you keep all this from me?
I was going to tell you, but
But what?! You thought you'd get what you wanted and let go of it like you dropped Rachel!
Hey! I did not drop Rachel! We are not together yet either. Can I just Why not let the machine get it?
Hi Ross. It's Joey. There is a whore here and we thought you might know something about it.
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I-must-I, I must lie down.

Everything about your application looks really good-Ohh!
Just one last question, are you and your friends going to be here all the time like to party and hang out?
Oh do not worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa !! Listen, do not just give up. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
You can call roommate search! Hi! I will live here.
Oh, do not listen to him, he's just a guy who really wants the apartment, but I do not think he'll get it.
Why did you lower the shower curtain?
This thing was a danger! I am very conscious of security.

Hi.
Hey man, how was the audition?
Estelle said I did not understand.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for that!
Yes, I thought so too, but she said that the cast people had problems with me.
No!
As far as I know, she tries to find me but can not because I'm moving around constantly.
No, from now on, I stay in one place.
Right here.
Well, it's getting late.
Yes, we will go there.
In fact, do not you mind staying here for a while?
You know, we have to get up early and fly to New York.
Yes, it's a very big plane.
That's great.
But we will stay here with you.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate that, you know, but you do not have to rub my buttocks.

Hi, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
They are not a couple!
Oh, ok, I understand the game now.
Ok, listen, let me ask you a question. When they did it on stage, was it really hot?
Oh yes!
Okay, so all is well.
The rule is that when two actors do it outside the stage, all the sexual tensions between them have disappeared.
Okay?
So, as long as it's hot on stage, you have nothing to fear.
It's when the heat goes away, it's when you have problems.
Really?
Look, you've been to every room I've played, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
No.
Noooo !!

Ursula! Expect! Uh, it's me! Phoebe!
Oh, I thought there was a mirror. Okay goodbye.
Wait a second! So what's up with you?
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm going to get married next week.
And your breasts! Hmm !!!
Okay.
Umm look, you come a little hard.
But I will give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems that the universe really wants to be together.
So why do not we do it again, okay?
And you can just tell me about yourself.
Okay.
Okay.
I write erotic novels, for children.
What?!
They are wildly unpopular.
Oh my God!
Oh too, you might be interested to know that I have a doctorate
Wow! You do?
Yes, a pretty huge
Okay.

So, how is she?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How are you, Mom?
Me? I'm fine, good. I'm glad you're here. ... What is your hair?
What?
What is different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She is amazing, our mother is ...
Ok, relax, relax.
We'll be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have a boyfriend and your career to cover.
Oh my God!
The little candies at the bottom of her purse.
Oh!
... yes, they were disgusting.
Oh, do you know what I liked?
His Sweet 'n' Los.
How she always stole them at restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from home.
May be.
You can not!
Why? Seriously, I did not understand a word you said.
In the hall.

Now, you see, most people, when their pets disappear, they want to see them as dormant.
But sometimes you get your person wanting them in a pose.
For example, running after their tail or jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I want to get my keys.
It's a good one!
Hi Joe.
Dad, Ronni is here.
Huh?

So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if you like what you want, we can make you a market.
Nothing at all.
But these are the three that Monica has pre-approved.
Thank you very much for hanging me up, Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as a guest.
I'm Monica's bridesmaid. Okay? Do not try to pin me!

Oh here, I think it's us. Yeah.
Limited sits my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
I am Monica Gellar. Who do you know about the bride and groom?
Used to work with her. Used to! I am a parent and I have not been invited! A
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.
So, what about you, huh? How do you know the happy couple?
OK you are well.

Monica, why did you bring me here from all sides ?!
You will see.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Oh my God.
Okay? But, but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and you know less bricks, and-and-and-flowers and candles
And the musicians, listen, they can go here, okay? And the chairs can face that way, and you go.
But, but if you do not like it, we'll do it elsewhere, at another time.
Really, it's good, whatever you want.
It's perfect.
And, I do not know, if it starts to rain
Well, we are going to get wet.
Ohh, and I do not even have a date.

To come up.
I have a bone to choose with you.
Uh-oh.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yes? Did he shoot the old
It is true! It is true!
Oh that.
Yeah that! You know I hate jokes! They are mean and stupid and I do not want my son to learn them!
You know what? It does not matter! Because it's not true!
Okay.
And if it was true, how
Mrs. Monroe Oh, that's it.

Mark is a genius!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Look, you do not see what's going on here.
Instead of flirting with him right away, he becomes his confidant.
Now he's going to be the guy she's going to complain about you too.
What am I going to do?
Well, why do not you send him a bug, op, no, you've done it already.
Well, look, you'll have to go yourself now, okay, make some surprise visits.
I do not know you guys.
Very well, do not do anything, stay seated talking to us and during this time, she talks to him about you.
And he's Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking, "Maybe he's the guy for me, because he understands me.
And before you know it, she's with him.
And you will all be, 'Ohh, man!'
And he will be everything, 'Yes!'
And we will be like, 'Wh-whoa, man.'
And soon, you'll be like 'Hhiii' and, and, and 'I can not go, Rachel and Mark could be here.
And we'll be like, 'Damn it, it's been four years !!'
He's taking a picture, is not he?

That's what I did for the party so far, as far as alcohol is concerned. Get a lot of alcohol.
Awesome. Awesome.
Okay, uh, regarding the guest list, I have you, me and Chandler, and I'm going to invite Gunther because, well, we talked about it pretty hard.
I will be there.
All right, oh!
Look, I know it's your party, but I'd love to see how many museum geeks are there.
Yeah. Say what, do not invite anthropologists, only types of dinosaurs!
Okay! We will need a package of six
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Hey, you know what, if you're going to do that, if you're going to call him Joey, you should call him Chandler.
Oh, come on!
Chandler is funny, sophisticated and very kind once you know him.
Well, Joey is adorable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, well, maybe he'll be a little late, but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you some cold soda, if you want, you need him, it's that you're really hot.
What are you saying? What are you saying?
I like the idea of ​​giving him the name of someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are big names.
But all right, maybe I'll only call it The Hulk.
I knew I should not have talked about it! That's what I wanted to call my child!

What Rachel did in her life ... We met her parents at the club, they did not play very well.
I'm not going to tell you what they spent for this wedding ... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
At least she was lucky to leave a man at the altar ...
What is it supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.
No it is not.
Do not listen to your mother.
You are independent and you have always been!
Even when you were a kid ... and you were chubby and you had no friends, you were fine!
And you would read alone in your room and your riddles ...

PBS telethon.
Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
I
$ 200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after which
Oh, I'm still mad at them, but now that they bring happiness to many children whose mothers have not killed themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
What kind of problem?
Well, actually, they had a problem with the bag!
Oh my God!
Nooooo!
You know what? It was a stupid game anyway!
You know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I do not want to give up the bag.
I do not have to give up the bag!
Am I Rach?
Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey, wait, Joey, I'm sorry, I mean as great as I think you're with her
Oh hey!
I do not know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can not believe I hear that!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I'm not saying you should not have a bag, but just-there are others who are a little less humble, controversial.
Yes, they are called portfolios.

I think you will find this room more to your liking.
Okay! Great.
They say he has only half a tank left.
A half tank? We still have a lot of high speed chases to do!
We change rooms again.
What? Why?
It is a garden view room and we paid for a ocean view room.
Our last room with ocean view was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me, can I speak to you for a second?
Uh-huh.
Chandler!
I hope you are joking?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey !!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey !!
Oh. Oh, did I wake you up?

Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was about to leave. I-I-I-I-I-I did not think you were coming.
Oh, I would not miss it.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Oh, you are such a gentleman. Come on! We go home!

Hey!
Eh eh.
So are the guys okay?
Yes, we talked and Monica made me understand that I had reacted too much and that some things in life are more important.
Do you have a minute?
Well yes, of course, what's up?
The guys asked me to go out twice today while I was at lunch.
Oh really?!
Yeah. Did you tell someone I was gay?
Oh, did not you want people to know?
But I'm not gay. And most importantly, I would not want you to think I was gay.
Why this?
I do not think I should say.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I do not want you to feel that you can not tell me things.
Okay.
'Kay.
well
Yeah.
I would love to ask your friend Phoebe.
Yes, she is gay.

Here you are.
Awesome! Okay, I'll call you later.
Awesome!
Hey hey! Who was it?
It would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Get out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things did not work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
No, it's okay with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, just after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Yeah yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a pizza myself!
Expect! You go out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you so pissed off?
Well, I'm upset for you. I mean, having sex with an endless row of beautiful women must be very unsatisfactory for you.
What is the big problem? It's not like we're exclusive.
Listen, Joey, Kathy clearly does not respond to your emotional needs.
But Casey, I mean, I've only seen the back of her head, but I feel like she's - she's smart, funny, and she understands you.
Do you have all this from behind his head?
Good listen, I think it's time for you to calm down. You know? Make a choice, choose a path.
Who is Elaine?

Can not you see me ?!
So, are you going to talk to him?
I do not know Rachel.
Oh, come on! I will give you ten free
A! No, ten! You said ten! You can not take that back!

Hey!
Hi!
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your TV?
We need a porn break.
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
So why not turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who have disabled free porn.
Ooh, well, you hear! Okay.
Hey!
Hi!
Well, what was it?
Oh that, well I'm glad you asked.
Now, do not you hate when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
Ahh!
Now, I know what you think
Pregnant woman kills four?
Phoebe, they did not charge you for those knives, did they?
No!
Are you sure?
No!
Honey, you will not earn enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
No, no, I know, but I just need to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
What is the second part of your plan?

Yes, it's true.
Why?
I'm tired of attacking two women, I did not work.
What?!
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, it's my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me have this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife ?!
Oh no!
No no!
No I'm tired!
But I could not.
That's why I'm here.
Maybe we could attack them together?
It's a no.

What? No! No, I do not stop. I am Red Ross!
Dude, if you go back, you'll be Dead Ross!
I do not care! I do not go! I insist to finish this game!
Okay, okay, if you insist on that, let me at least help you.
No, my God no! This is not a place for a woman. These guys are going to catch anything.
No, that's not what I say. I may know some things that could help you inflict pain.
I like this.
Yeah? Listen well, Devon has a weak ankle.
Huh?
A quick kick and he will go back.
Okay, bad ankle, understood!
And this big guy with the beard, he has a hip.
Yeah.
And uh, and David there, I heard he was not wearing a cup.
Yeah? I can use that, hip tip, no cup, all right! Okay!
And uh, Liam, Liam's knee hurts. You hit him on the right and he goes down like a lamp.
But, but, Liam is in my team.
I do not care! You just took it!
I will go get him! Okay, I'm coming home!
The Red Ross! Okay.

Oh! Oh, by the way?
Uh-hmm.
James Brolin?
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, Ed Begley Jr and him, and then I remembered he was gay.
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?!

Hello?
Hello, is Ross here?
Uh no, he is not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce attorney, just told him that, since I did not hear him, I guess he decided to try the marriage.
Ross remarried-Nooooooo !!!!!!!!!

Oh oh! Okay, she kicks!
Oh! She is growing in you.
Whoa !!
Oh!
Wow it was a big one.
I think it's the youngest girl to reject me.
Oh hello guys!
Of course, I can spend time until I have to meet you. What are you not going to go there?
I have a job interview for which I have to prepare.
I thought you already had a job.
And people say you are not careful.
No, it's a much better job.
It is the vice president of a company that performs data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that ?!
That's what I'm doing now.
Hey Joey, come and taste that.
What is it?
Do you remember that guy who gave me a bad review? Well, I'm avenging myself!
You cooked it?
No.
He teaches a course on culinary criticism at the New School, so before going to the movies, I want to go there and have him try my bouillabaisse again.
Oh, I can not wait to read one of the Post tomorrow!
"The restaurant critic admits: I was wrong about Monica."
The first page? You really live in your own little world, do not you?

So, did you find someone to marry you?
No, but the Horny Minister for Monica called to find out if we were still together.
We will never find anyone.
So let me do it!
Joe
No no no!
Listen, I thought about it.
I am an actor no?
So I will not get nervous talking in front of people.
Joey look it's really nice
No no no no no!
I will not spit and I will not look at Monica's breasts!
You know?
Everybody knows that I am an ass man!
It is true.
Yes, and most importantly, it will not be a stranger like this one who barely knows you
It'll be me!
And I swear I'll do a very good job.
Besides, I love you guys, and that would really mean a lot to me.
You know, we did not find anyone else.
It may be a little cool.
So can I do it?
Ah-ha! Too arrogant!

I still can not believe they took my key. You trust me with yours.
Yes of course! And I'll give it back to you as soon as they're done in the main square.
What is that?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
You said there was a gas leak here.
Why do not you use your key?
Because when I find it on this thing, the whole place could have exploded.
If this happens in another building that I manage, people will start asking questions.
Come on!
Hurry up.
Oh! We could have done it.

Fortunately, the guy she's settled for does not understand what you're talking about.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Uh, and maybe I'm wrong!
But you know I'm going out with him again, I'll find out more.
You think this guy is for someone else and you always go out with him?
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl must eat.

(walking with this
God Ross, what is it?
Oh, but it made her so happy.
The little girl misses her cat.
A mad woman thinks her mother is in a cat.
Okay, you know what, I have to go to dinner with my son, can I be sure that when you see Phoebe, you'll tell him?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I
He's right, is not he?
You know what, I think maybe it's one of the times he's wrong.
You think?
Oh-no, he's right.

Seven hundred dollars!
Well, you did it! Do we have fruit?
Damn, two weeks, huh? You know what, though? I really feel like I have learned something.
Really? So, are you going to stay with this 'all for her' thing?
What are you crazy? When a blind man regains his sight, does he walk around like that?

Oh.
You know that these are a delight in India.
Me too.
Although this city is my home, then.
So that's stupid what I said, do not tell him that I said that.
Umm, you invent something.
Good thanks.
It's me.
Right here.
Your eyes are very beautiful.
Thank you so much! Oh! Thank you!
He would like to kiss you.
Ok, you know what, you do not have to do it now.
No no no no!!
Not him, not you!
Well, the moment is over.
Oh.
Oy!

Hey! Wait a minute, wait a second. Do you think these pearls are beautiful?
I would really prefer a mountain bike.
As Janice's birthday approaches, I want to offer her something special. Come here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
Do you, ah, want to offer him something special, flowers, sweets, chewing gum, girls love chewing gum.
It's a good idea, 'Dear Janice, celebrate her Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to do something serious to him.
Oh, you want something serious.
You know what you should do, you should give him one of those uh, barytic enemas.
These are very serious.
Okay. Listen, I'm going here, and you never buy me anything.
No, no, you can not, you can not, okay, you can not, you can not buy her pearls, you can not, you can not, you can not.
Why not?!
Oh my God. Uh, all right, here's the thing, that's the thing, okay, the thing is ...
What is the thing?
Okay. I went to the Mattress King showroom and saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?
They were in his office.
Well, she would not do that, she's with, she's with me.
Okay!!

I tell you it's like watching Bambi learn to walk.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are going to be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Just there! Can we get some of that here please? Here we are.
Hey! Are they crab cakes? Did not I tell you to come straight to me when other crab cakes were ready?
How are you?
You are
I really wish you would not do it.
Now, all you have to do is spend a little more, okay?
Then we can put you to bed, okay?
Smile and do not talk
Speech! Speech! Let's listen to the birthday girl! Huh?
Pheebs !!
You do not see? Everyone is watching me! The plan works! I have not even had to remove my top yet!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
Hey Chandler, you can not keep your hands for a second!
Oh-ho, I think that's good.
Well, you have to do it because maybe it's stupid.
Well, it's just while Monica and I were dancing with them that it was the first time I knew you were the woman I wanted to dance with all my dances.
Oh shit!

Okay.
The super could not understand what he was doing.
An electrician at $ 200 an hour could not understand what he was doing.
I had seven pretty serious shocks.
I give up officially.
Thank God.
I guess Joey was right, it does not matter.
See? I do it. I do it totally. I lost it.

Are there no conscious men in the city for both of you?
He has nobody.
Yes, we feel a little responsible.
I can not believe you said woowoo. I do not even say Woowoo.
Oh, she's going up! She is coming up!
When we come back, we will talk about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
You may want to put the children to bed for this one.
You know, we do not have to watch that.
No question, forget about it.
Come on, it's your mother!
Exactly.
Chandler, I must tell you that I love your mother's books!
I like his books!
I can not fly without one!
I mean, it's so cool!
Yeah, well, you would not think it was cool if you're eleven and all your friends go around page 79 of "Mistress Bitch".
Come on, Chandler, I love your mother. I think she is an explosion.
Thank you.
And a good hot cider for Monica.
AWW thank you. Uh Rach?
Yeah?
Why does my cinnamon stick have an eraser?
Oh! That is why. I am sorry!

Oh. Oh! Mrs? Excuse me madam?
Yes?
You can not put your cigarette on a tree!
Yes I can, it worked very well.
No, but you should not! Never do that again.
I do not want! Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze Punk!
What?!
Yeah it's true you're so broken. Book 'em.
Who are you talking about too?
Save the red! Unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
I am
You apologize to the tree or call for a backup. Backup! Backup !!
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
OK, cancel the backup! Cancel the backup!

Hush! Get me out of here.
Oh.
Ross!
What?
Come here, look at this!
What? Is it the comet?
No! No no. Look, there is a bug stuck in the tar here.
Joey, come on I can not believe-I'll take you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of the most spectacular phenomena in nature, and all you're concerned about are bugs stuck in the tar and -and a woman!
You know, there is
Show me where?
Right here.
Joey, where's the pipe that held the door open?
I do not know! Yes I do.
Joey!
What?! Very good-Hey! Do not look at me! You are the one who wanted to go up and look for some stupid
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!

Wow! This place is amazing! Sting's feather he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passage!
Hi!
Hi!
I am Trudie
Uh-huh.
You must be Ben's mom.
Why would I be here?
Sit.
Yeah.
Oh Rachel it's great. It's awesome.

Hi .. how was the game?
Well..
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Fantastic! I have a question: how is this possible?
Alan
He was amazing.
It was like that, this Bugs Bunny drawing where Bugs plays all the positions, no, but instead of Bugs, it was the first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base -...
I mean, it's like it's like he's teaming us up.
Yes, we did show these Hasidic jewelers something about the softball ..
Can I ask you guys a question? Did you ever think that Alan was maybe .. sometimes ..
What?
..I do not know, a little too much Alan?
Well no. It's impossible. You can never be so Alan.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that we love.
Personally, I could have a gallon of Alan.

Well, I had a good time! I learned to cook, I ate good food, it's the first A I have since the seventh year,
Oh look! Act for beginners! Do you want to feel good?
What is going on!
Okay.
Okay, let's start with some basics. Can anyone tell me what is the difference between the backstage and the backstage?
Yes, it was a stupid idea.

My God!
These pants are burning!
Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
What is she trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano here!
Are you hot?
Ok, it just must be me then.
It was just the pants on the couch. Uh, hey, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
You drive me crazy with that!
Ok, I will stop.
Do not stop! Move the bowl further! Ross could do that!
Well, you are afraid! But at least you're no good at a man's game now.
You want to play?
Chandler, I can not play games, Ross will be home soon.
And I have to write five full pages if I want to stick to his schedule.
So, play for the next 30 minutes, then write until he gets home.
Okay! But uh, listen, what are you saying we're going up a notch?
I am interested.
Okay, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful, because I want to recover our security deposit.
Yes, I think we said goodbye to that when we invented the dart game.
Do you even remember the part of the wall that does not spit?
Uh yes, right here.

Hi, Rachel. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like punch to death Tiki?
What is it?
Weeeell is rum, and-
I am sure they will be here soon.
Yes, honey, they would not miss that.
Relax. You are only nine centimeters away. And the baby is at the station zero.
You really scare me.
Someone wants to help me, trying to tear my heart. Uh, that's great. Someone saw a nipple?
Okay, ten centimeters, let's go.
All right, honey, it's time to start pushing.
But they are not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can not tell the baby to wait for them.
Oh my God.

Here we go. Mona uh, I think it's time we - we had a conversation about - where things are with us.
Yes, I-I think I suggested that.
Aw, we-we are so, so, uh, well I-I-I love you and I-I like uh, you know, hanging out with you
And I mean, I'm having a lot of fun.
Okay.
I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun.
It must be, it must go somewhere, is not it?
So where is he going?
Ah!
This is the real question.
And-and the answer is that it's going somewhere, it's fun.
Now, I -I know what you think, having fun was like ten years ago, you know, but you're not rejuvenating.
No I mean-Not you, not you, you
I'm sorry, so where are we?
You know what?
I'll take you dinner tonight.
I found this place that makes the biggest sticks of mozzarella and jalepino poppers.
No?
Really?
They taste so good.

Drum roll.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Help me! Am I a brand or a John?
No, you're not big enough to be a Mark, but you could make a good Barney.
Look, I'm serious, okay? Tomorrow at 15:30, I go to the courthouse.
Are you going through this?
Hey, listen, this name has been with me all my life.
Ok, that's probably why the kids harassed me at school and I never succeed with women. So, starting at 4 am tomorrow, I'll be either Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You have problems because of you!
Not your name!
Okay, it must stop!
Chandler is a big name!
In fact, yes, I'm sorry.
I know you really wanted me to name baby Joey, but huh, so, I-I'm, I'm going, I'll call baby Chandler.
Heck! I thought it was going to be romantic like hell!
It was.

Listen, I just saw the brains of my best friends smear the canvas, it's not going to be me, not me.
Wow! It was good. It was ... tweezers?
No.
Whoa. It was really good.
Thanks, suggestions?

Hi!
Have you slept with Ursula ?!
Uh, a little bit. She she came in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
You did not notice that she was wearing different clothes ?!
I was so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! You know what? It's so weird.
No-no it is not!
I do not want to lose you!
It's like I tell Ursula that I made love to her and that I thought she was you.
So I guess that's it.
Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You feel like her.
Yeah, you too.

Hey!
Hi.
So, did shopping make you feel better with Ross?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well,
You can?
Yeah. I just need you to bring me photos of Ross.
Um-hmm.
And a little piece of chocolate.
Okay.
Okay, we have to talk. I'm just coming out of a very serious relationship
I know! And I'm coming out of a marriage, I mean talking about destined to be!
Right! I just think it's happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too late. Look at it, I will not let you go this time.
I hear you. But! Unfortunately, my company transfers me abroad!
Oh no! Where to go To Paris?
No! No! Not Paris.
Too much London? No, no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
Ok, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm transferred to Yemen!
When?
I do not know exactly.
Ugh, well I'll just have to get hold of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I know it's sometime tomorrow.

Ooh, that's it! Oh it's him! It's him!
Awesome! Go and get it.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go first.
He is not really my type.
Not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what he looks like. People tell everything to doctors.
But you said he was that good guy!
But lately, all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, and then they turn out to be the biggest jerks
You attract stinkers.

Chandler.
Ms. Tedlock. You are beautiful today. And may I say, it's a
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to go to his office late in the day.
Oh, listen.
If it's about these stuffing memos, I have nothing to do with them.
Really.
Nothing at all.
Really.
Nothing.

You know, when we move in together, can I have a rubber dispenser?
Of course! Joey would not let you have one?
No. When it comes to candy, it is surprisingly strict.
Hey, did you find a way to tell him you're moving?
No, no, I keep trying, you know?
I can go out, "Joey, I have it too" but then I lose my courage and I always end up "going to the bathroom."
He may think that I am sick.
You know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I just have to finish!
You know, next time we'll see them, we'll tell them what.
Okay?
That's all.
Oh, so is it going to work now? Are you just going to order me all the time?
Rather.
Okay.
Hi Monica!
Hi!
Hey dude, do you feel better?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! You are pregnant!
Yes, if you get married in Vegas, you will only be married in Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you're getting married in Vegas, you're married everywhere.
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh my God! well

Do you see this guy? He's in the classics now, but you know, as soon as we leave, he goes straight to porn.
He will go up to the counter with
Yeah.
I missed that.
Me too.
So, you want a hamburger?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, you know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We will.
OK, Rachel, you want to put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
No Monday
Every year.

And
Hey! Ross!
Die hard
Yes. Hey, what do you say we make it a dual feature?
What did you rent?
Die Hard 2
Joey, it's
Oh, well we look a second time and his
Joey, we
And?
And it'll be cool to see him again! Yeah!
Die hard
Dude, you did not say
Yes, I just received plans.
John McClane had plans!
No, you see, I want to leave here before Joey gets angry and starts calling everyone slutty.
What are you talking about? Bitch.

I know you missed this operation on purpose.
I can not prove it yet, but when it does, you will go to jail for murder.
I do not care if you are my brother.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your article on punctuated balance in the Devonian era was top notch!
Stop browsing my stuff!
Hey!
Hey!
I just wanted you to know that I changed my mind: I'm going to do it, I'm going to kiss Joey.
No you can not! Contacts with friends are a bad idea.
Please, and you and Chandler?
It's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Hello Hello
What about all the guys whose phone numbers you have? Why do not you kiss one of them?
I could, I could but I do not want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Okay I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I will do it.
And I can not stop you.
No.
Hey Rach, did you see Charlie somewhere?
I am smarter than

Oh, hello, Gunther, look at that.
Yeah, it's Chandler who makes me laugh.
Hey Ross, listen, you want to drink something, because I'm going there.
Uh, yes, I'll have a coffee. Thanks dude.
Sure. Coffee? Because I go there.
No.
No thanks.
You need anything, because I go there.
I would like an icy water.
You got it.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just be friendly.
Joey, honey, I do not think you're supposed to go back there.
Nah, it's good. That's it, Gunther?
Do not give me a wink. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I do not see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
Joey, are you working here?
No.
Hey, waiter.
Yeah?

You joined Monica and Chandler, if you listen to this message, we'll probably be sifting through. Yes we are.
Hello, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase Museum.
I'm calling for Monica Geller.
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she is still interested in the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
It's Chandler Bing! It's Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-no! Not the groom !!

Thank you.
Thank you.
I can not believe that! It's like the worst night of my life!
You know Monica, your relationship with Chandler has had a slight setback. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am
It's crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I do not even want to see Richard again.
So go fix it!
Go find Chandler!
He is probably in your room!
Tell him that you are sorry and that you love him.
You know what? You're right Phoebe. You are right. Thank you!
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Someone lost that?
Comin 'out. Place your bet. The dice are out. Double or nothing! Pay the front line!
Hmm.

Do you remember where is the duck food?
Yes, it's in the apartment of guys under the sink. Why?
Because I'm going to London.
What?! What do you mean you go to London?
Yes, I must tell Ross that I love him.
Now, honey, take care of yourself, you do not have those babies until I get back.
I-Rachel, you can not go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves all the information so he can make an informed decision.
That's not why you go!
You go there because you hope he'll say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
Forget this British chippy. "
Ohh-Do you think he'll do it ?!
No!
Because he is in love with the British chippy!
Listen, Rachel, if you go, you'll just make fun of her head and ruin her marriage!
You know, it's too late!
You missed your chance!
I'm sorry, I know it must be really hard, it's over.
You know what? No, it's not over until someone says, "Me yes".
I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, how can I really chase you. I'm wearing a litter.

So everyone is here?
I arrived a little early myself.
Let's start.
The hydrosaurids were found at two main locations.
Right here.
Right here.
Now as for hydrosaurs

Anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is that I should have taken your feelings into account before going home with you that night.
I have ah, I recently learned how it feels to be on your side, and I'm sorry.
So, you think you can forgive me?
Awesome.
Thank you.
Okay goodbye.
Hello Jennifer?
Oh hello, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer here?
Oh, she's not home, huh?
Well, actually, I need to talk to you too.

Hey!
Hi.
Are you doing OK?
Uh ... I think I just got engaged.
Oh my God! He did it?
Well ... did you know he was going to ask me?
Are you kidding?
I am like the one who convinced him.
I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
And you really think it's a good idea?
I just talk to him, do not tell me I have to do it too. The puppet master tires people.
I do not know! That does not seem right to me.
Why?! You two are so made to be together, everyone thinks so.
Really?! Even Ross?
Especially Ross!
Oh, hi Pheebs. Uh, what do you know? I will come back later.
Wow! A bit like a packed house here. I guess right ... I'll come back.
There he is, your fiancee.
I suppose.
Although he plays with himself in his sleep.
I can not say that I am surprised.

Oh, it's so unfortunate.
What?
A cute and naked guy really starts to put on weight.
Okay, I'll be back in a minute. Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry I left traces of lipstick on the phone.
You did not leave any traces of lipstick on the phone.
Oh, so it must have been you. Goodbye.
Bye! That's why I moved.
Hey, you know, when we talk about it, when are you going to tell my sister that you do not live here anymore?
I think at some levels she already knows.
Night Mon Night Julio.
Adios.
Look Julio, someone left his book here.
Oh, it's mine.
Oh yes, what are you reading?
Flowers of evil, by Beaudalire. Did you read it?
Did I read it? No, you take advantage?
I thought so, but the translation is not good.
You are a poet and you do not know it.
In fact, I am a poet.
Oh, so you know it. So, uh, what kind of things do you write?
Things that affect me. The, the shadow of a tree, a laughing child, or that lip.
Mine? Right here?
I can write an epic poem on this lip.
How would it go? Well, it did not rhyme, but I liked it.

Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
I bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
What?
We are at my stop. But would you like to have a coffee?
Are we really in Montreal ?!
Yes we are. So, coffee?
The coffee sounds good. Wait, then, do you live in Montreal?
Oh no. But it only takes two hours of ferry to get to Nova Scotia.

Ok, here is lot 22.
Oh, maybe they'll taste a bit of your grandmother's.
It has a little orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Let's give a shot.
Okay. Man, I have
Oh, what was it for? Do you like a bake sale?
No, just a Friday night.
Would she?
Would she? You have eaten my chocolate bar!

Oh my God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I want to quit, but I think I should hold on, then I wonder why such a person would stay in such degrading work just because it's related to the area of ​​interest.
Gee, I do not know Rachel. Order up !! I have a Yentel soup, a James bean and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I do not have ...
I do not mind paying my dues, you know, that's all I'm going to learn about fashion by driving Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Hi! My misery amuses me?
I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah ....
It's not funny, it's actually my job.
Oh, believe me, I-I-I was there. I had to sort the mannequin heads at this Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, I'm just going back to talking to my friend here.
And you can start enjoying your little hamburger again.
Ah, just another thing.
Yes?!
I am, I work at
Do you want my pickle?

Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Why?
I just want to check my horoscope, see if it's right.
Oh my God.
Phoebe
Do not look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our heart and plunge into a pit of depression.
Or? Ooh, come to mom.
He is coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
We should do something. Whistle.
We will not whistle.
Go do it.
No!
Do it!
No!
Do it, do it!
Woo woo!
I can not believe you did that!

Hi! Uh, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro.
Again?
I think the things you said about me are really unfair and I would like you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
I do not see any reason why I would do this situation.
Either eat it, or be in it.
Spoon? So what do you think?
I am torn between my integrity and my desire to avoid blows. But I must be honest, your soap is abominable.
It's a girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there is a new class coming
Welcome to the introduction to the kitchen. Before you start, can anyone tell me the difference between a Dutch sauce and a Béarnaise sauce?
I can.
Okay, keep going.
Well, uh, they both have an egg yolk and a butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, lawns and especially tarragon.
That's fine, what's your name?
Monica
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Okay.

And there is a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I have never seen.
But I'm told that for fifty pesos, you can buy a human spleen.
Humaaan spleeeeen.
Olè!
What are you doing here!
Well, you said you had customers lined up on the street, so I'm here to entertain!
Awesome!
Yeah!
It's really great too, you know, some of these people already had to see me play because they asked for a bunch of my songs!
Yeah, "you're bad" and "shut up and go home".
Listen Phoebe ...
Yeah.
You know how much I like listening to your music, you know, but ...
But what?
It's a bit of a chic place.
Ok, do not say more.

I'm totally bored! Stupid rain, we ... we can not do anything.
Well, I brought some books. We could read.
Hey, he has not got to that yet.
Hey hey! I do not mind if I do it!
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmacy convention
Hey Rach, do you want to go to a convention?
We can not We are not pharmacists!
I know we are not, but Frank Medeio and ... Eva Trorro ... womba ...
Kate Miller?
Kate Miller is.
And ... it's the most sex I'm having this weekend.
In this case, should I make sure it's really good?
Thank you.

Oh my God!
We heard about your pants, I'm sorry.
This year was supposed to be great!
But it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that do not even suit me!
No, you are not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You are a cowboy!
Oh, because of the leather pants.
See? Ben do not think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now it's something.
Yeah!
It's really something. it's really cool.
Howdy partner!
Maybe I should have another pair!
Ooh, you know, they had them with fringes on all sides.
I'll go and kiss Ben goodnight.
I can not believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.
Ok, now that everything is over, I think I'll do my laundry.
Oh yes, me too. You know if this shirt is dirty. Yes.
No you did not do it You said you would, but you never did it!
Oh yes!

Great nap.
It was really.
Uh me? Gay? No! No, but I have several close friends who are.
So let's talk about women. I'm sure our readers will be interested in knowing your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, as I do, I look at a woman from top to bottom and say, "Hey, how are you?"
Oh please!
Hey, how are you?

Hey Mikey
Hey p
What are you doing?
Setting up rat traps.
To kill Bob ??
No, no, to test his neck strength.
No, Mike, I do not want to kill him!
I thought we were just going to capture him and, and you know, free him in the countryside where he might meet a friend and a crazy owl.
Ok, ok, I'm going to throw the traps.
I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
Bob?
Bob!
Robert!
Oh, wait, I think I heard it.
Oh - Oh my god!
Bob had babies!
Bob is a mom!
Better to think of a new name for him.
I do not know, I like Bob for a girl.
I do not know, I mean I'm not sure ...
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Maybe it was not Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Suzie?

Hmmm, the soup!
Joey, Ross is going to be in a second, do you want to watch Ben for me while I'm using the ladies' room?
Oh yes, no problem.
Thank you.
Hi Ben! So you want to be an actor, huh? I have to tell you it's not a picnic. There are tons of rejection.
Joey!
Which? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yes, but he waited until the last minute!
So, if I said yes, he would know that I have nothing better to do than to wait for an invitation to his stupid feast.
I said no!"
Who puts
Awesome. So the ball is in his camp?
Ball? There is no ball.

Oh, hello Rachel! I thought we said seven?
Yeah, uh, you know what, let's go.
What?! Why?!
Umm, you and your sister seem to have had a very special connection, and
Oh great! This
Okay. I do not know, listen, I do not know what's going on here but
Do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them?
No, no, they are not very nice people.
Ok, listen, I really love you a lot.
Okay?
I think it can go somewhere.
So, if I'm close to my family, are you going to let that bother us?
Well, I-I do not know. See when-when you say it that way you know it's sort of
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
What?
Yeah, okay, see you later.

It's finish.
Oh, it was awful?
Well, it was long.
I did not even realize what time it was late, until I noticed the five-hour shadow on his head.
In any case, she did not want to stay.
I called a taxi; she just left.
I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
It's just some things I thought about.
Some things about us, and even before we can think of getting together, I need to know what you think about that.
Okay. Wow, it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better crack for this baby.
Well, I'll wait for you, come when you're done.
Ok, I'll be in, 18 pages. Front and rear. Very exciting.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said we except the
Okay, I'll retract.
But I maintain my criticism, I know the food and it's not that.
Your marinara sauce tastes like tomato juice!
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I'm proud of this sauce, it's delicious.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think it's good ?! Where do you come from?
Lebanon.
Give me these tomatoes, I'll show you what it looks like! Come on, pass them to them.
How long will it take? Because I have another critic to scream.

Ok, so what happened?
Ohh Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You will have your turn!
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Nothing! It is not finished!
No! No! No!
What?!
I spent all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now everything is covered in. Actually, thank you!
Okay! Everyone ready to go to the movies?
Uh, actually, I think I'm going to skip it.
Really?
Yes, I will stay and read my book. I just want to be alone right now.
Oh. Are you sure you do not want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they receive mail and stuff.
It's ok, Joe.
Okay, let's go Pheebs.
Oh my God!

It was great.
I know.
Hey, do you realize that we have just changed our lives forever?
We may have just started a family.
In nine months we can be here and have our own baby.
And if not, we must do it on a bucket.

Ross! You must stop! Okay?! You can not just look through the peephole for three hours! You will have an eye!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I always knew she liked him!
You know, she would say no, but here we are!
Right?
We just broke up, first thing she does!
You have not just broken up.
Hey, it's been three weeks!
You slept with someone three hours after thinking about breaking up. I mean the bullets have left the weapons more slowly!
It's Bill Clinton.
Who is he huggin?
Oh my God! It's Pete! But why Bill huggin 'Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses this program!
We use it !!
Here!!
Oh my God, Monica is going out with a millionaire.
I will not go out with him.
Oh my God, I can not believe it's a real $ 20,000 check, oh that's so exciting.
Or incredibly offensive.
Oh yes, of course, that too.
What?

Hey, so, uh, do you know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yes!
You know how I'm trying to solve the problem with Emily.
Well, there is one thing Ok, that's it.
I promised that - Oh hey!
What?
Your nose is bleeding!
Oh my God.
No!
Oh not yet!
This happened when my grandfather passed away.
It's yuck!
Sorry.
Oh, all right, so I'm sorry, what did you want to say, what did you want to tell me?
Umm
Sorry. Sorry.
Ok, I can not see you anymore.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can not see you either.

Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hello, chip.
Hey, Rachel! It's okay'?
I'm awesome! I'm awesome. I have a great job at
So ah, is Monica ready?
She will be out in a second. So, Chip, how are you, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Wow! I have not seen her since ... So, Monica, are you ready?

That's right, I love you! And-and I'll play with you all the time.
How can you let him talk to your crotch like this?
He talks to the baby.
Ohh!
Okay!
Ok, because when-when he said, "I can not wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's something."
Okay. Well, I have to go guys. I will see you later.
Okay.
Oh my, oh my God!
Aw, it's amazing!
Wow!
She gives so many kicks!
Oh, she's like uh oh who's that kind of annoying soccer player?
Mia Hamm?
Mia Hamm!
Oh, it's amazing.
Oh oh !! A hand on the Joe sheet!
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!

Okay, what do you think?
Guy!
I have never known love like that.
Do you really like that?
Guy! How did you write that?
I stole Monica and changed the name.
You can not
If he goes first he can!

Hey!
Yeah!
Anyway, I - I still think we should try to fix things, see?
Like, uh, maybe we could buy tickets for another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow it's a good idea! And
Here you are.
Oh.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
Here you are.
You know I have to tell you, sometimes I think I do not understand Chandler.
You know, me and he do things all the time without you and you do not get angry.
All the time?
All the time!

Cassie, how are you doing on this hot dog.
I am all done.
Thank God.
I guess the last time we really dragged out was when our parents rented this beach house together.
Oh yes.
Right.
Do you remember the time I pinned and tickled you until you cried?
We are probably too old to do it now.
I will always remember this summer because it was when I had all those freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember this summer because that's when I realized we were connected.
It took you so long to understand it, huh?
Well, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.

Relax each muscle of your body.
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
Ok, now close your eyes and think of a happy place.
Okay, tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Okay. No, no, no, not something Richard, just put the glass. And go out!
I'm sorry, but it's my happy place.
Okay, use my happy place.
Ok, I'm just right, I have to ask that you do not move anything.
Okay, I'll try not to do it.
Okay, all right, you're in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky ...
Do you think that breaking with him was a huge mistake?
Okay, there are no questions in this happy place. Okay, just the warm breeze and the moonlight running through the trees ....
I bet he's totally on me, I bet he's fine.
Very good, bets and bets of all kinds are not allowed, I am sure, in this happy place.
Okay.
Just, you know, the beautiful waterfalls and the flowing fountains.
And the soothing sound of the bubbling brook ...
Ok, it does not work. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.

OK sweetheart, see you later.
See you later, Rach.
Goodbye Julie.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, come on, cut it off.
Hey?
What?
Can I ask you something?
Hey Rach, do you want to hear the new song that I'm thinking of singing this afternoon? I wrote this morning in the shower.
Okay.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see you for a minute?
What's up?
F.Y.I ..
I decided to pay a professional musician to play on Sunday afternoon.
Her name is Stephanie ... something.
She is supposed to be very good.
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is mean, but so much it makes me want to put my finger in my eye in my brain and make it turn.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, you can not do that to him.
Uh ...
Oh no no no no Oh no no no no I have to do this to him?

Ahh no
Oh.
Are you jealous?
No, I know I do not see why she has to play with you, that's all.
I mean, does not she have any other friends of the strippers mother?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous.
Okay, it's about people feeling some things about strippers.
And you know, and um, I ...
Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait wait.
What?
Huh.
Well, there's a kiss he will not forget for a few hours, you know.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turn it on and send it to a stripper.

I can not believe you came back.
Do not say anything.
I do not want to talk, I do not want to think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me here and now.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
You missed the exit!
Oh sorry.
My God, what were you thinking?
Uh, Barry.
Awwww !!

I just thought I thought you were doing it, I did not know you were in love!
Guy!
And hat to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And could I say that your breasts are still visible?
God!
Okay! So that's it! It's finish! Everyone knows!
In fact, Ross does not know it.
Yes, and we would appreciate it if nobody told him yet.

Dear Mary-Angela.
Hi.
How are you.
This is the most difficult letter I have ever had to write.
What's wrong with you?
How do you think Joey will react when he finds out that you ripped off his sister with a letter?
Well, this is the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When will I actually be in Cuba?
Okay, listen, listen, you have to do it yourself, okay in person.
At least you know his name.
You're just going home and you're asking Mary-Angela, okay, when she comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you drop her gently.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and asks Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?

Hey.
You may have been right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Uh, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
Okay.
Ok, that's it. I have two queens, what do you have?
One two and five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Oh yes! Ok, let's play again. What do you have?
A four and a nine.
You're kidding, are not you?
No why?
Well, it's a full cup!
Heck! I am good in Cup!

What? Why? Where are you?
I'm always on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! I am sorry! The guy is drunk, they will not let me go before we have this.
Oh my God! I will have to find another minister.
No! No, I am the minister! Well, look, put both on the phone, I'll marry them right away.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Do not hang up! I'm going to marry you and me now! I have the power!

Oh hi Joey! What's up?
I can not decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you traveled a lot, did not you?
Yes, I have been around.
Ok, no matter which road should I take the North Road or the South Road?
Ooh, if you take the road north, there is a man in Illinois with a bee stubble.
Okay, I have to protest, I've lived all my life in Illinois and I do not know any man with a bee stubble!
Wisconsin, on the other hand, could be a different story.
Awesome! Problem solved!
Estelle, you must find me work. I lost my health insurance.
Okay, the first thing to do is to limit the damage.
Why?
Well, I think someone may have criticized you badly in town.
Asshole!

You mean every time Monica and Chandler do the laundry or do their shopping or -Oh!
Monica spent all this time on the phone with sad Linda from the camp!
Uh-huh, do it. I do it. Phone do it.
Oh!
Oh, I can not believe it!
I mean, I think it's great!
For him.
She could perhaps do better.
Hi guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
Phoebe has just discovered Monica and Chandler.
You mean how are they friends and nothing more?
No Joey, she
Ok, so now they know you know and they do not know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but you know what?
It does not matter who knows what.
Now enough of us know that we can tell them we know!
Then all lies and secrets would finally be over!
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided he was gay, moved out and abandoned his entire family.

You know you're a friend getting married, you have to change things.
Do you really think it would be so different?
How could it be otherwise?
I mean very soon, they are going to have children and then they will just go out with other couples who have children.
And then maybe they'll have to leave the city to be near a
Well, things are changing.
I do not want them to move into a
It's okay Joe.
It's always there!
Ms. Braverman must be outside.
She could be out of town. Maybe she will be gone for months.
By then, the cheese cake may have gone bad. We do not want her to come back to the wrong cheesecake.
No, it could kill her.
Well, we do not want that.
No, so we protect it.
But we should take it.
But we should act quickly.
Why?
Because I think I just heard him moving there.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Hey, Kicky. What are you doing?
I'm just trying to make myself comfortable. I can not sleep in my underwear.
Well, you go.
I was thinking. You know, I always see girls above girls ...
Are they end to end or big like pancakes?
You know what I mean, about how I always go out with all these women.
And I always thought that when the good come, I'll be able to stand up and go far, you know?
Now, I look at my dad, thinking ...
Hey, you are not him.
You are you
When they were all on you to go into your father's pipe business, did you give in?
No.
No.
You have decided to embark on the job of unemployed actor.
Now it was not easy, but you did it!
And I'd like to believe that when the good woman comes along, you'll have the courage and the courage to say, "No thanks, I'm married."
Do you really think that?
Yeah. I really do.
Thank you, Chandler.
Get off!

Hi.
Your Alfredo Fettuccini looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a snack before cooking?
And the cream?
The cheese makes me thirsty.
Okay. Let's move on.
Okay.
Oh! Something smells good at Monica! Oh my God! It's absolutely amazing! Have you never done this before?
Oh no!
I do not know anything about cooking.
I had to ask someone what's the name when when the water makes these little bubbles.
Well, hat to the chef.
I-I'm sorry, your mouth was full, I did not hear what you said Umm, hat to whom now?
Leader!
It is true.

Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.
How is it going?
Well. Oh oh! Roger has a dinner and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
Nothing, it's just, uh ... it's Roger.
I do not know, there's just something about ...
Basically, we think it's ...
We hate this guy.
Yeah. The hate.
We're sorry, Pheebs, sorry.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay, you may not think so, though, it's just that he's so insightful that it scares you
... No, we hate him.
We are sorry.

Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
I return all those things that Chandler bought for guilt.
Yes it was mine.
Because I thought you had a girl and she left it there.
Yes, it would have made more sense.
You know, I do not even feel like I know you dude anymore!
Look, I'm just going to ask you this once.
And whatever you say, I will believe you.
Were you or were you not on a gay cruise?
!

Oh hey! There are children playing in the street, you want to go give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a bullet, maybe you can stick some razor blades in and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
What did she say?
She said, "If I'm not happy to get married somewhere that we find in a day, well, we should just postpone it."
The reporter?
Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent for this wedding?
Does the tiny brain of my sister, my sister, understand that people have taken thousands of miles to get here, huh?
It's not good.
I realize that people will be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
I can not ask people to do that? Do you want to ask people to do it?
Do not point your pants on me!
We have no choice!
Wherever half decent would have been reserved months ago, Ross, do not you understand?
It's our marriage that I'm talking about.
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. It's when we get married.
So, what are you saying? It's now or never?
No, I say it's now.
Or?
There is no 'or' in the mind. What's the problem with these pants? !!
It's not the pants.
It's you who is upside down.
And if, and if you do not understand how important it is to me, well, then maybe we should not get married at all!
No wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please.

Hello Darling.
See you later.
What? I bought food, I was going to prepare you for dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait until I ask you!
Hello, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase Museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she is still interested in the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
Oh please, he did not hear it! He did not hear that !!
It's Chandler Bing! It's Chandler Bing!
NOOOO !!!!!!!!

My! What are you doing here?
I came to give you this and that.
Oww! Big ring!
Yes all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Are you talking about me?
Yes all the time.
Really?
But uh, we just call you Bobo the type of sperm.

Would you like to watch this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much shit?
In fact, I think this apartment defiles the good name of shit
Look at this. Can I have this?
What?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, jumped, jumped, jumped.
Suddenly, Leon, the manager, calls me in his office.
It turns out that they fired the lunch leader and guess who got the job.
If it's not you, it's a horrible story.
Fortunately it's me.
And, they made me the head of shopping, thank you very much.
Anyway, I just found Ross and Chandler downstairs and they think we should go party.
You know, a nice place.
Yes, a nice place.
Yeah!
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?

So what do you think?
I think it's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
So, how does it work, you will balance the plates on the heads of these little guys?
We do not care, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Heads up Ross! Goal! You are afraid!

What is this?
Thank you. Put you at ease.
I got you.
This place is really my grandmother.
I got it when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
So, if the owner asks, I am an 87 year old woman who is afraid of her VCR.
So are you thirsty?
Oh, you say I am!
Ok, here is your penis!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
How was your first day?
Oh okay.
Oh God, what a nice surprise! It's such a beautiful house.
Thank you, it's my mother. So it's cooking.

Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Awesome! How about going to the Italians in Bleaker Street, right?
Ooh, I love this place! So no.
What about mom Lisettie?
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long has this milk come out?
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
It's milk is mine.
I bought it today because I was thirsty for milk, you know.
Okay let's go!
Hey buddy! Do you know Article 11-B of the French Health Code which requires that all waste be refused?
But then I should go around the dry cleaner.
Oh, so you say you would prefer convenience to health ?!
Ok, stop!
Larry, all right, you can not just be Larry and not Larry, the health inspector?
You know I mean it was really exciting at first, but now it's like, okay, so where are we going to eat?
Well, I guess I could give him a warning.
Thank you.
Ok, come on!
Go!
Go!
Now, if after dinner you still really need to break someone, I know a hot dog salesman who takes his nose.

No! No! Phoebe, come on! I do not want to change! Please come! I can throw wet towels here!
No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. I am sorry.
Everything is fine! It seems so much fun.
Yeah.
God, what a waste.

Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost.
A little girl lent her uniform to her nineteen-year-old sister, who went to the United States.
Nimitz and sold more than 2,000 boxes.
Hey! How was the interview?
Oh, I ruined everything. I would not even have hired me.
Oh, come here my darling, listen, you'll continue as a thousand interviews before finding a job.
That's not how it should happen.
It's the worst Christmas of my life.
You know what Rachel, you should maybe tell you, stay here at the cafe.
I can not!
It's too late!
Terry has already hired this girl there.
Look at her, she even has a waitressing experience.
Last night, she taught everyone how to make a napkin ... swans.
This word was swans.

What do we have here?
A piece of something: underpants, greeting cards and what looks like a half-carbonized image-Wow, this guy is hairier than the chef!
You know, it's a really funny story how it went.
Its good.
Its good.
You do not have to explain.
This is not the first bonfire of a boyfriend that we have seen become uncontrollable.
You are our third call tonight.
Really?
Oh, of course, Valentine's Day is our busiest night of the year.

I'm so sorry, guys. I did not want to kill you.
No, you were right. I do not have a plan.
Thank God. Food.
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I do not even have a "pl".
No, no, that's not what we ordered ... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Expect! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Wait, was he a small, curious looking guy from the Mediterranean?
Was he wearing a gorgeous blue suit?
And-and a link of strength?
Oh my God.
Are you crazy?! We have the pizza of George Stephanopoulos!
Uh, Pheebs? Who is George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
I see a pizza!
Oh, I want to see! Let me see! Let me see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?

Hey, do you know what a good rainy day is?
What?!
I mean the naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
No no!
What are you crazy ?!
Come on! When you leave, you have to play, it's like a law!
All is done!
AWW thank you.
Ok, who's next ?!
No-o-o! No way!
Come please?! I am boredddd! You let me do it once before.
Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend ... No!

It's beautiful! It's as if the first floor of the bathroom had ever existed. Whoa! Are you going there for?
What, like a number?
Hey!
Hi! Goodbye!
Ok, I have finished my choices, these are final.
Well, it's time.
Ooh, very official.
Oh, yes, you know that Chandler printed it on his computer.
And who laminated it?
It would be me.
Okay, let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer and Dorothy Hammel?
Hey, this is my list.
All right darling, you realize she's only running like that on the ice.

Ok, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the
Hi! And what class do you go to?
Umm, I'm actually a freshman, but I understand a lot, you see, I-I'm graduating early
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should have said that I would need an adult doctor.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified for
Hush!
Doogie, hush!
Does anyone not understand that I will soon have babies?
Huh?
Go!
Go boy, go!
Oh cool! You made her cry!

Hey, there are people outside asking questions about sweets.
Well, they'll have to wait, will not they? I only have two hands !!
Need help?
No! You do not know the system! Nobody will play with the system!
Your license please.
You do not want to hear about my dream, Agent Pretty?
It is little. I will be back with your ticket.
You have a son!
I know. I know.

Uh, like, could these margaritas
Good morning, Mr. Bing.
I loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Thank you. Listen to the weekly numbers, I'm going to need it on my desk
Sure.
No problem.
You have to give them something, you know.
Ok, now it was Gerston, Santos, and who is the guy with the mustache?
Petrie.
Petrie, okay, okay. Okay, some people are going to work

....right?
Right?
I mean it's pretty amazing you know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.
You know I do not need it, I do not need it, huh, I have you now as friends, Susan and you.
Ah, Susan will be delighted.
717? Where is 717? Hey, you have more for Susan, right?
No, but I'm fine, I'm just going to get pickles or something.
Ross, thank you god.
Pheebs? Why are you whispering?
I ate an insect.
Hi Rachel, tampons only represent a penny. Let's do the stock.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas and we do not know where we are, so we can not get a tow truck.
Oh, now you want a favor?
Yes please.
Well, I'm sorry, your car broke down, but I'm a little too busy with some of my true friends, but call me to let me know that you're safely home, okay?
Phoebe, wait a second. Here, take my car, go get your friends.
No, I will not look for them.
Listen, we both know you're going to do it because you're not a fool.
Okay?
So you can either sulk here for half an hour then go get them, or save time and sulk in the car.
No, Rachel does not want me ...
Listen, I-I'm-I'm sorry that Rachel dumped you because she fell in love with that guy Mark, and you're the innocent victim in all of this, but do not punish your friends for what Rachel did you made.
Yes you are right.

God, I feel so guilty towards Ross.
Oh, I know.
I feel like it's my fault.
Type of? If you kept that for yourself, none of that would have happened.
Well, I keep so many things for myself these days, something was sure to escape!
Well, I think what you said is very courageous.
Okay, I can not sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? What about the animal rights issue?
Well, I read and for your information, the mink are not very nice.
Ok, I admit it!
I love this coat!
Ok, that's the best thing I've ever had around me, including Phil Huntley!
Do you remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine!

So, your father is gone. He is a nice man!
Oh no
I better leave. (She will sit in the
Ross, I'm so sorry. Okay. I promise to solve the problem with him tomorrow in person or by email
I do not care about your father! I care about Mona! She was there and now she is completely panicked!
Oh, I'll fix that. What is his e-mail address?
Rachel!
Okay, I promise you. I will fix it. I swear. I'm going, I'm going, I'll talk to him.
Okay!
Okay.
Thank you!
That's all?!
You call that a fight?
Come on!
"We were at the break!"
"No we were not!"
What happened to you both?
!

Hello, could we have two burritos, please?
I am sorry.
But not sorry, because you do not have to live with it.
We have a reservation under the name of Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Fourty-five minutes? We have tickets for the
I am sorry. Christmas is a busy time, sir.
Is it because of the burrito?
You must give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to have a table! Places like this are always discouraged. Everyone wants to get paid.
Well, calm down, O'Mally. I'm going to drag him some money.
You must be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.
Listen, we're a little in a hurry, so if you could get us a picture a little faster, I'd appreciate it.
Of course sir.
Okay.
I'd better go back to my office.
Okay, you work hard! I will remember to put that in your assessment.
My what?
Well, it's been two months since you've been here and your boss is required to submit an assessment of his performance.
But you know, there is one thing I have not evaluated yet.
Are you serious?
No, I always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean that?

I can dry it.
I can put gel on it.
No matter, I always end up with that little cowlicky thing in the middle of my head.
It's so boring.
Does it bother you?
You're making me angry.
Is there a chance you have not seen that?

Hey Joey, what are you doing?
Sweep. Why? Turn you on?
No.
Huh. What if I swept a chimney?
Joey, did
Where are you going? The vicar will not be home for hours.
Joey, where did you hear that word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
Did you find my book ?!
Yes I did!
Joey, what are you doing in my room ?!
Ok, listen, I'm sorry, I went for a nap and I know I should not, but you have porn!
Hey hey, what do you know?
I do not care!
I am not ashamed of my book.
There is nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little eroticism.
It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which you will never understand.
You have porn!

Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want shortbread? Hey, it's Scottish like you.
Oh no thanks. I do not like
What?!
Well it's just that my whole family was chased out of Scotland by the Vikings. Anyway, a lot of bad memories.
Well, it seems to me that your family is ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.
No!
No-no they are not.
They are always very angry!
But you know that Chandler is also half Swedish.
Do you know what the Swedish people are famous for?
Sit down and be quiet.
Well yeah yeah the Scottish story is so much more
You can not play the bagpipes at the wedding!
How did you know about this ?!

Hi!
Hi!
Come in.
Thank you for coming, uh, all right, there were a lot of people interested in the play, but I reduced it and
Awesome!
Well, now, before making my final decision, I just want to make sure our personalities match.
Okay, so I did a little test.
Now, I'm going to say a word, and then you say the first thing that comes to your mind.
I can do it.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Fight.
Very well! Okay. G.
Chain?
Excellent! Ok, uh, dog.
Kitten?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but bye!

Dad, please, do not bite here!
Okay, and if you want to get up, why do not you sit on the-
Monica, leave him alone
Do you want to hurry?
You did not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers ?!
And that they will drink a lot!
?
No, but do it again because it's so romantic.
Well, you are so slow! Can not you do it faster?
Joey!
Come on!
I do not want to make mistakes, okay?
This is the only dessert and if I shit everyone is going to be like 'Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel fucking the trifle?
So why do not you let me worry about trifling and eating, okay?
Oh, I am!
Ross, if you do not tell them, then I'll do it!
Ok, alright!
Ross! May I speak to you for a second?
Oh, can that wait a second Joey? I have to say something to my parents. No it can not? Okay.

You're too cute! How did you come to be so cute?
Well, my grandfather was Swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny bunny.
Ok, now you are even more cute !!
You know it's a popular opinion today, I must say.
What?
The strangest thing happened at the café, I think, I think Phoebe was dragging me.
What are you talking about?
I tell you that I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
It is not possible!
Ow!
I'm sorry, Phoebe always thought you were charming, asexually.
Oh, you know, I do not hear enough.
I'm sorry, I think you just understand it.
No, I did not misunderstand, okay? She was all about me! She touched my biceps to shout loudly!
This biceps?
Well, it's not bent for now!

It's Phoebe.
Uh, well I have some bad news, can I enter?
Uh, well, grandma is dead.
No, she just died today! Ok, we have a memorial service tomorrow.
No you did not do it!
And many people! Look, are you coming to the memorial service or not?
Well. Ok, enjoy your concert.

Anyway, his name is Allan and we have been going out for three years.
He was my first client when I became a party organizer.
He was preparing a party for his girlfriend at the time.
Never mind.
And he was Theta Beta Pi in Syracuse.
Oh. Oh that's great!
Oh, you're one of
Really? Like what?
Well, you know, we would repeat everything the other said, or we would jump out of the closet to scare ourselves, or change the sugar to salt so they put salt on their cereal.
It's a good one.
Yeah? Do you like that one?
Yes, you are funny.
I am funny?
Oh thank you, God!
Well, I have a ton!
Uh, oh here-you want a good one?
Here is a good one.
Uh, you take a quarter, a quarter and you blacken the edge.
Right?
And then you tell no one, I bet you can not roll that area from your forehead to your chin without leaving your face.
And when they do, they have a big black pencil line in the center of their faces.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I'm-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?

Chloe? Hi..
Is it me who take your watch?
Did you take my watch?
I'm sorry, I'm doing this.
You keep it, listen, did you tell someone about us?
Oh no. I think it's not really anyone's business, you know.
Oh, another thing. Hoshi thinks my presence in the ring could affect my concentration.
Yeah. That was the problem.

Excuse me, Doug? Hey there, sports fan !!
Bing! Do you have these numbers for me?
So are you still in contact with someone from high school?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and uh, I think that's it. And you?
Oh yes, I always stay with Simmons and Zana, you know.
I see Spindler a lot.
Devane, Kelly and I meet Goldie from time to time.
Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
Is that all?
Hey, after high school, you just lose touch. Oh yes! I met Richard Dorfman.
Ohh, how is he?
Not so well, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Is not he an architect now?
Yes, they still wear underwear.

So the guy from Porsche got his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I loved how it feels when everyone thinks I own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you wear the clothes?
Really?!
Oh yes! Yeah, so you ran into Richard! You took a bite! It's not a big deal.
Awesome!
Okay, london 1

Hey, my, I was just doing the dishes!
Hey!
Oh! It's you. Hi.
And me?! You just said that I could!
I will not even get married! Ok, that's a question for science fiction writers!
I can not believe you do not choose me.
Hey, how can he
I'm not even I'm not even
Well, you know what, that's all. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Yes! Shame on you guy.

Eh eh! Stanley! Eh eh! You lead the man is here! Let's get to work.
Umm, slight change of plan. We closed.
Wh-what ?! Why?!
It's a matter of money, we do not have one.
You're kidding, are not you?
No.
What?!
It's probably just temporary. We hope to have more money soon, so if you could just relax.
Uh, go out ?! How long?
I do not know.
One week?
Maybe two?
The money will arrive!
People will always want to invest in movies!
Hey, you're not rich, are you?
No!
Hey, it's worth it. Look at Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Hey buddy, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yeah.
These are gone for you.
Thank you. Congratulations on your big break.

Rachel, do you still have muffins?
Yes, I forget which ones.
Oh, you're busy, I'm fine, I'll get it. Someone else wants one?
Hey.
Hey!
So, how was Joan?
I broke with her.
Do not tell me because of the big nostril?
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew away.
Come on, they were not so huge.
I tell you, she leaned back; I could see his brain.
How many perfectly good women will you reject for the most superficial insignificant things?
Hold it, hold it.
I have to join Chandler for this one.
When I came to town for the first time, I went out several times with this girl, very hot, who kisses well, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
It drove me crazy.
You or me?
J? I understood. Um, Joey, women do not have Adam's apples.
You do not care about me, do you?
Yeah.
It was a good one. For a second, I thought "whoa".

Oh my God, he lost it. He totally lost it.
What?
Or! Or we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them at the source.
You are a genius!
Aww, man, now we will not be friends of the bank anymore!
Now, there are two reasons.
Hey.
Hey!
Oh, do you remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Or?!
On the touchy.
And
No, I know!
I'm sorry, but as soon as I touch it, I just want to throw my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, the next time you massage, you should try to distract yourself.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like when I'm doing something exciting and I do not want to have
Thank you Joey.
No-no, thank you

Hey Estelle, listen
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They
What are you talking about? I never left you! You have always been my agent!
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh well, no harm, no fault.
Ok, are you free tonight?
Yeah!!
Tonight? You did not say it would be night.

Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Yes, we were just looking around.
Oh, oh, you are, you are university colleagues.
What exactly were you looking for, hmm?
Perhaps, perhaps, Dr. Chester Stock's reflections on the Smiledon Californicus?
uh
Ah Ah get out of here! Uh, meet someone? Or-or are you just here to revisit Marion's perspective on evolution?
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far too progressive.
I find Marion's views far too progressive.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm a teacher here, Ross Geller.
Ross Geller, why do I know this name? It's uh-Wait! Have you written this?
Yes! Are you the person who checked my book ?!
You see, you do not look like I thought. You are so young.
Well, I skipped the note.

You did not have the right to tell me that you already had feelings for me.
What?
I was doing well with Julie before discovering your identity.
Hey, I was doing well before I knew about you. Do you think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
The fact is that I ...
I do not need that now, okay.
It's too late, I'm with someone else, I'm happy.
This ship sailed.
Okay, okay, go ahead and do it, okay Ross.
Well.
Because I do not need your stupid ship.
Well.
Well.

Oh, it's so romantic to send people on honeymoon.
You know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel have a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Just now my love.
See you later.
Oh shoot!
I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later.
I do not have a key, they took mine to give it to you.
What?! They took mine to give you!
Why would they take our keys?
Wow! It seems like we have a lot of good things.
Oh yes, but my mother gave us the most beautiful gifts.
A
No, she's going to live with us for eight weeks.
Uh what?
Yes! She will help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
What are you not serious about?
I mean, she's a very nice woman, but there's no way to take her eight weeks.
She will make us totally crazy.
Hi Ross!
Hi roommate!

Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I do not know!
It's not like it's porn!
It is a serious and legitimate film.
You know?
And nudity is really important for history.
That's what you say about porn.
You are right. Maybe I should not even answer the call.
No! No you should! Many major actors make nude scenes! I mean, the chance to play in a movie? Come on!
Well, that's right.
And I'm naked only in a scene.
In addition, it sounds really good.
My character is Catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
Who flee together and get caught in this big storm of rain.
So we go in this barn, we undress and we stand.
It's really nice and tender.

Hey whats up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But are you still moving in together, right? Because my ad has been released today.
"Wanted, roommate, non-smoker, not ugly." Pleasant!
Yeah?
I just thought, after living with you, it would be a nice change of pace to have a roommate, you know?
I can learn from someone, someone different from me.
And what's more different than me; a guy who is

So where are we going next?
This witness will not return my calls, so we'll see if we can surprise him on his way home.
Surprise him? We are not, we will not make anyone crazy, are we?
Go dude! Listen, then, are you going to squeeze the Perps shoes a bit before he gets up?
It's a witness, not a perp. And nobody speaks like that!
Yes, nobody speaks like that!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey, I'm more of a cop than you two!
How do you count that?
Hi! I'm up front, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
I suppose.
Here you are. Thank you!
Wait, Rachel! Where is the other?
Oh what, do you want both?
Rachel Karen Green, where is the other earring ?!
Okay, okay, listen, do not panic, but I lost it a bit.
I know it's in the apartment, but I
What am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell him to wear his own earrings.
These
Nooo! Nooooo! Did you lend me Monica's earrings ?! I do not have the right to borrow his stuff!
Why not?
Because I'm losing business!

Well, you sweat.
These are pearls of joy.
Oh that's nice. Do not touch me.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Yeah!
What is going on?
Chandler is still gone!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide-and-seek with someone you know to be at risk of stealing ?!

Okay. Are you ready to push again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Ok, ok, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Yeah!!
Little Leslie is here!
We have another one!
Oh my God, I can not believe I have two or two children.
How is this scary?
Come on, little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
Okay, he's coming. He is coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler is a girl!
Oh my God, kindergarten flashback.
They must read the sonogram badly.
Because they thought it was a boy, but Chandler is a girl!
Chandler is a girl!
Ok, keep telling it!
Am I too late ?!
No-no ah, everything is fine. Everyone is healthy, there are 30 fingers and 30 toes.
We have our babies?
Yeah.
Oh, we have our babies.

Hi Toby!
Hi Bobby.
It's Bob actually. Hey, you work here, can you tell me where this Chandler
Uhh yeah. Yeah, that's right, just downstairs. Right there, yes. May I ask you why?
I want to talk to this bastard, see what is his problem.
Ok, Bob, listen, I'm the reason you did not get the job here.
Toby no.
Bob!
Toby! I will not let you cover it. Everything you say now will make me even more angry with Chandler!
Ohh!
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this cradle! This is so cute!
I know! I found it on the street.
Are you serious-really ?! It's in such good shape.
Yeah.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
I do not know.
It moves.
Ew.
It's always - he has a tail! Get out of here! Get out of here !!
Ooh! Ah! Okay!

Well, I went to Kyle's last night to take some things and we had to remember
we chatted almost all night and realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there were still feelings. So
Oh, just tell him Kyle!
We will do another try.
What about her groans and constant need for attention ?!
I will work there.
Oh yes, because you are so capable of change.
You know, he buzzes when he pee!
I know.
It makes him miss the bowl, but it does not matter.
We are really sorry.
It does not matter, we do not need you. In fact, hey, I'm already above.
Yes, and you know what? I do not give the ass of a tiny rat.
Yes, we will go there.
I am sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were right, you were right for her. You know, she
Oh. You know, he's buzzing while he's doing other things.
Yes, we are better without them.
And you know, even if they separate, you better not leave it in your sad club!
Club of divorced men.
Potato, Potaato.

Why did not this valet come back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you have the keys?
Porsche.
It's totally your fault!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you tore the paper from the court reporter's machine !!
Can we, can we just forget that this has already happened?
Yes of course, absolutely! You are right. I am sorry.
Thank you.
Yes.
Okay, I guess I'll go packing.
Okay. Oh, wait! One more thing, do we still have to settle the question of "us?"

Phoebe!
Yeah?
Did you see Chandler ?!
No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said there was a cancellation and we could ride our wedding and Chandler heard!
I know!
How is it serious?
!
Well for the average guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh my God!
I know! I know! And he totally panicked and I can not find him anywhere!
What are you going to do?
Well, I'll never listen to you again, that's for sure!
"You know, can evil do if you put your name?
Rachel said that!
Well, Rachel is not here!

Come on.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
It's all your fault.
It's supposed to be, like, the biggest day of my life, you see?
My son is being born and I should be there, you know, instead of being stuck in a closet with you.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I expected that as much as you.
No no no, believe me.
Nobody expects that as much as me, okay?
And you know what's funny?
When this day is over, you'll go home with the baby, okay?
Where does this leave me?
You become the father of the baby.
Everyone knows who you are.
Who am I?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no ... lesbian party.
Every day is the day of lesbian love.
It's awesome.
Do you want to explain that?
I mean, well, because when I was growing up, you know my dad left, my mother died and my stepfather went to jail, so I just had enough pieces of parents to to make an integer.
And here is this little baby who has about three parents who care about it so much that they argue over who will love him the most.
And it's not even born yet.
That's right, it's just the luckiest baby in the world.
I'm sorry, you fought.

Ok, it's a typical apartment in New York City. Two girls are just hanging around.
Hi, how are you Kelly?
I am doing very well! My God, Tiffany, you feel so good!
It's my new perfume. Why do not you come closer where you can
Oh, you know Joey, you're sick!
It's disgusting!
I do not read this!
What?! Wait wait! The handsome man was about to enter !!

Okay, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
I mean he has the monocle, he has the top hat ...
Do you know he's gay?
I just want to clarify this: Are you leaving Mr. Peanut?
Danielle! Hi! Everyone is Danielle, Danielle, everyone.
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
So what
What?
What is it?
That she left you?
What does she like about women?
That she left you for another woman who loves women?
A little stronger, I think there is a man on the 12th floor in a coma who did not hear you well ...
So what?
My first time with Carol was ...
What?
It was my
With Carol? Oh.
So in all your life, you've only been with one - oh.
Whoah, my boy, hockey was a big mistake! We could have done a lot of things tonight!

Hi. Where is everyone?
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up - what's wrong?
My wedding, I think my wedding is uh, is a little over.
Oh no! Why?
Because Carol is a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently, it's not a mixed situation.
Oh my God! I do not believe it! Oh, poor bunny.
I am an idiot.
I mean I should see it, I mean Carol and I would be out and she would see it, she would see a beautiful woman and, and she would be Ross you know, look at her and I would think, God, my wife is cool!
Aw! Hey, do you think this Susan person is her lover?
Well, now I'm doing it !!
I am sorry.
Seven years.
I mean we have been together for seven years. She is the only woman to love me, and the only woman to have ...
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
I will do it.
No you will not do it.
Listen, he knows he's done something terrible and I think he's sorry.
But, you still have an excuse to make, okay, you have to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Ok, absolutely!
Okay.
You have it.
Cookie, now you can hit it!
What?!

Okay, that's all, I stopped.
What? I said nothing.
Yes, but it's not the face of a person who trusts a person.
Ok, it's the face of a person who, you know, does not trust a person.
I am sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than we had discussed.
Do you want to relax? I know what I'm doing. That's how he wears it.
Julie
What?!
Jody!
You were with Julie?
Look, when it started, I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.
And then one thing drove another and, before I knew it, we ... were shopping.
Oh. Oh my God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It did not mean anything to me.
Yes indeed. Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking about you all the time.
Listen, I'm sorry, okay.
I never wanted you to find out!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
This is not true!
Oh, so you sort of managed to leave it here?
Have you ever thought I could be so stupid?
Ok monica I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to

Hey!
Yeah!
I can not tell.
Why?!
Why not?
I can not say because he is famous.
Oh my God, who is it ?!
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
OK OK. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
As in Barbara Streisand's husband, James Brolin?
What?! Well, he never told me that!

In
Oh, this life! Oh ok no, Chandler is worse.
Dude, it must be so cool to remember things like that! I have no memory of past life.
Of course you do not do it darling. You are new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, do not tell this story.
Oh, come on!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey has Monica's turkey stuck to the head!
What?! Joey has a turkey stuck to the head ?!
Hey, it's not like it's ringing.
His

Wendy, we had an agreement! Yes, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was it?
Wendy bailed. I do not have a waitress.
Too bad. Bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon I wish I could, but I planned to walk.
You know, Rachel, when you missed your wedding, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if it does not tell you anything ... twenty dollars an hour.
Completed.

The reactor will explode in three seconds, we will never get there!
You have to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I will not leave you!
Do not worry about me, I'm a robot! I am only a machine !!
No you are not! Not for me!
Oh my God.
What?
I am
Yeah, you're great! Ok, let's take that
No, I mean I was really playing the ass.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh yes, you are solid. Yes, you're just not me.
You know what? I think that's enough for the moment. Yeah. I do not want to be repeated too much.
Well!
I will do it without you!
I do not need you or anyone else!
I will do it myself!
You will see!!
you will

I can not believe that Ross is gone. It's so sad.
I did not know Ross and you were so close.
We were not but we had a class together. He was a great guy and he spoke so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
And if the sky has a door, I'm sure he's hugging her ear and listening carefully.
I thought so much about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
But you did not do it!
I am still alive!!
Kori, I know it's a big surprise for you.
It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day!
I mean, the fact that you're here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
You're sick monster, who does that? I can not believe I have a crush on you!
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me !!

We will do a quick check.
Okay.
So eight days late huh?
Yeah.
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Hey, just a little bit.
You are cleared at about 80%, so you are on your way.
It could still last a little longer.
If you are worried, there are many ways to help things.
Make them !!
In fact, these are things you can do. Some home remedies, but in my experience, I have found that some of them are very effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Ok, there is an herbal tea that you can drink.
Okay.
What's wrong with Emma?
Oh, she misunderstood, she was thinking of moving to Tulsa.

Whenever you are ready.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Ok, where am I talking here?
I mean, uh, well, there's a way that seems to offer some acoustic benefit, but ...
Just aim at the hump.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, that's it.
You know, I, you know, I can not do that.
Uh, that's so weird.
I feel stupid.
So do not do it, it's good. You do not have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hi baby. Hello Hello.

Hi!
Oh hi. It's Mark.
Oh.
What? Is it my breath?
Ow!
Rachel?
Ow! Ow!
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Ok, I do it.
Okay.
I really do.
Okay, I'll get your coat and then I'll put you in a taxi.
Okay. Oh, wait, wait, are not you coming with me?
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Okay.
Okay?
Thank you. Oww !!!! God!
What?! What's wrong?
I'm sorry, I just can not go to the hospital with that appearance.

Pete Becker is spinning around the ring now. It looks like he's just trying to feel it. Oh, Bruiser is just ...
Run! Run crazy, rich monster!
Oh, I can not watch that.
Look, he wins! Pete wins!
Really?!
No-o-o !!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the web and is heading to his favorite area.
Oh! Oh!
Wait, if that's his favorite field, why is he so mean?
Well, it's ironic.
Among your last two friends, Richard did not want to have children, and as it seems, Pete can not anymore.
Dude, you do not have to boast! We have nothing here !!

Should we tell Rachel that there is an empty private room right next to hers?
We can or can have sex in it.
Well, let me think about it while I take off my pants!
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you would go out with him.
Oh! Oh, I think I'm going to throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.
What?!
What? I told myself that since you were pregnant, you will not see people.
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not a people. Secondly, what did he say when you told him that I was pregnant?
I did not tell her. I did not know if you told people. That's when I thought Kash was still a person.
Well, well, do not tell him. Do not tell him. Ask him to call me in agreement?
Look Rach, I really do not think it's such a good
Ok, you'll do it! I will come back to this set! I will meet more actors! I will meet them all!

Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua left then Emily and you are free to leave.
Its good.
She's still here to take advantage of her fake party and uh, it's too late to do what I expected, so
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, wait, wait, wait
You tell them to wait!
Okay. Expect! Expect!
Emilie.
Oh no-no-no! Oh no! No! No! Emily!

Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Okay.
I know. You are the guy who would not want to participate in the do-it-yourselfer.
It does not matter!
No, I actually thought it was unfair in the way everyone reacted. I mean, you just moved in.
I
Jen
Jen, I know it may sound a little bit But uh, maybe you want to have a coffee someday
Sure! It would be good.
Umm?
Oh! My number is there. Call me.
I called you.
I will see you later.
Okay!
I forgot my paper.

Here we go. Ok, get ready.
What?
Okay.
Ow!
Are not you going to go?
No thanks.
No, Rachel never pee in public toilets.
Well, they never have paper in you know. So, my rule is "no fabric, no stoned". If everyone goes there.
No, you know what does not close because the ... keys ... are in it.
Oh no no no no no no no!
What is going on?
My lighter is in it!
I promise.
Although, do not feel like you can not visit.
Hey, is Chandler here?
No, no he is not.
Joey, you just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What? So what are you going to do? I mean, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I thought about that and I think the best way would be not to do it.
Joey, you can not keep this for yourself, if you know, you have to tell him.
It'll kill him. I mean it's okay, it's just going to kill him.
Well, you can wait until I go to the dentist, maybe

Hi!
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, ah ah, I was just wondering, when you and I separated, did you have the tape that was half of the last episode of
Oh yes, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Where is Ben?
He is sleeping.
Ahh Ooh, it's an ah, it's a bad time?
Uh, yeah, actually, Susan is going home in a moment, it's a bit of a birthday.
Oh! I thought you were married in January?
It's not that kind of birthday.
Ah! Oh.
Sooo !! Anyway...
Where are we going to find a little hat?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll get "Rainy Day Bear" !!
Because he will know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
Oh my god, oh my god, it's sown.
Give the. Give the.
Okay.
Oh!!
Oh, it's like a bloodbath here today.

Please. It's so much your fault.
How, how is it my fault?
Listen, Carol never threw me out of a room before you arrived.
Yeah? There are many things that Carol never did before I arrived.
Are you trying to be smart? A funny lady?
Do you know what is your problem? You are threatened by me.
Oh, am I threatened by you?
Yes.
Hey, hey, all right, all right!
Come in here.
Come on.
God, I do not believe you.
There are children who come into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should hear.
So stop screaming, stop!
Yes, Susan.
Do not force me to do it again, I do not like my voice like that.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?

Oh! It's here! Ooh Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I did not do this! Who would have done that ?!
Son of a bitch!
Ok, maybe ask this guy.
Oh, did not I mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin in a medical research project.
You know that sometimes good ideas are right in front of you, do not you?
Ok, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. You know? The only problem is, Carl's role is
the
Yes, it's the reason why I did not have this big
Hey, can I have a little piece of this cake?
Pizza!! We love pizza !! Get out !!!

Hey Monica, there is a customer who wants to complete the chef, should I let him in?
Of course, I love this part!
Enter.
Really? Right now, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment, yes.
But only in the moment. So you still want to kiss?
Of course, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.
Neither do I.
3, 2,
Joey, you do not have to count every time you kiss.
Uh, okay. Except that I felt like I needed a few seconds to get ready.

Wow Wow!
Yeah.
Well. Phoebe?
OK OK.
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would like, um, peace in the world, more hunger, good things for the rainforest ... And bigger breasts!
Yeah, you see .. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I would be omnipotent forever.
You see, there is always a guy. "If I had a wish, I would like to make three more wishes."
Hi Joey. Hi. Hey buddy.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill me!
..Excuse me?
Hey, if little Joey is dead, then I have no reason to live!
Joey, uh-
You

I am sorry.
Joey, on stage!
Can you at least stay until the end of the room?
I mean, I'll go to the airport with you, I-I mean bye.
Where are you Vic?
The flight is in an hour. I-I have to go.
Vic! Vic!
In a minute!!
So that's it? Victor?
Yes, I guess it is.
Look, I have to say goodbye, and I have to say quickly because it kills me.
One thing you should know is that I will never forget you.
But you have things to do now, and me too.
And so I'm going up on this spaceship, and I'm going to go to Blargon 7 looking for alternative fuels.
But when I come back, in 200 years, you'll be gone a long time ago.
But I will not have aged at all.
So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look at me, because Adrienne, baby, I'm going to want to meet her.
See you soon, Vic!

I must say
Nooo Way! The most romantic song is ever
See, I-I think the one that Elton John wrote for, uh, this guy on
What song was it, Pheebs?
Hi Monica!
Hey Mon!
Hey Mon!
Oh my God, did she sleep?
Nope.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Yes, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts on the terrace, then.
Oh, ok, that explains that.
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, for example, that high-pitched, squeaky sound, so I said okay, it's like a mouse or an opossum.
But then, I realized where a mouse or an opossum would have the money to make the phone call.

So, man, are you going to play with me tonight?
You know what, I do not know how much I'm going to see how hot sex is between a guy and your girlfriend.
yes I know but
Oh no-no-no, I'm here.
Hey!
Hey Mon! Do you want pancakes?
You made pancakes?
Yes! Take a plate.
Okay.
No, no, stay there. To get closer.
Okay, okay, but do not worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,
Look, too, we are watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come.
Oh yes!

Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yes, sandwiches to the hero.
Well, you all know that I am a pacifist and that the war does not interest me at all.
But what do you know?
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.
Not you Joey.

Oh my goodness
Hey! Continue counting down your favorite dishes. Tonight, # 3, cheese macaroni with cut hot dogs.
Look, you've done enough! Okay? You must stop this now.
I go! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to the tape you made for me.
Oh, the mixed band.
Your appearance tonight
You are just the sweetest.
No! You are the sweetest!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
What?
I check the restaurant with Pete.
Oh, Monica, I'm so excited for you.
Wait wait! Expect!!

So, darling, this three-um thing, I mean, how are you going to start finding
Ooh, actually, I made a list of all the women I know who could be involved in this task!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone did their homework.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know that Gail Rosten is there twice, but she's so
Oh, I know. You know, just just talking about it, it becomes a little
Oh me too.

and then, we could have gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Ross, that just would not have been feasible.
But having a ring on your finger would not have been a problem?
It was really fun to be married to you tonight.
Yeah! And! And it was the easiest 400 dollars I ever earned.
Ok Ross, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
This proposal, at the planetarium
I know, I know it was stupid.
Are you kidding?!
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!
It was really wonderful!
Have you just done that?
No, actually I thought about it when, when we went out.
That's how I imagined, I would ask you to marry me.
Well, it would have been very difficult to say no, too.
It's a good thing I did not do it because it seems like it would have been a very expensive wedding. OK good night
Good night
Even if the sidecar had a windshield so your hair would not be damaged?
I will think about it.
That's all I ask

Guys! It was bananas, cream and beef! I-I can not believe you've eaten that so I do not feel bad!
In fact, I did not eat mine. It's always in the bathroom.
No it is not, I ate that.
We left ours in Monica's room.
No, I understand and I have yours too.

Okay, so we went to the beach because Phoebe discovered this lady who knew her parents, and I do not really know what happened.
And I'm so happy that there is no problem.
In fact, I am a member of the hiring committee. There will be at least one friendly face.
Ohh! It's awesome!
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the
Really?!
No-ho-ho!
Yeah.
I mean, no-no-no-no, do not worry, I do not doubt that your qualifications will require you to sleep with a guy to get this job.
Although I may need to convince.
Well, I
Joke! God, I feel wild today!

Oh my God! Chandler has just left!
Yes, but maybe that's not what we think. Maybe it's telling Monica that I'm sorry I drank the last milk.
Or maybe he was writing to tell him that he had changed his name, you see? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I think that means he panicked and left!
Do not be so negative! Good God! Is not it possible that Sorry is sitting right now ?!
Okay. Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we going to do?
Listen Ok, I'm just going to have to go get him and bring him back!
Okay?
Make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Okay.
Okay
I will find it.

Hey!
Hi! Hey!
Do you know cute guys?
Yes of course! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh I am sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table so I have to go a little bit
What is charity?
I do not know, something about trees or disease, Ralph mumbles a lot.
Ralph mumbles when you're not careful?
Yeah! It's strange. But the thing is the need to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Hey!
What are you guys doing later?
Oh, Rachel and I have an appointment to get our hair cut.
We do?
I want to see what he wants first.
Okay.
I just discovered that Elizabeth's father wants to meet me.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's father ?!
Come on guys, I really want this guy to love me.
It would really help if you were there to make me look good.
Of course, we will help you! Yeah! We will be there!
Thank you!
We know how difficult these parent-teacher conferences can be.

Oh hi! How are you?
I'm fine. I have to go down to the police station and watch the rants.
Oh.
Thank you for inviting me, guys.
Label?
Are you going?
Uh we did not have, uh we did not have a chance to talk.
Uh, so where are you from?
Colorado.
Ah, what are you good at?
Listen, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay.
Ah, I-I should never have said what I said.
What do you know?
It does not matter what I feel.
I mean, we work together, so nothing could ever happen between us, and what I'd like to do is just go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about it again, okay?
Uh, I'm not.
Oh, my god, I knew it, I panicked you.
No, you did not do it The only thing that scared me was that nothing could ever happen between us.
Really?
Yeah, so please, do not shoot me for that.
Okay, well, it's one less thing we have to do Monday.

Grab it! GRAB IT! Grab it! Get-YESSS! You do not laugh, huh!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of guys without teeth who hit each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!
It is open!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, listen, we're on this thing on TV!

I'm so excited that I kept this chair for me!
Yeah me too.
Hey, how's the miracle chair?
Well.
Yeah? Wow! You know, this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Not really?
Yeah! You can connect it to your TV
My chair is healing itself.

Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study last night?
Yes! Yes I did it.
So do Iceberg!
G-sharp.
g
What?! I did not touch a guitar!
No, but you question my method!
No, I do not ask myself a question, I say it's stupid! What?!
Thank you.
You know that none of my other students thought I was stupid.
Your other pupil, it was you!
Yeah, well, you know maybe you just have to try a little harder!
Listen, I may need to try a real teacher!
Right here!
Right here!
Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and looks ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and
Well! You will learn from your qualified instructor! But do not come crying when everyone is tired of hearing you play
"The meanest man in all this damn town."
Oh good! Take his part!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey has to work. Now come!
Hey!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this feedback when all five pages are complete! Ahh!

Hi!
Hi.
Hi. Umm, I think there is something we really need to talk about.
I think we do. Why do not we go inside? Listen, I know why you're here.
You do?
Yes, and to avoid embarrassment, I think I should perhaps speak first.
Okay.
Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. It's a hell of a saw, is not it?
What?
I mean, look, that night was fun and certainly passionate, but do not you think it would be better if we stayed friends?
Seriously. What?!
Okay.
Okay.
You know what?
If you wish, we can do it once again.
I mean, I would agree with that.
In fact, I have some time now.
Ok, you know what? May I, can I speak now?
Oh, of course.
I am pregnant. Ross? Ross? Ok, every time you are ready. And you're the father by the way, but you have that

We should definitely play football more often. Maybe we could join a similar league or something.
I know!
Yes! Wow, well, it was easy. Ok, you are going.
Okay.
Okay.
Ok, you know, you know when you're in bed with a woman.
Hmph.
And, ah, you know, you're having fun with it.
And you have all those things, mental pictures in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at Xerox ....
With the navel ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, and all of a sudden, your mother falls on your head.
And your kind 'Mom, get out of here!'
You know, but of course, afterwards, you can not think of anything else, and you can not stop what you are doing.
So it's a bit like, you are, you know.
You know .... You do not know!
Your mother, your you tell me, you tell me about your mother, what's wrong with you?
You said...
I said '

Oh!
Look at Emma!
I can not decide who she looks more like, Rachel or you?
Oh, are you kidding? She is beautiful, that's all Rachel.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why are not you together yet?
No, I know.
I know, because you are not there.
Which would be nice, except that you are totally.
It's complicated, okay?
Yeah that's right. Yes, you love him. You always have. You have a child together. There is no good answer.
Look, we have been together.
Okay?
And then apart, then together, then apart, and now we have a baby.
It's just so-if we got together and it did not work I could never do that to Emma
I mean she-she thinks of everything- Oh it's me now.
What are they putting something in the water at this place?
Since Rachel and I are doing really well, we are doing really well now.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more, you could destroy it.
Yes exactly.
Right. Or you could get everything you wanted since the age of fifteen.

God. I forgot how much I like to drive. I have
You do not have
Oh Ross, you're so tense! You just have to relax, okay? Just need to relax, okay? Just need to relax
What are you doing?! Do you agree, it's not funny! Just stop walking!
I do not walk around, okay? I am Porsche.
Uh-oh.
Ok, stay calm. Nothing will happen to you, you do not have so many problems.
Really? You think?
I was talking to myself! You descend!

Hello Darling! I missed you today!
Oh yes?
Yeah. What do you want to do tonight?
Oh, well ... maybe we could ...
Ok, I try to excite myself by doing a bazaar?
Know your audience!
In addition, tomorrow we are doing these fertility tests and by then you must keep your tadpoles in the bin.
We really need to pass these tests?
Honey, we have been trying to have a baby for over a year.
I think it's a good idea to know if everything is fine. Just a few routine tests.
But I do not want to do it in a cup!
Oh, Hi Max! Hey, do you know everyone?
Did you see David?
No, no, he was not around.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Minsk?
Minsk. It's in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We had the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
So when will you go?
January 1.

You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Yes. Yes! Please, enter.
Oo-oo!
Pretty good! Except that I had a little attitude of the robot.
Damn these robots, they are supposed to be our
Anyway, it was not the robot, it was the guy who controlled it.
Yes, he does not love me.
He was C.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.
topple the sandwich just when I was looking for one!
Ohh!
Why do not you fire him?
I have to do it, I hate to do it, but I'm the star!
You know?
There is a limit to the number of sandwiches I can eat on the floor.
Excuse me.
Joey Tribbiani.
Joe! I'm happy to have found you, I have an audition for you!
Wow!
The thing is, it's a bit on Q.T.
The actor who has the role does not know he can be fired.
This is the main role of a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I am the leader in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!
Uh-oh!

Oh, God! If you want a baby so bad, go steal it!
What's going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies. I am crazy about ourselves.
What?
Look, we always talked about having babies one day.
I'm not saying it has to be now, but I'm starting to think we can deal with it.
Was good.
We are really good.

Oh, did you catch it ?!
Uh-huh.
What did he say?!
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda." Of course, I could not give him my real name?
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw how he came out of here!
What do you think?
He will stay and talk to the girl he abandoned!
What did you tell him?
Well, I said, I told him you know, that I was Francis's executor and that I had to talk to him so I could meet him at the cafe later.

Oh yes, of course.
Ok, in ten seconds you'll see him kiss me.
And in about five seconds, you'll see why.
Ross, did I ever tell you how long I went to Europe?
Ok, get ready to see some!
Oh, you came to Ross!
What?!
Now I am so happy.
What are you talking about?!
You used the history of Europe!
This is the magical story you use when you want to make love!
How do you know this story ?!
How to do
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from a guy!
A guy!!
No, she told me that her name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams !!

How are you, are you ready?
Mom has already called this morning to remind me not to comb my hair. Did you know that my ears are not my best asset?
Some days, that's all I can think of.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I could not find myself.
Oh ... all right, all right.
But euh ...
I just have a question for you, ehm ...
When we go out, should we walk, or run, or prance, or wander ...
Stop, stop! He speaks slowly but he could pee quickly! OK, let's go!!

I can not believe that! How long does it last?
Well, um, Alexandra was
Oh, that has a name?
Phoebe, do not get angry!
Ok-oop! Too late! I leave! Come on Chandler let's go!
Well, Phoebe, I thought - Yeah, but God

Ben!
Oh it's good. Maybe he will hear you and pull the cord.
Stop the bus! Expect! Expect! Expect!
Are you sure he did not break it because it really hurts?
No, it's just a good bone blue. And here is the flat wound of your ring.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry!
Hey!
Hey!
I got my s!
That we can celebrate later.
Celebrate.

Ok, Paulo, why do not you just get dressed, and then you'll be on the way, okay, goodbye.
Rachel, how did this happen?
I do not know, I just met him a little bit last night.
Or?
At home Is this juice?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dropped him because he hit Phoebe?
Oh my God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
I licked my arm, what?
It's breast milk.
So?
Phoebe is a person's squeezed juice.
What is the big problem?
What have you just done?
Ok, would people stop drinking breast milk?
You will not even taste it?
No!
Not even if you claim it's milk?
Not even if Carol's chest bore the picture of a missing child.

Aww!
Now that's funny.
Hey Pheebs, could you please do not set foot on my new old sheet?
Oh, of course! Noo!
Ohh !!
My apothecary table !!!
What?!
Noooooo !!
Ross, where did you get this ?!
I had it at
Oh my god, Phoebe,
Wow! Oh my God, well, if they snatched our table, ours must cost well over fifty dollars!
Oh yes.
It does not even smell of opium.
Of course not, it smells of the wine you have spilled! And thank you for destroying my sheet by the way.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.

How is she?
It's too early to say. She is resting, which is a good sign.
How are the hair?
I'm not going to lie to you, Ross, it does not look good.
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped curling.
Can we see it?
Your hair is too beautiful, I think it would upset her. Ross, why do not you come?
Yeah.
How are you?
Of course, the packaging appeals to adults and children.
Ross, you're stupid. I tried, it does not matter. Just taste.
It would be no.
Come on. It does not have bad taste.
Yeah, it's a little nice, kind of, uh ...
Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
Did you taste it? You have tasted it.
Uh huh
Oh, you have tasted it.
You can continue to say it, but it will not stop being true.
Give me the bottle. Give me the towel.

I still do not understand why Greg and Jenny gave us a fake number.
You know, if they knew what they were doing, they probably did not give you real names either.
Ok, maybe people give fake numbers, but they do not give false names.
Oh yes? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Regina Philange.
I still do not understand, we did not do anything wrong.
I know! Although you have told a lot of jokes.
I thought these jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Joke. Joke. BLA bla! BLA bla!
Well, maybe it was all your questions.
What about my questions?
No I am sorry. It's just that my foot itches like crazy.
Oh, I'll get it.
Wow! In general, I know a girl a little better before letting her spoon me.
Relax, we are not poking.

Look at this! Ohhh! The wallpaper is a little faded, it's good. The carpet is a little loose. Hardwood floors !!
Hey!
Hello.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It is so beautiful.
I know!!!
So, here I am, ready to play.
Okay.
I brought a lot of things for the house, so take a look at it. Ha-ha.
What is this?
It's a dog, every house should have one.
Not the one who can piss on the roof.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built with radioactive waste.
And is it in case the house sneezes?
No, no, it's the ghost of the attic.
I do not want a ghost.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you have one, because the house is located on an old Indian cemetery.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an old Indian cemetery? It would never happen.
Okay, of course, you know little about the US government.
Hey!
Hello.
I need to talk to you!
Of course, what's up?

Okay, I just changed in thirty seconds so you could be alone with him. You better go.
Please, I'm not going for nothing.
Well, if you do not do it, I'll do it.
Would you please go?
I would like!
Hey, guys, did you see my new bathroom ?!
Uh-huh.
Look look.
Ooohhhh !!
And and!
Ahhhh !!
Hey, my dad's house does that!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
The movie was great, the dinner was great and nothing beats a cool, cool evening in New York.
Hmm.
Of course, I could not take advantage of all that, because Joanna is such a

Okay. It's Emma
Emma! See? I do not want it.
Take it.
What?
It's clearly an Emma.
Oh honey, but you like that name.
Yes, but I love you more.
Besides, you know, nothing's wrong with Bing.
So I'm screwed.
I mean Oh, hi Emma.
Yes it's you.
You are our little Em.
Oh what's this darling?
What?
Oh, do you want a little cousin?
Do you want a cousin now?
!

Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I'm going, "Quack, quack!" I am happy all the time!
Good try.
Wait wait!
Look, Monica
Look!
It will not work.
I bet it'll work!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can not believe that!
No I do not have!
Yes you can!
No I do not have!
You love Me!
No, I do not do! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that!

Hello Greg?
Hi, is Monica from the plane?
Listen, the number you gave me 853-5 This is their old number!
Jenny gives it since they moved!
Jenny! It's so Jenny!
Hey, listen, how would you like to meet?
Say next Saturday?
Ok, why not Sunday?
Ok, uh, the week after?
The week after that?
What do you know Greg?
You know what?
We are good, interesting, funny people with

Hey Chandler! You know, that girl you went to college with, who became a director?
Oh yes, Dana Keystone. She was in my movement class.
What is a movement class?
This is Chandler's way of pretending he did not take a mime.
Oh, listen, she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You must pass me an audition!
Oh, I do not know, man. I have not spoken to him for ten years.
I am.
Joey, what are you talking about? You are a great actor.
Do you really think that?
Ugh, how can you even ask this question ?!

Ross! Get a shot of this. (He wears a number from
Oh, all right, I have another one!
This one does not hurt either-Ooh, yes it does!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ooh!
Oh, I was hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Okay. Hey, but it'll make me really good. Oh, and something else, the video camera? Pleasant!!

Yes I love you. Okay goodbye! Hi!
Hi!
It was Alice's mother, she said she left since five o'clock. She should be here now!
Oh, honey, do not worry. She will arrive on time.
Yeah.
I guess I set up the video camera to try to attract Joey.
But unfortunately, I could not be attracted.
Unbelievable! I mean, did you really keep Joey's underwear ?! Why? Why would you do that ?!
I am Monica. I am disgusting. I track down guys and keep their underwear.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who is disgusting and who is not.
Huh?
Well, now, I'm going back to my bucket.
I'm just eating the skin, so the chicken is up for grabs.

I did not find anything at Joey's place - Hey, hey!
Oh, all right, they gave you the prices of the old days.
Yeah.
Well, what period is it?
Uh, that's old. As in the old days. You know?
Yes yes I
My God, oh it's just perfect!
Wow!
I bet there is also a nice story behind her.
Did they tell you anything?
As you know where it came from or
Yes! I know it comes from White Plains.
White plains. Oh, it sounds like a magical place.

So you still do not think I'm a friend?
Huh?
I saw you watching me during the match last night.
I, shut up!
Goodbye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your mother lives in Montauk. You just wrote that!
Well, that's pretty much the point. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Noooo !!
Okay, hang in there!

Rachel, it'll happen. Chandler will move in here.
But I
No-no, wait!
Let me just finish, okay?
It's not something we just did, we just decided impulsively in Vegas, it's something we both want.
And that
It is? Really?
Yes my darling.
I mean we are not, we will not live together anymore?
No.
What? Oh my God! I will miss you so much!
I'll miss you!
I mean, it's the end of an era!
I know!

Why do all coffee mugs have numbers at the bottom?
Oh. That's why Monica can keep track. So, if one of them is missing, she can say, "Where is the number 27 ?!"
You know what?
It does not have.
Ok, so what you had with Rachel is what I have with Alice.
Now, what is it?
It's so cool, man, it's just because being with her is so much better than not being with her.
Yeah yeah.
Why do not I find that?
Do not ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Well, I want it!
You can have it!
I do not know, maybe I can not. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
Oh no! No!
It's outside the man! I saw it! J? have understood !!
So you hold it !!
Okay, man !!
Okay, congratulations, lucky bastard!

Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
Push!
Push them, push them, stronger, stronger.
Push them, push them back, get out!
Let's get this ball and move really, hey, hey, ho, ho.
I was just-yeah, that's right.
Push!
Push!

Okay.
Ross, did not you say there was an elevator here?
Uh, yes I did it but there is none. Ok, here we go.
Ok, go left. Left! Left!
Ok, you know what? There is no more left, left!
Oh ok, lift it over your head!
Right over your head!
You can do it!
You can do it!
Okay.
You got it?
Oh, ok, I understand.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just that I never even
Howard is the
Yes but also me he is right, man.
Ok, ok, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ugh, can you believe this guy!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.

Ohh!
What?
He launched! I think the baby hit!
Oh my God!
Oh no, wait, oh no, the elastic of my underwear broke.
Oh my God! I slept too much! I had to be on the set half an hour ago! I have to get out of here!
Oh, wait, Joey, you can not go that way! You stink!
Listen, I know I fell asleep before I could shower and now I do not have time!
They are only ten blocks away, if I run, I can get there.
You arrive in the whole room! I am Chandler.
Hi.
Hi.
It bothers you if I
No, I beg you.
So, what are you going to do?
I speak in my sleep.
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
So, why do not you give me your number?

Previously in Friends.
I do not know exactly. It's a bit like the fight.
Oh?!
Yes, but without the costumes.
Oh.
And that's not wrong, it's totally brutal.
Yes, there are two guys in a ring, and the rules are: 'They are
So you can love, bite and pull people's hair?
Yeah, everything goes, except ah, fishing for the eyes and fishing for fish.
What is fish fishing?
Uh, what catches the fish ... Thanks man, it would have been really hard to describe. What is this taste?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave a duck bath.

Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lips to keep from shouting your name.
It makes me feel so good.
It was so clumsy and bumpy.
Bumpy?
Well, maybe he had some kind of cool new style that you do not know well.
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Well, there was really not much time to get used to it, do you know what I mean?

Come across! Oh! Come across! Oh! Hi! Hi! No! Right! Come across!
Oh, it's not that bad.
Yes, most damage is rather contained in the bedrooms.
Oh!
My God!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Excuse me?
Joey! He works! You would look
Oh, how?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing that is not burned is a donkey. What I do
How's your room Rach?
Everything is in ruins. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Is not it mine?
Well! My condolences!
So uh, you can not live here for a while, you have a place to stay, ladies?
Wow! Oh ok, look buddy, I'm
Yes, they can stay with us.
Did you understand what triggered Mr. Fireman's fire?
There is so much pressure.
I mean no offense, but what you do is very different.
I do not know if you understand.
Yes, none of us have to deal with job pressures.

Phoebe, you have to do something!
Well, you know.
I mean, it's impossible for Joey to succeed in time.
So I will go through the hotel and see if there are other weddings going on.
Okay. Oh, but do not tell them Monica is pregnant because she frowns.
Okay.
Okay.

What's all about you fighting ?! Is it really over a room ?! I mean, it's so stupid!
Ross, we can handle that.
Apparently no, and I can not stand there and watch two people who matter to me being very hurt for something so stupid.
I mean, enough of foolishness!
Well, why do not you tell him to stop being stupid!
OK OK!
Two very good points, look, I have known you both for a long time and I have never seen you or a millionth of people as happy as you have been since you were together.
Do you really want to throw everything in a room?
It's so stupid.
Now what is more important, love or stupidity?
Well, we love foolishness, but we also have a weakness for love.
Love is the best medicine.
It's laughter.
Why are you doing this?
I do not know.
Okay! Okay! Chandler, you want to live with Monica, do not you?
Yes I do.
And Mon, you want to live with Chandler, do not you?
Yes.
Well! A verbal contract is mandatory in the state of New York!

Oh.
But I do not Phoebe Me.
Well, I'm not at all surprised that this is the case.
You are not? You see, that's why you're so great!
In fact, it's, it's quite, you know, a typical behavior when you have that kind of dysfunctional group dynamics.
You know, that kind of co-addict, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid cafe with your stupid big cups that, I'm sorry, might just as well have had nipples on, and you're just like me!
Defined me!
Love me, I need love!
.

Have you really done this before?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
You just take a big, big swing.
Now, do not hold back.
and Phoebe takes a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing when Chandler and Monica enter.)
Hey!
Hey hey!
What are you doing?
We are just celebrating that Joey has regained his health insurance.
Ah. Very good.
Yeah! Sure! Yes! Oh, you know what? If I heard a shot now, I would throw you my body.
Oh yes? Well, maybe you and I should walk in a poor neighborhood.
Okay!
Okay.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Cut it out Ross! I hate to save your life and kick your ass the same day!

Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yeah.
Listen, I would prefer you do not call me Joey.
Since I do not know anyone here, I thought it would be cool to try a cool job nickname.
Hey, dragon! Here are your tips for Monday and Tuesday.
There are like-there are like 300 dollars in this one!
Yes, people get pretty generous during the holidays. And it's never bad to wear tight pants.
Okay.
Could the waiters get together to hear tonight's specials?
Okay, first there is a Chilean bar made with a taste of mango on a bag.
Because we can remember it.
Because you're going to invent fake specials and cook them like you did the other night?

Hey. When you were kids and you played
I have always been Joanne.
Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighborhood?
Ewww! Oh! It's the king of mattresses!
Booo !!
Do not look darling. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Expect! Expect! I want to see that. After my divorce, half of this kingdom will be mine.
What a wank!
Oh, I can not believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
I know!
And ninety-nine years for a set of top-cushion sheets, who cares about divorce, these babies will sell themselves.
And I am dismayed for you by the fact.

You had to do it, did not you? You can not just leave that alone.
Four percent. Okay. I give more than tips when there is an insect in my food.
Ross, tonight it was pretty much that you got along well. Oh, would you already like to see my chiropractor?
Yes, I will go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
I'm panicking!
Monica trusted me in something and she should not have!
Okay, I have not lived here for a while, so I have to ask you something.
Does Monica always light the lights in her room?
Hum Yeah.
I am
Ok, listen, here's the final result, Ross, it's repairable, if we act quickly, okay.
So, I'll invite him to tomorrow's brunch and you can prepare a good meal.
Look, darling, I tried to do good, it does not work.
Ok, listen, Ross, I realize that my father is difficult, but that's why you have to be the tallest man here.
Look at my sweetheart, I could be the greatest of men, I could be the greatest of men, I could be a tall, huge giant man, and that would still make no difference, except that I could take your father and tell him me!
Like me, little doctor!
Ok, can not you try it again, Ross? For me? For me?
Rachel a brunch will not solve anything. You have to face it, all right, we will never get along.
Ok, well, you'll get some too, okay.
Because I already have a mother and father who can not stay in the same room together, all right, I do not want to have a separate room for you too!
!
Okay, okay, okay. I'm going to get the bagels.

Ok now Joey, you know that since you report all this after the audition, you will have to wear underwear?
Okay, so you better show me some of it too.
Ok, something is missing. Ooh, I know! Uh, okay.
Really? A handbag?
This is not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's handbag.
No Joey, listen. Believe me, all men wear them in the spring catalog. Look. Look see,
Look see,
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.
No! No Joey! Unisex.
Well, I'm not going to say no to that.

So, did you tell your parents?
No, but it's okay, they're pretty cool, so my brother is straight. . .
Here you are.
You know what, I just have another question, uh, if you had understood that earlier and uh, I had been around, do you think I would have been?
.
.
no, uh, I'm sorry, do not tell me, I do not think any of these answers would make me feel better.
I love you Phoebe.
So your brother is all right huh? Seriously.

Hey!
Hi.
I just came to do nothing. So this weekend, it's a bit bad, huh?
Yes, it did.
So, I guess it's over.
What?
Well, you know, you and me, it had to end one day.
Why exactly?
Because of the weekend, we quarreled.
Chandler is crazy!
If you give up every time you argue with someone, you'll never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
So, it's not over?
You're too cute!
No.
No, it was a fight.
You take care of it and move on!
There is nothing to panic about.
Really? Okay. Awesome!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We are a couple?
I'm pretty scared
Okay.

Hi!
So, you like better short hair.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Can I tell you a little secret?
Yeah!
I want to keep one.
Oh, I'll be on the news!

Oh, please.
What? Honey.
Oh, yes, my side still hurts since you crushed me yesterday.
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I know.
Ow !!
Oh my God!
Hey guys! Guess what?
Do you have a job on a river boat?
You know that I have not been wearing this costume for a year because you hated it. Well guess what? You're not my girlfriend then ...
Oh I see, so this costume makes a point.
Right.
Now that you are free, you are free to appear as stupid as you wish.
Do you like that?
Oh absolutely. I love him even more for you than for Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I am kidding!
Yeah, come here!
What were you going to tell us?
Yeah. Oh! How did you invent cotton gin ?!
Okay goodbye!

Hey, I have one! I have one!
Hi!
Hi.
Oh uh, up or down?
Oh, please, please. I hate to be a drummer, can I?
Could you please support as well?
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Oh yes? How was yours?
Well, it's a long story.
It is a bit embarrassing.
Let's just say that there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
And you?
Car accident.
Oh.
Oh, let me guess that an idiot on a cell phone was not paying attention?
Yeah. Me. Oh hey, it's me. Hey, I guess you just visited someone.
Yeah yeah.
Well, uh, if you have one day and maybe you want to visit someone else
Oh yes! I-I would like that.
I'm in the middle
Expect! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Uh, you have to press the button.

Oh, we did it and you still have all your lamps.
Oh, I did not take into account the tourist tax.
Oh man, do not worry about that, I found a maid's car unattended. We are way ahead of the game.
Oh my God.
What?
There is something new in the bowl.
Look, we've got enough, we're leaving.
No, but I want ... I want pine cones!
There is a forest just outside.
It's not the same thing.
Ok, go quickly!
Thank you for this pleasant stay.
Oh, my maple candy!

Oh my God, what happened?
Oh. My god, crazy Chandler. He spun me ... off ... of ... bed!
Wow! Running it sounds funny.
Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's hug and roll.
Ross is what?
You know what, where he kisses you and takes you off a bit and ... Oh ... my ... my God.

Oops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! It's my father, it's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting very dashing.
Go easy - if you want, there are cookies on the counter, or - or - sangria! I can do sangria!
No, no, sorry. The cookies are good, thank you.
Oh.
Well, then, uh, anyway, uh, I was looking for my dad, and uh, did you hear from him or did you see him?
Oh no, I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everyone after high school.
Oh ok. So tell me everything about my parents. All.
Ohh well. You know, we were always together, in fact, they had a nickname for us three.
Oh what? what was that?
The three losers.
Oh, poor Lily.
Ohh, you know, I heard about what happened, it must have been terrible for you, to lose your mother that way.
Yeah, no, it was great.

Okay, we've already tried to feed her, change her, beat her, oh, try this one!
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Well, it's something that says to try to hold the baby close to your body and then rotate it quickly from one side to the other.
Okay.
It worked!
Oh oh no just stopped throwing up a bit.
Oh come on, what am I going to do, it's been hours and it keeps crying.
Uh, she Rachel, not her.
Yes, I'm not so sure.
Oh my god, I'm losing my mind.
Yeah, no kidding, it proves that nothing can be good to have sex with Ross!

Well, you are not.
Oh, it's so easy for you, I mean, you're not married, you can sleep with whoever you want!
Yeah I can! And do not think I do not, because I do it! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Monica Have you, did you do it right?
Of course I have! What do you think, I am a virgin at 30?
Oh my God! You are a virgin of 30 years!
Say it louder, I do not think the guy quite at the back has heard you!
It's not like I have no opportunity.
I mean, you know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
I see this guy Roger, okay?
It's not perfect, but I think maybe I should finish it.
You know, give him my flower.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you waited
You know what? You are right?!
Yes!!
I mean sex should not be a big problem!
There should not be all these rules and restrictions!
You know, people should be able to sleep with who they want, when
Rachel! I'll never think it's normal for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!

Push, push!
We are here!
Where have you been?
Long story, darling.
All right, Carol, you have to keep pushing. I need to apologize, could I have that?
Come on come.
Behind the back of my brother? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you will not hear from me.

So, I hear, you hate me!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about it.
A little bird told me something about you wanting to tear your arm out and throw it to me.
And you have a "hate" of that ?! You make a big jump there ...
Agree, agree, agree, agree, agree, agree, we need to do something to fix our little situation here, Joey.
So here's my idea: you and I spend quality time together.
But what will it do ...
For Chandler!
Guess what, I had an audition!
Awww, one of my students had an audition. I am so proud.
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for that?
You bet! What is the part?
Oh that's great, it's a role on

Hi! Hi! Hi. Has anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you.
He was with me, uh, we play a little game, see? Hide and seek.
You can not ask my son, it's cheating.
You're right, thank you for keeping me honest dad.
Well, it's better not to come here. He can not see the bride in the wedding dress.
If I remember the time we got married, I saw the groom in a wedding dress.
But it was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Honey, this is not luck.
Oh my God! Monica!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doing?
Awesome. He is doing very well. Do not worry about Chandler.
Are you OK?
Uh-huh.
Yes baby!
I'm really glad you were fine, but I keep thinking about what would happen if you had both been connected.

So, we had a good time at the strip club, right?
Oh yes, it was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress in the area stops to teach the third
I can not believe! He still has not called.
Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
What, he does not like Josh?
No I do not.
Okay, well, I'll put on my tracksuits.
Oh no!
Expect!
Expect!
Ok, you know what, you were right, you were right.
We really were not good at being guys, but you know why?
Because we are girls.
Phoebe, her music could not
Thanks thanks.
Yes, I lost it.
You know, I'm not going to play anymore, do you want to finish my set?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Yes, as I could
What?
I played intentionally bad guys.
Ok, so you were trying to play badly all this time.
Yeah-no, just this last song.

Oh, I thought I had people for the game.
Oh yes, who plays?
The players.
Someone seems to miss being the hostess.
Please, it's a relief, that's what it is, that's what it is.
Very good Pheebs, hold your plate!
Oh.

Whatever?
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he did not hear from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
Did you tell them he was missing?
No! I gave the impression that I was just calling to discuss. Of course, they both think I'm interested in them.
Who's is this?
I do not want to say.
Oh, come on! I do not care! Come on! Who's is this?
Diane Keaton.

Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why are not you still dressed ?!
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Look at this.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now, I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Really?!
Oh it's so exciting!
Thank you!
Thank you Monday!
Oh, but on Monday, if you still touch my guitar, I'll have to hammer you a little bit.
Pretty good, now, get ready!
Okay.
I'm going to get everyone, finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh, apparently, I opened the door to the past.

My best shoes, everything is fine for me.
I wear them every day.
Low heel, holes in the toes.
Do not worry about what people say.
The best friends of my feet, the friends at the end.
With them, I'm a hot chicky.
Although late one night, not much light, I ....
I got into something nasty.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time, I'll ... avoid the ...

My God, it's going to be so weird like when I come home and you're not here.
You know?
More than Joey and Chan.
No more than J and C.
"Do you want to go to Joey and Chandler's?"
"I can not, it's not there."
Listen, I'm just going to be through the hallway, we can always do the same thing.
Yes, but we will not be able to enjoy getting up in the middle of the night and talking at length about our feelings and the future.
We did not do that once.
Hi.
Hey!
Hi.
So I told Rachel that we would both be.
Oh yes? How did she take it?
Really good. Yeah. Surprisingly good. Yes, she did not cry. She was not angry or sad.
Uh-huh.
I will not do that.

Okay, if you need a vacuum cleaner, it's in my closet on the left. Oh, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
Okay, okay, but Rachel's going to be here too, can not I ask her that stuff?
Yeah, all right, try it!
Okay! Let's do it!
Woo-hoo !!
Yeah, darling!
London baby!
Hi!
Hi!
Monica? What time is it?
Uh, 9 years old.
But it's dark outside.
Well, it's because you always sleep until noon, idiot! Here is what looks like 9.
I guess I'll wash myself then. Look at this sunrise.
I am
I know me too.
Hey!
You know, if we went for a weekend?
You know we would not have any breaks and we could be naked all the time.
The whole weekend? It's a whole naked pile.
Yes, I can say that I have a conference and you can say that you have a chef thing.
Oh, I always wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey!
Okay, you do not know if. Let's go.
Expect! And for Joey?

Oh, there is also a book by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is it?
It seems like two people really appreciate the Dewey decimal system.
I am really sorry!
Sorry!
You did not bring

Hey!
Hi!
Oh you know, uh Kash, you really liked the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
Okay, I just have to go home first.
To save the game? You do this every time Ross, you're
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment has become available.
Oh, are you changing apartments?
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Yes, but when the baby comes, she will want to move.
She is?
Yeah, you did not expect her to live with a baby there, would you?
I guess I did not really think about it.
Ezel! Hey Gunther! You are an ezel!
Damn it!

Look what I have! Look what I have! Look what I have! Can you believe they are doing this for the little people?
Few people from the village.
Ok, look at this one. It is my favorite.
Oh, that's so nice!
I know! Phoebe will love to dress them up!
Huh. Except that Phoebe will not be the one to dress them.
Because she will not be able to keep babies.
Oh my God! We are launching the most depressing baby shower of all time!
Wait a minute!
Unless we give her all the presents she can use once her pregnancy is over.
Like-uh, ordinary coffee, Tequila.
Oh, and someone can get those leather pants she always wanted!
Oh, she'll love it!

Ok both of you ask the court a cancellation?
Yes, your honor, and here are forms, all filled.
So, on the basis of your motion, you are asking for an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Well, I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is an injection drug user.
What?!
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Crack is not even an intravenous drug!
Well, you would know it.
Now, it is also said here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh, come on!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
No!
Phoebe, just because I'm alone, does not mean I want to walk naked.
I mean, you live alone, you do not walk naked.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?

I know, I lied! I did not want her to think that I was a terrible mother! I can not even see my own baby!
Oh of course, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look here come look, that's it, it's right there.
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Do you really?
No, I do not see it!
Come on! Come on! Well, okay, okay, do you see that? This little thing that looks like a peanut?
Yeah.
Honey, that's it.
That's all? Well, I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thanks.
You are welcome.
Wow! I can not believe it's our baby.
Yes, it's our baby.

Gin.
We played Gin? You know, if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Do you want to stop!
Okay. Okay.
Ok, all right, I think you're great, I think you're nice, and you're smart, and I love you.
But you'll always be the guy who pissed on me.

Hey!
Hey!
Let me tell you about this girl with whom I scored last night! Oh no wait a minute it was you!
Hi, discover me, I'm a slut!
So you want to do something tonight?
Oh, I can not. Dr. Roger is coming again.
Oh.
Oh yes!
Right!
Because you always see him and uh, he's a good guy.
I mean, I remember a moment where
Are you OK?
Yeah! Totally! Totally and you?
Awesome! It's so amazing! I mean, the last time Dr. Roger came, I was
I bet he can.
You know, I do not have an appointment, but I could use a physics. Are you sure you are well?
Oh yes! Yeah! Do not worry about me, it'll be fine!

You have clean clothes. Now it's the important part.
Oh, I guess. Except that everything looks like jammies now.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this basket.
Yes, but if it is not? And if there is a reason we can not have a baby?
Oh, Chandler, listen. Monica and you must have children. I'm sure it'll be fine.
oh, oh, all right, thanks.
I can not believe I did not even think about that.
I guess I was so worried about having to ... come here and do ... "that" ...
What, you can do it on the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can not do it at a doctor?
It was a "Wendy's !!"

... and then Zana, just leave a tear !!
Listen, not that I like to talk about the people I went to high school with, because I do, but maybe we could talk about something else?
Like you, I do not even know where you work?
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a

Hey.
Hey!
So you stole my joke and you stole my money.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy storyteller that I'm a published writer.
Well, she'll know you stole the joke.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me there?
Yeah!
Well, I will not go now anyway.
Okay .
Here you are.
Ah, Gunther, I can not pay for it now because I do not work, so I had to reduce my luxury, like paying for things.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Euh, I do not know.
You see, it's just, see, I was a regular on a soap opera you know?
And to go from that to that, I come, plus, I would have to wait for all my friends.
Okay, but the money is good, plus you can watch Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a server. May I use the phone?

I do not have a name
Well, how are we supposed to call you?
Ok, for now, you can call me, Clint, temporarily.
No way you're cool enough to shoot Clint.
Ok, so what name am I cool enough to shoot?
Uh, Gene.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
See you later, Gene.
Goodbye, Gene.
It's Clint!
What's going on with Gene?

Welcome to Las Vegas.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Yes I did it. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
I hope you had a good flight.
Ohh, it was the best!

Oh, Larry.
Umm, do the health inspectors work on the commission?
No, bribes.
It's good to laugh, no?
Come on Joey !!!
Rachel, I told you everything I knew last night!
Listen, it's not a big deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I can not believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler make love.
No! I mean come on! It's a
I do not know.
Is he romantic with her?
I do not know.
Are they in love?
I do not know.
You know nothing.
Ohh, I know one thing!
What?
They did it on the couch.

Excuse me, listen, we've been here for over an hour and many less sick people than my friend have come in.
I mean, this guy with the toe thing?
Who is he sleeping with?
Oh, come on Dora, do not be angry ...
I know we both said things we did not want to say, but that does not mean that we still do not love each other.
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

You see, Molly, what people do not understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of work.
So where did you study?
Oh, I did not go to college.
No, where did you study acting?
Molly ... people do not study acting ...
Molly, do you want to leave us a minute?
Of course, I'll go see Emma.
Thank you
Will the stable boy never have the princess ??
What do you think you'll do, sleep with her here on my couch?
No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
You know, it's not fair.
What makes you think I'm going to sleep with her, then send her?
Huh?
Can not you open your mind to the possibility that I really love it and that I may want something real?
Look, the truth is I did not feel that way for someone since Rachel, okay?
I did not think I could love again.
Come on! Joe!
Okay
Hi, Molly is here?
Yeah, come in. Molly?
Hey! Guys, it's Tabatha. I will see you tomorrow.
Ok ... Joey, I guess we have no problem.
It's as if my favorite fairy tale is coming true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!

And what's cool is that the character comes from Naples, right?
Yeah.
My whole family is from Naples!
Oh that's great! Okay, I heard everything I needed to hear. I just need to, uh, Leslie
Joey, that's the awkward part.
Oh!
Oh yes!
No problem.
I understand perfectly.
Make sure I do not have terrible tattoos or scars.
Do not worry I have nothing to hide.
So here it is me.
One hundred percent natural!
I tell you, it never happened before.

This room is available.
Okay!
OK wait!
You listen to me!
You listen to me!
Since I'm waiting for four women, it's four, one more than the number of centimeters I'm dilated, have come and gone with their babies!
I am next!
It's my turn!
It's only fair!
And if you bring a woman and she has her baby in front of me, I will sue you!
Not this hospital, I will sue you!
And my husband, he's a lawyer!
Uh Rach
Come back on this darling affair!
I do not think the next patient is very far away.
Ok, so bring her here.
OH MY GOD!!!

Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from this guy and guy. And that one-guy! They are all huge!
They do not look bigger than me!
Well, maybe it's because you're closer to you. So, you seem bigger of where you are.
I'm just going to say hello to the guys. Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Hi.
Whoa! I liked that a bit.
Ok, I know what I have to do. I have to go Red Ross. You know Red Ross!
I do not know what you're talking about.
Come on! The time we all waited online
You know, you gave me a lot more support when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do it, we'll support you like crazy.
Yeah.
We just want you to think about it.
Yes, darling, maybe you can talk to someone who has had a baby. Like your mom?
My mother never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mother did.

Umm, thank you for meeting me.
Thank you. Okay.
Come and sit down.
Sit.
Sit down!
Umm, all right, before we start, I just - I need you to declare for official registration that you're actually Frank Buffay.

Six lucky ....
Everyone is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. It's Monica.
Hi!
And Joey ....
Hi!
And Ross.
Hi!
He does not speak much English.
Look at this!
So, uh ... where does Paolo come from?
Oh ... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight in the building. Suddenly. In our lifes.
Well, the cat ... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
It's funny, and Rachel keeps touching him.
Well. I looked everywhere in the building and I could not find the kitty anywhere.
Oh, I found it. It was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! Here! Last to know again! And I guess ... since no one told me ... it's Paolo.
Ah, Paolo, it's Phoebe.
You betcha!

Okay, where the hell did you get that ?!
When mom and dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose watered, I went swimming in the lake and fished it.
This cup is mine!
No it is not! You want it, you will have to win it!
Okay, so are not we dine at all?
Why?
Because I do not work at the Szechwan dragon.
Okay.
You really, really need to sleep, darling.
I know what I do.
Hi.
Hi.
Guess what?
What?
They published my article.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Rachel, look! Oh hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come save me. Here it is.

Oh my God.
You know what it is, we are preparing for the prom.
Oh.
What?! You kicked us out !!
I told you not to go!
Well, he made Rachel cry!
Rachel is still crying!
This is not true!
Now Joey, you go there and you suck it. I mean you are afraid as you have never feared before!
Okay! I'll try! But if I can not, you can stay with Chandler and me until you are settled.
Go!!
Okay, okay, okay.
I mean, I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with that.

So, he's just a nice guy. Do you really think this brand wants nothing in return for helping?
Well, I guess I'll have to take showers with him, but you know, that's true for any job.
How are you feeling?
Well, my apartment is gone, because I drank it.
Where did you have too? We lost you after opening all the presents.
Yeah.
Yes, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Woooo hoooo !!!
Ow, no "woo-hooing", no "woo-hooing".
Why did it happen?
Oh, I had fun with Joey's sister. Well, it's not the worst.
What is the worst part?
I do not remember which sister.
You see what men do! Do not tell me that men are not nice! It's the men !!

What's wrong?
Nothing!
Well, I had that blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, and then I fainted and uh, I have not been able to get up since.
But uh, I do not think it's serious.
It looks like a hernia. You must go to the doctor!
No way!
"Kay, look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything, it will be because it gets me out of the stomach!
Why do I have to start exercising again?
Cursed 15s!
It's a trifle.
He has all these layers.
First there is a layer of lady's fingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.
[Joey and Ross make funny faces] Then raspberries, lady's fingers, then sautéed beef with onions and peas,
then a little more custard, then bananas, and then I just put whipped cream on it!
It tastes like feet!
I love it.
Are you kidding?

Does anyone else think that David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks you're a fox.
Welcome everyone, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Oh oh! It's new!
Guys, can we please do not look that well.
Hush!
People, has this ever happened to you?
You go to the refrigerator to get a good glass of milk, and these boxes are so difficult to open.
Oh, you said it to Mike. Aw! There must be a better way!
And there is Kevin.
Can we please disable this?
Noo way, Kevin.
A revolutionary new product ensures you will never have to open milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Are you intrigued?
You flingin'-flangin 'right I am!
Remember that he has never used this product before, you will see how easy it is to do.
Go forward.
It works with any carton of milk.
Wow, it's easy. Now, I can have milk every day.

Well, you might want to tell him that his wife is gay.
She is not She is gay. Oh my God. She is
Good day for the bride and groom, huh?
I'm sorry, your husband cheated on you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women are not so good either.
Try saying that to my wife.

Hey Ross, will you give me that knife?
I can not wait to be with you!
I'll sneak in as soon as Ross gets Ben.
I'm just going to tell Rachel that I'm going to do the laundry for a few hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is this my new nickname?
Awww, you know what's your nickname, Mr. Big
Arghh !!

I can not believe I'm going to lose this job!
Oh I'm so sorry dude! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge in front of the security guard.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah?
Well, I do not want to talk to you Wayne!
I hate you!
You ruined my life!
Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
Wayne, Chandler.
Hi how are you?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I-I'll take you back to your job if you help me.
Why should I help you ?!
The reason he just said.
What do you need?
I - I - I - I saw you on stage talking to this beautiful woman, do you know Sarah?
What?
And I too am only a machine for love.
Ross, let me show you where the room is.

Oh, I thought it was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He is just the nicest little man!
A plus Phoebe! Oh and hey, thank you for taking part!
Did you contribute ?!
Yeah, uh, huh, 100 bucks.
Phoebe! I can not believe you gave them money! I thought you had agreed that it was totally unreasonable to have asked for this money!
Yes, but they did not ask me!
You know?
In this way, I'm just, you know, this exotic and generous stranger.
It's always fun to be.
Yes, but you make me look bad!
No I'm not.
No!
If anything, I make you better!
They will see you talk to me and it's - I'm a success!
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh hi Ross.
Uh, see, I thought maybe you could change your apartment because Phoebe is more like us.
Something to think about.
Yeah, all right, my bad.

Okay, okay, okay ...
Right here. I need to borrow moisturizer.
Why?
Whaddya think? Today is the big day!
Oh my God. Ok, go to the bathroom, use what you want, but never tell me what you did in there.
Thank you!
Where is Joey? His mother is on the phone.
He is in the bathroom. I do not think you want to go!
Come on, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...
Who is strong?
Oh, it would be Monica.
Hey, listen, I want to borrow a couple, Aurora has spent the night, I really want to make her breakfast.
Oh, you have all night, huh?
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes to Ethan, so, you know ...
Ooh, do I feel a little resentment?
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.
'Kay?
You know, in a relationship, do you have those key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
Well, every second is like that with Aurora ... and I just lost about 35 to talk to you, so, uh ... Monica, can you help me with the door?
Sure.
Oh, uh, Chandler?
You know, old Monica would like to remind you to scrub this teflon pan with a plastic brush ... But I'm not going to do that.

Hi Monica, it's Joey!
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even if you're a big star!
Aw, come on! It will be years before I forget you!
Joey, how are you doing on a movie set, huh?
Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, yeah, yeah, I have it all.
Yes, listen, I want you to tell Chandler that he could not have been more wrong!
Uh-oh!
I have to go Monica, my sushi is here!
Sorry about that. Thank you for waiting.
Everyone smiles! OK thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay in

Wow, that's so cool, guys. The whole city is blackened!
Mom says that everything is in Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they do not know when it will come back.
Wow, guys, it's big.
Pants and a sweater?
Why mom?
Who will I meet in a power outage?
Electricity companies?
Eligible looters?
Can we talk about it later?
OKAY.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check my grandmother. What is my number?
Well, I never call

What are you doing?
Swim.
What about the girl?
Chicks do not swim.
Are you sure?
I do not know. Should we try it?
Sure.
You see, I told you they do not swim.
Expect. Give him a minute.
Noo! Oh, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.

Take care of yourself is not a problem, huh?
You feel safe.
Right?
Okay, I'm going to take this spit bubble like, "Yeah, yes!"
Ok, after I get rid of that dirty diaper, Leslie, I'll get you a clean one.
OK I am sorry.
I did not want to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.
Okay?
Because let's face it, we're at Monica's.
I broke it.
Okay.
Well, it's just the way it's going.
Okay, good.
Why are there only two of you?
Where is Leslie?
Well, you can not answer.
Leslie?
Where are you Leslie?
Leslie, now would be a

Hey!
Hey.
Hey, why are you sponging your ceiling?
Oh, there is banana on it.
You said she was bald.
Yes, she was bald, she is not now.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
I do not know, I hardly ever talk about that.
Oh, well, it's just perfect!
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Yes, I said what was wrong when I thought it was a strange bald girl. I mean, you know, this girl has hair
Well, maybe it will not work. Maybe Ross will not like his personality.
Why does she have a bad personality?
Oh no, Bonnie is the best!

Hey!
Hey.
Do you have a minute? I would like to talk to you about something that I am, I am really uncomfortable talking.
Sure. What? Do you shower with your mother?
I actually had a topic in mind! I am going through a period of sexual drought.
Whoa, for months?
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, do you like sexually strange things?
No!
Oooh, wrong answer.

Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, hush!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I did not want to make noise!
So do not break in !!
Oh yes, Smokey Joe found himself halfway down the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a two year old child.
So why are you smoking?
Well it's very disturbing.

Honey, I was wondering ....
Hmm?
Do you still have this navy uniform?
Nooo, I had to return it instead of the costume.
Hmm.
I think I have a former high school group uniform.
Do you remember not having sex in high school, right?
Yeah.
Well, darling, what about you?
What?
I mean, do you have fun, you know, fantasy things?
No.
Go on, you must have one!
Ugh!
I do not know Monica.
It's funny to be right here.
I mean, if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, it's like betraying Chandler.
Not at these prices.
Hi. You know, in England, that car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You must feel this bad boy.
Um, Monica, it's so weird, you know, Chandler is your friend ... Oh!
Oh my God!
Oh, okay, take this bed, you can make other friends.

You know, since I was little, I was able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Good for you. Uh, neighborhoods or rolls of neighborhoods?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you off from all my photos. So, if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Its good.
Oh, are you sure?
Really?
Because you know, you can make small puppets and use them in your theater of cruelty.
We can not do that.
What? What can not you do?
She really said that?
Well, I added the part "exactly like me" ...
But she said she was looking for someone and someone would be here tonight.
Tonight tonight?
Well, I think it's perfect.
You know, it'll be just the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey ...
I do not remember the last time a girl took care of my monkey.
Anyway, I thought after work I would go get a bottle of wine, go there and, uh, try to woo her.
Hey, you know what you should do? You should bring it back to the 1890s, when this phrase was last used.

The car is waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop these copies of my book for your friends. Do you want something from Lisbon?
No, just know that you will be there.
Well, well, be good, I love you.
You kissed my best Ross! ... or something to that effect.
Okay. Look, it was stupid.
Really stupid.
Really stupid.
And I do not even know how it happened.
I'm sorry, darling, I promise it will never happen again.
Are you okay now?
Yeah. No no...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Hush He did it. He told her, and not just about the kiss, everything.
You're kidding.
No no. He said, "When are you going to grow up and start being a mother?"

Oh that's it.
These are not your usual dry cleaners.
I know, but this scourge that I went on that date is going on there, so I have to find a new one.
I also need to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
What?!
A new grocery store.
The universe told me that I was going to meet a good guy and that's what they gave me?
When I'm up there, I'll kick ass.
Do not worry Phoebe, you'll meet someone. If I can meet a good guy, you can too.
Yes, we can both. And we will do it both.
Oh, you did not have to come with me.
Are you kidding? This is where they get stained! Okay? It's like
Okay.
Oh excuse me! I think you dropped Wow!
What?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're incredibly beautiful.
Oh yes, I'm sorry for that too, but what are you going to do?
I hope you do not think I'm crazy, but I feel like I have to, do you believe in that kind of thing?
A little. Now you speak.
Do you want to go out and have a cup of coffee?
I-I-I would. Let me just tell my friend.
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get that?
She had to leave.

Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We are in the same team!
Four hours? Have you been doing this for four hours?
That's right baby.
Okay, let me in.
No no! Do not do it! Do not!
What?
It's a dropper!
Oh yes, it's true!
I am not a dropper!
It's really a game for three people, you see?
It's throwing and catching!
Okay.
Oh! Oh! It's so hard.
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Oh my-Oh good God!
I'll let you down, I do not know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Cooking did not help, huh?
Okay, the place was closed. I will just copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rachel, why are not you moving with me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm fine, I mean, I mean Rach, I know I scared you with all Naked Thursday stuff, but we do not have to do it!
Well, it would be easier to get just across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you think of Naked Wednesday's.
Thursday is clearly not good for you, choose a day!

So that's two boxes of holiday macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Admit him simply Chandler, you have no setbacks.
Excuse me, my child, I have a very solid setback.
Protecting your face and screaming like a girl ... is not a setback.
I was screaming ... like a navy.
Everything here. Watch me perform the three 'P's of the championship game. Power. Precision. and penache.

She is not really a person on the phone.
Yeah, so, uh, so, what's up with that father, I mean, if someone had my baby somewhere, I'd like to know, you see?
Hey, Knick fan, do you have any interest in paternity? Uh no.
Ok, maybe I should go there.
Maybe you should.
Good luck and take care of yourself, huh?
You know what's the Celtics problem? They let the players lead the team.
Oh, that's not true.
Oh, that's it.
It's not.
It is.
Is not!

Okay ladies, that ends today's class and, remember, let's be safe.
It's a good class.
Thank you.
Yes, yes, I was watching.
Uh, hey, a few questions though.
Uh, about this last move where the woman tripped you and then stuck you on the ground, what-what-what would you do next?
Well, she would take her keys and try to trap them
No no no. No. What would
Who? Me the attacker?
I'm sorry, Chandler, you know you're such a nice boy and I do not want to hurt you.
Oh, I wish I could do something to make you feel better.
No-no-really ?!
Of course!
Well, it hurts so much. I uh
Oh I am sorry.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
What?! Whatever! Whatever!
Well, uh, I mean, I do not talk about that now, but I have this friend.
That actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing it, but would it be possible for him to audition for your film on Thursday?
Absolutely! But would you really feel better than I reject you if your friend actor can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I will see you later.

Ok, I have that. I'm going to escape there. I will come back here. Okay, come on
Hey guys. Listen, I'm sorry to have misplaced the game before - Oh my God! Your friends have unhappy initials!
They are all Chandler.
Chandler is bad! He could not have had that good!
I did. But that had a price.
But Ben is coming tonight and he can not see that.
Oh come on, at the age of seven, children have already seen orgies. Was it just me ?!

Sure!
Okay, I thought we should have a nice spare room, right?
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on it all the time!
And we could have a desk with comment cards so that people can tell how much they liked to stay here !!
Okay, whatever, I really did not think so much.
I like this idea.
Obviously!
I thought maybe, maybe, maybe it could be a game room, you see?
I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
No.
Ok, you mean no, because "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea, let's discuss it before rejecting it completely."
Oh I am sorry. Of course I think so. Interesting idea, uh, talk about it, but no.
So that's it?
I do not think arcade games go into the beautiful room. The beautiful guest room will be filled with antiques.
That is why
What do you have against the beautiful room?
I have nothing against the beautiful room, especially that everyone knows less than 30 seconds!
Are you making fun of me?
No, I do not make fun of you or your beautiful guest room.

You know, I love doing crosswords with you, darling!
Oh me too. Now, let's finish this and go to bed.
Okay! There is only one word left, three letters, not dog but
Cat.
Yes! You are so clever! I love you.
I love you too.

I never sucked, I did not want you to know how good I was!
Why?
I do not know.
It's awesome! We can now participate in doubles tournaments!
It is

Hey!
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has
But
No! No no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended it to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Okay. Okay, but you can not send it back today.
Why not?!
Because I unload it today.
What?! You said he was sweet!
he
Just do not pick up your phone.
Then he comes! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
What? So now, I'm not allowed to fire him?
You can not send him away and throw him away the same day, he will commit suicide.
Okay, I'm going to fire him today and you'll go out with him another week.
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'm going to kill
Okay, so we'll do both today and he'll just have to deal with it!
Okay. But the question is who will go first. Because whoever goes second is the dog.
Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You will see.

This is the last stop of flight 664 to Yemen.
Well, I guess I have to go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I will wait for you. Do you even know how long you will be gone?
Well, until we find a source of energy to replace the fuel.
Oh. Well, I correct you every day. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Okay goodbye. Goodbye.
Chandler?
No!
Chandler!
Janice!
There you are!
There you are!
I had to have one last kiss, and you also said you were going to leave right after my flight!
No! No! I want to see you take off.
Well, I guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we arrive in Yemen, can I stay with you?

Hi!
Hey.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda doing? Does she work?
Oh, my new assistant is working, yes.
Was she happy that you gave her the job?
Oh, my new assistant was very happy to have hired my new assistant.
Hello?
Oh hey!
Can you, can you stick to a second?
These are the producers at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.E.
can you excuse me for a minute?
Hey, funny, you should call.
I was just watching the script next week.
Canceled?!
As if they were removing the air?
Ohh
Okay, to Monday.
We did not even shoot them anymore? !!
Okay goodbye!
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Sorry.
I'm sorry Joey.
Why would they do this? It was a good show, was not it ?!

It's so isolated here.
I know. I like it here.
I feel like we are the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
What is the darling problem? Did you see a little mouse?
No no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would-you-in fact, would you like to check that?
Honey, we do not have bears here.
Well, ok. Would you like to get me a
Okay. I'll be right back.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
What are
I came with Paul!
Yes, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!
Here you go darling!
Ahh Thank you!
Coke Light
What was that?!
A lesson on the importance of unagi.
Ohh
Maybe Now, I'm curious to know when from those screams of girl would you have started to
Okay, so we were not
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to defend my point of view, but I'm looking, I just want you to be safe.

What are you doing?
I'm leaning This is where I lean.
Okay. (Go up and stuff the pillows on the couch.
Brenda a bee!
What?
Yes! He flew in your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest he sting you!
I think I know what's going on here.
You do?
Look, I know it must be hard for your wife to be lesbian, but that's wrong. You are married.
I understand perfectly. Can I

Okay, let's do it!
No no no. What was that?
I know, it was the best I could get.
Well, people!
People, people, people.
Let's try again and this time, let's watch everyone watching Joey.
Show them how it's done.
Count the shot.

So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan receive an invitation or not?
Oh, my God, no one likes it, and it's so cheap that it would never fly to London in a million years.
Yes, invite him?
Hey, did I do that pretty well?
Yes, they are fine.
Yeah?
If anyone asks, we'll just say that Ben has spoken to them. Oh! So did you invite Rachel then?
Sure. Why not?
Really?
Yeah?
I do not think I would be comfortable with one of my old lovers there.
Wait, wait, wait, do you think we should not invite him?
Oh, no-no, you absolutely love Rachel, it's just that, well, it could be embarrassing for you.
But that's absolutely your decision.
No more tea?
Yes of course.
Earl Gray?
Huh? Yeah, all right, invite whoever you want.

Hi.
Hey!
Hey! So, how was the doctor?
Oh, everything went well.
Well.
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Oh.
I do not see the baby. Where is it?
Oh no, I know I could not see him either at first, but it's true, um, Ross, I lost again.
Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs it.

Excuse me?
Could you help me with something?
The patient I am looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
And uh, it's from the beginning to the middle of the thirties, very attractive.
I think I know who you are talking about.
Oh yes! Awesome! Ok, what room number is it?
I'm sorry, this information is for hospital staff only
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Dr. Drake who?
Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need this information. I am a doctor.
A doctor in this hospital?
Cursed woman, we are wasting precious time! Now, do you want this man's blood on your head?
Hands.
Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me in which room the man described by my assistant remains.
He's one of my patients, I've been treating him for years!
He is in room 816.
816, thank you!
Thank you.
And what is his name?
No!

Hi!
Hi!
Rachel was just helping me. My head was burned by the sun.
Awww.
Thank you so much.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Ok, I see you in our room.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
I know.
Ok, I have to go.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Well, I-I'm going to break up with Bonnie.
Right here?! Now?!
Well yeah.
I can not - I can not stay here all night, and if I go, she'll - she'll ... do stuff.
What happened?
He will not get there, he's stuck in Chicago.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is so lucky!
Stupid and useless Canadian currency!

Rachel, one of your clients seems to have left his wallet. A Joshua Bergen.
Really?
Do you want to call him?
Yes!
I go!
Absolutely!
(She pulls out her license and her license and holds them face to face.
She then acts as Dark Helmut in

Oh my God! It's so good!
I'm full and yet I know that if I stop eating that, I'll regret it.
Hey!
Hey!
What do you have here?
Oh it's uh, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
What are you doing tonight?
Huh? uh
Guy! Guy!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I have plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had an appointment at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
That's what Monica says.
After she gave me this great speech ?!
She's going to meet a guy the same night she has plans with me?
I think she's trying to shoot a quick on Big Daddy!

Ok, is this lamp in the same place?
We do not care? I repel the women.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no !!! You can not come here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
What?!
It's yours!
Yeah, I'm a slut.
Me too.
Hi Jill!
Hey!
Hi .
Rachel
Rachel! Well, you are not at home, you are here.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Okay. So good, I'll take her home around midnight.

This part was perfect for me! I can not believe I did not get it!
I'm sorry, man.
Hey, you know what you should do?
You should do something for yourself.
You know, like writing a play.
Write a movie!
Huh?
I mean, what about those
Come on Ross, be realistic, see? If I wrote something, what are the chances that I can play these guys?
Wait a second, I could play!
Where.
I can not write!
You know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I do not have the discipline that takes, you see
I can not do it
I will help you.
Yes, I will establish a timetable and make sure you respect it.
And besides, it will give me something to do.

Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do you do?
Oh, especially fashion, so there can be models here from time to time, I hope it's cool.
Yes it's cool. Because I have models here you know ...... never.
Oh, yes, during the summer, I spend most weekends in my sister's beach house, which you can use by the way.
Although I should probably tell you that she is a porn star.
Well, listen, I still have someone to meet, but unless it's your sister, I think your chances are good.
Okay.

As bad as it may be, I really enjoyed myself. I think I'll apologize for all the nonsense I'm doing.
Why do not you just stop doing stupid things? So you would not have to apologize.
I would really love if I could do both.
Okay, I have to ask.
What?
Are you going to break up with me if I get fat again?
What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have won?
One hundred and forty-five pounds.
Yes yes it is. It's always on the lips! Why?! Why on the lips ?!
This is Frannie. Hmm, she will not be happy to see me?
Now, wait a minute, be nice! Okay? I did not bring you here so you could ambush him.
Frannie was the one who found your
This bitch!
Monica! What
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that ?!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
You invite my brother, you invite all my family and not me ?!
Why?!
Why do not you want me at your wedding?
What could I possibly do?
Stuart!
I think you know my husband.
So it's really a question of

Hi girls! What are you here for?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yeah?
It's a crime that you and I do not spend more time together.
What's up?
Well, I heard you were thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe we should have a discussion.
Man to me, me.
Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you crazy? If you live with Phoebe, you will live together!
Yes, I thought about that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.
Hey! Oh listen, I just free up space for your stuff.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was right at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they do not move.
What do you mean, they do not move? They're still moving in, are not they?
No-no, they just had a big rash on what to do with my room.
What?! On a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel pretty bad for them, but I'm also very excited because I do not need to move in here!
Oh no, yes no, this part is great!

Yes
Exclude!!
Where are you guys? Come on, one more game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yeah, get out!
You are still in my apartment!
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?
Come on, fools!
Okay, okay, I have to go.
I'm going and I'm gone
One more game?
Oh yes!

I am sorry.
Ohhh, do not leave.
No, I-I-I have to go.
No no! No! No!
Honey, darling, people are searching.
I do not care! I do not care !!
Yeah, I'm, I'm leaving now.
You can not leave! I have your shoe!
Goodbye Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those of Burgendy.

Oh, ew!
What?
Yes, I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?
Because I can and my mother could not, I thought it was something I had received from our father.
What, wait, do you mean like that?
Yeah yeah. You can do it for.
You do not do it.
Oh yes, all right, my mother could, and I can not. We do not have that ...
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any ... Do we have thoughts here?
Well, I've never used the tunnel myself, because if I understand correctly, you're not allowed to cross more than one girl in the car, that's it.
But, it seems to me that it's a bit like anything else, you know, face your fear.
He is afraid of heights, you go to the top of the building!
If you are afraid of bugs, get one.
Right.
In this case, you are afraid to commit yourself, so I tell you that you are going there and that you are the most engaged type of person.
Surprisingly, that makes sense.
You think?
Oh yes. Go ahead guy, jump off the top diver, fix the gun barrel, pee in the wind!
Yes, Joe, I assure you that if I look in the barrel of a gun, I almost piss in all directions.

Hey! Hey!
Hi!
Hi! Look! Our images were developed at Rockefeller Center.
Oh great! Hi Joey, do you want to look at pictures of Mona and my skater?
Oh uh, normally I'd love it too, but I'm overwhelmed right now.
Hey, where are the photos that the pretzel seller took from us together?
Oh yes, probably in the end. Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
I miss the time of the photo ?!
You know she has a Ross face!
Okay. Ok, here is a good one of us.
Wow!
Here is a good one!
Wow, it looks like a holiday card, you see, with the tree in the middle, the skaters and the snow.
You know, every year I say I'm going to send holiday cards and I never do.
Do you want to send this one together?
Together? I like people?
Yes, you know. Happy holidays of Mona and Ross. It will be cute, okay?
Okay.
Oh, I have to get to work. So call me later?
Uh, of course.
Goodbye people.

I mean, I do not even feel like having a girlfriend anymore.
Do you want me to leave my job so that you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
Is it about Mark?
Oh my God.
Okay, it's not, it's not.
Oh my God. I can not continue to have the same fight with you, Ross! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Well, you're right.
Let's take a break, let's go, let's take some frozen yoghurt or something
No, a break from us.

Bing! We are all ready for tonight, 8 hours.
Oh, it turns out we can not do it. Monica has to work.
Oh, my ex-wife did not work unless you called for her mother to work. Well. Tomorrow night then.
Oh, well, tomorrow is not good for her either.
Oh? Why not?
This is the semifinal of his botchy ball tournament.
What's going on Bing? Does your wife have a problem with me or something?
Well now, now, you're just talking crazy.
So why can not we all go out together?
Because uh we ... we separated. Monica and I separated. Hold me.
Good God Bing I can not say that I am quite surprised, I saw how she looked at you and there was no love there.
And the way she looked at me, the pure desire.
You know, what could really help me through this difficult time stifles something. Can I choke you?
Bing boy, we'll get you out.
Now here is the plan, take your coat, we go to a strip club.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would be panicked. But damn this bitch.

Look at yourself, sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel ... with Emma's chubby little hands around you.
It's good Emma, ​​you're asleep.
: Get away from the cradle, I have a weapon!
It's good, it's good Rachel, it's me. Put the darling.
What are you doing?
Well, I heard Emma stir, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Oh, oh thanks. Well, now that I'm up, I'm going to the bathroom.
There you are, darling ... It's not over.

Did he call?
No, sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he would call. Why did not he call?
Perhaps it is suggested by very intelligent, strong and successful women.
Sophie, please, come out of my ass. Why did not he call Rachel? Why?
OK OK. Uh, well, maybe he, maybe he feels uncomfortable because you're my boss.
Embarrassing? Why should he feel clumsy?
Well...
The only person who should feel embarrassed is you and you did not tell him not to call me, did you?
No I...
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend with someone you work for, there is always a way to fix that ... that.

And you're angry because you did not make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I ask is just a little emotion!
Is it too much to ask after six years ?!
I mean what?
Are you-Rachel and I not as close as you guys ?!
I mean, do not we have fun so much ?!
Do not I deserve some tears? !!
I mean, we ... we said to Joey, he cried his eyes!
Hey!
I did not cry my eyes !!
Come on!
It's like the end of an era!
No more than J-man and Channie!
!
Ok, I have to ask, who's calling us that ?!

Do I know why we are rushing?
Yeah, you know ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
Well, it turns out she wants to come back with me.
Oh, I found it!
!
It's great for you!
Yeah!
Good luck with your girlfriend.
Oh thank you. Eh eh. Rachel !!!!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Yeah, oh hey, you're on time.
So, what are you saying? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, you can do a lot.
Ahhhh !!

Ooh! I am sorry! I think I think that may have missed the table!
Make
Ah,
Make
Ah,
DO YOU?
You know, I do not understand why they did not cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Oh, come on.
Hey!
All you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we learned a lot from mom and dad!
And that image of Chi-Chi with his mischievous smile.
And what you said about Nana.
Ohh, yes, she really wanted to be here.
And you know what?
I think she was.
Oh God, Ross! How do you do that?

You forget how many great Heart songs had.
Yeah.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So you heard it, you repeated it, so it means you wrote it.
Oh, guys, with that joke. I must say, I know I've cracked, but I'm not even sure I have it.
What, did not you have it? The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can not write prescriptions.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think "Hef" would disagree, that's why he sent me a hundred dollar check ah

I can not find garbage bags!
Oh, I think I saw it here.
What is it?!
I do not know! But maybe if we keep this drawer closed, he'll die.
I can not believe we live here!

You still have not told Rachel that you are not really proposing?
No! She had the ring, she seemed so excited, then she pulled her chest.
Joey, you have to tell him what's going on! And what was it like ?!
I did not look at it. The stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Go tell Rachel before Ross discovers it.
Look, it's not so easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I do not want to hurt her.
Ok, look, do it gently.
You are right.
You are right.
I'll tell him now before Ross discovers it and I'll be sweet.
I can do it.
I am a sweet person.
Oh, by the way.
Two people kissing if you want to check that.

Hi Pheebs?
Ok, so just talk to the nurse and the reason your doctor is late is because, uh, she's not coming.
What?!
Ok, uh, it's that tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and uh, it's like those really scary manners in England.
Which
How would you describe the theme of this book, see here, Rachel Green?
Uh, well I must say it's a tragic love story.
Well, it's kind of given, but yes. Someone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, la-la uh, the savageness of morals, which
Excellent! What Rachel cleverly observed here
You completely stole my answer!
Well, honey, that was pretty obvious.
Well, how would you know ?! You did not even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
I think your question is a question with a lot of answers.
Would you like to venture one?
Would have
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Are you repeating what are you
All right, let's move on.
OK then.

Alright, all right, that's great, uh, Chandler, you're behind the desk.
And - and when she arrives with hope, she will not recognize you because, why would she?
Uh, all right, and then you buzz Ross and me.
You are Mr. Gonzalez, and I will be uh, Mr. Wong.
Diverse.
Did someone call for security?
Be cool.
Ok, which of you is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Where is my ring? The wedding ring of my dead grandmother? Where is it? Where is it?
Way to be cool, man.
What is he talking about?
There was a ring, in a box, on my bedside table, after you left, she was gone!
Wait, do you think I stole a ring?
We know you've taken so just-just save time and confess!
Ok, who are you?
Hardy boys?
Look, I do not need to steal a stupid ring, okay?
I earn $ 1,600 a week doing what I do; one of you doing that?
Marry me.

Oh my God! Joey!
Hell yeah! I'm going to marry you!
You can not marry him!
Hey ma'am, your day is over! It's my turn!
Phoebe!
Why?! Why can not she marry me ?!
I can and I want!
She's not pregnant It's Rachel. Rachel is the one who is pregnant.
Oh my God.
Hey!
Phoebe I think he would realize if you did not have a baby in nine months!
It's Joey!
Now I can not believe it! What? Rachel is pregnant? Who is the father?
We do not know
Ohh I wonder if this guy.
Is there a guy?
Yeah.
Who? Who is it?
About a month ago, this guy spent the night with Rachel, I did not see who it was, but
Was this story over?
The guy left that.
Oh my God! I know who the father is
People have to finish their stories!

Oh my God, you're back!
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I want to see what's in the hand. I want to see the trash.
Yeah.
Eww! Oh, everything is dirty. You should throw this away.
No!
Me too!
Hey, when the music started again, maybe I thought about going into the robot, you know?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we do not want to look stupid!
Good we are back! We have ten seconds left! Ten! New! Eight! Seven!
Three two one!
Cut!
No! Year! Happy new year no!
Ok, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, good job everyone's a wrap!

So Lizzie, are you planning on staying the night?
Oh no-no, believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Well. Well. Not that we do not want you to stay, obviously, you're welcome. How much more homework do you have?
I see. You know, Phoebe makes rabbits in socks.
No!
No, she does not.
Uh Phoebe, what she's doing is ... these are rabbit socks.
They are completely different, okay!
Okay!
Okay!
I did not do it!
I am sorry!
I totally forgot tonight and the fact that we are supposed
Oh that's good. I do not
No, no, that's wrong!
It's not!
I mean you were right You're so amazing!
You spent all this time and all these efforts to make this tape for me!
You know I'm just going ... I'm going to invent that for you!
I go!
I go
Well, I thought a lot about the band.

No. Then I called him and he was not there.
Well, then he's probably out.
Oh, thank you very much, I'm glad you came.
Hello.
Hi! It's me.
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Really? I thought, it's crazy, I mean, do not you think we can work on it?
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Who is it?
Nobody.
Can I finish the apple juice?
Is it Mark?
Uh, darling, look, he just ...
Yeah! I got it!
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come Dance.
Oh ok, thank you.
Hey, you do not have to smile. You just have to dance.
Listen, I do not want to dance, I want to have a drink. Okay?
Oh ok. Hey, two beers.

Do you want to go to the room? It's a little more comfortable.
Sure.
Okay. Oh, wait! Umm, did you send these contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of ​​sexy conversation?
No seriously, you know the contracts I gave you, did you spend the night?
Which contracts?
Ok please, tell me it's just one of your jokes that you do that I do not understand.
Like that?
You know, like when you put the phone in your pants?
Label!
I'm serious!
It's not funny!
These contracts were absolutely to be concluded today!
Rach, I'm sorry, but you did not give me a contract!
Yes I did it! And I put a little
I tell you, you never gave them to me.
You know what, if we went down to the office, you'd see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I'd see you embarrassed because they're
Or maybe you'd be embarrassed because you're talking on the phone with your crotch!
Do you want to go to the office right now?
No! Come late, we're not going to the office.
OK I understand. I would not be wrong either.
Ok, go get your coat! Oh! When did you get that? Good work!

Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, and I need to talk to you.
On what?
To see if you know what these guys are talking about.

Pheebs, how are you?
I'm fine. I think it's okay. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking too fast?
No, sounds like me. Pheebs, that's fine. Look at Chandler with little girl Chandler.
Little girl Chandler, where did I hear that before?
Oh yes, Coach Ruben.
Do you know what Pheebs?
When you're done there, we have a little situation here too.
No, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
See where I think you are wrong. We played these babies man for man; we should really play a zone defense.
What do you mean?
Forgive me? You have not taken my calls for a week!
Well, I'm totally out of Chandler. Friends forever! Do not come here!
Uh, what was that?
uh

... I'm fine.
It sounds good. I'll call you or you'll call me, whatever ...
Okay.
Goodbye.
Whoo Hoo!
Yes that's it!
Second appointment!
...I do not know.
You
Well, she looks very nice and all, but all that for her to come here, just to see if it's okay?
I mean ... how much is it necessary?

Do you remember when a child and your mother would drop you in the movies with a jar of jam and a teaspoon?
You are so cute.
Hi!
Hi Phoebe.
Hey, oh, do you know this guy following me? I spoke to him today.
You spoke to him. Are you insane?

Thank you, happy holidays.
Now, they are garbage. Girl, you can not Hey! Stop this young lady, she gave garbage!
Hey !!
Charity is on fire!
Help me!
Oh good!
Thank you, I need that.
Whoa!
What is it?!
It is nine o'clock in the morning!

Can I help you?
Uh yeah, where's the guy who decides who's going to put the pictures on the wall?
He is not here yet.
Oh, you do not care about me!
All right, make sure to tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped to drop all those clothes.
Okay?
I am an actor; I'm a little bit having my picture up on the wall.
You know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I are going to have a drink? Are you the other no?

Yes, and it really scared me! And after a while, I even tried to hurt you and it pushed you forward.
What?! You are crazy! The noises I make are not sexual!
Really?
There is nothing sexual about it?
Oooh.
Oo God!
Ohh
Ohhhh.
Ohh
What are you looking at?!
I mean hello.
Oh my-it's so embarrassing. Oh my God, I will never be massaged again!
No, you can not let this stop you from getting massages!
No look, I have a lot of customers who make the same noises as you!
Really?!
Not the customers, the lovers. But let's just try again. Come back and-and we'll work through.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I suppose.
Awesome! Ok, if you'll excuse me. So, did you hear something that you liked?

Noo !!!
Yes!
Noo !!
Yes!!
Oh no! My parents never saw me drunk! That they know.
Ok, here's the thing. We will get you coffee and they will never know that you are intoxicated.
Really?! You promise?
Yes, I'll take care of it.
Okay. I love you so much.
Okay, we have to do something about your breath.
What about
It's always up to you. Ok, now remember that this is a surprise party. So when you come in, act surprised.
Okay. I can do it.
Okay.
Surprise!!!

Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
Yes, we are done.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to see this new Imax movie about tide pools?
Really?!
No, but I have Knicks tickets for you, me and Chandler.
Sugar!
Very good, finish your coffee; Let's go.
Oh no no, not only Ross. Ross and Joey are pretty embarrassing.
In fact, sorry, I can not even get there. I see Mona tonight.
I understand: who would cancel a real date to go to a party between fake boys?
I'm sorry I have to cancel tonight baby

So it's Nancy that I know you like this one and that I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Well, uh, that one is pretty but uh, I'm coming, I love this fabric, sorry.
Oh, do not be sorry, it's part of your job here to give your opinions and I give them credit - I'm kidding.
She laughs, but never disapprove. Ok, now I'm laughing!
Oh, what a fun office.
I do not know which one, but I know I need a cigarette.
So, what are you saying, we take a break, we go out, and we'll know it when we get back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my father is a doctor and he always told me horror stories about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.

What?
Fishing core.
Yes, rabbit?
Fishing core. That night, we had ...
-Peaches?
In fact, nectarines, but basically ...
It could have been a fishery.
Then we dressed and I-I ... I accompanied her to the bus stop ... it's okay.
Hey, this woman's ass is like Carol's! What? I thought we were trying to find stuff.

Okay!
Westminster Abbey!
Without question, the best abbey I have ever seen.
Hey!
Okay.
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
I think it's great. It's good. You know, they are considering changing the name of this place.
Really? What?
To put away the camera !!!
Man,
You know, I can not believe my nails are cooked! And
Chandler, there's a guy right there.
It's a factor! It is
Chandler, do not worry! That does not make you less of a guy!
Hey, do you know who used to have nails like that?
Hmm.

Eh ... I do not know.
What?
Well, as old as his age, do not you think that Snoopy should always have the right to fly with this thing?
Rachel?
Yeah.
Do you remember when you got here, how did you spend two weeks being trained by another waitress?
Oh, of course! Do you need me to train someone new?
Good one. In fact, Terry wants you to resume training at any time.
Hey, do you think that?
Yeah?

Hey darling, you have the kind with the little girl, you said we were going to have the kind with the baby.
No, you said that the baby scares you.
No, the little girl scares me.
You said the baby.
Why would the baby kiss me?
Why would the little girl help you?
Sorry, could you speak a little more slowly, please?
This goes in your book?
Yes, it's about relationships. You know? The traps, the traps, what not to do, continues. This thing is great!
What?! Excuse me!
And how much nothing anytime people really like each other.
And how people will believe everything you tell them as it's a compliment.

Yeah!!!!
Yes I did it!
I'm on time!
Ok, why not open all our books on page 23.
Where where you will see a pile of red spots.
Okay, why not, why do not you all start reading, while I-

Yeah, okay. Okay! Keep walking! Okay?
Ross! What are you? I'm sorry sir. I just think he really likes you a lot.
Hey! Do you know this teacher who had a baby with his pupil?
What is What
Hi!
Miss? Can I help you?
Ok, listen, do not ... do not be angry, okay?
But after unpacking the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you, so I-I-I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything and then I forgot where, where he went back and I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not.
I mean, my God, Chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.
I know I have this strange thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I would never expect you to worry about it.
Really?
Of course!
Oh, you are the best. You come here for me.
Okay, wait, okay? The first thing is the first. Ok, now Ross has sat down

Ok, that's all. I can not make that decision! It is
A Magic Eight balloon ?! You can not be serious, you can not make that decision with a toy!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I do not know what else to do.
I mean, either I keep my wife and lose one of my best friends, or I keep my friend and I divorce a second time before I turn 30!
So, if anyone has a better suggestion, let's listen to it!
Because I - I have nothing!
Okay, do not be shy, any suggestion will do.
OK then.
Here we go.
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
Ask again later.
Later is not good enough.
Ask again later.
What is going on!
It's broken!
It's broken!
Okay, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Do not count on it. Looks like it works for me.

Excuse me.
Yeah?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Yeah.
Can I get your autograph, I am your biggest fan.

I think she took it very well. You know Paolo is there right now, so ...
Ah ... ooh! Well, it looks like, uh, you've been kicked in the buttocks.
No, no, she kicked us. You could be part of the Olympic team standing up.
Come on, two against one.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to dive!
And now?
Yes, it is now that you go for it!
You have to make sure that when Paolo comes out of there, the first guy Rachel will see is you, she will have to know that you are all that he is not
You are like anti-Paolo!
My Catholic friend is right.
She is helpless.
You are here for her.
You take the pieces, and then you inaugurate the age of Ross!

Well, I just called Joshua
Oh, how did it go?
Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not a crazy girl who is dying to get married - I'm going through a difficult time.
What did he say?
Well, his answering machine was
Oh, darling! Hey, I bet all he will call you back.
Yeah, maybe, but I do not even think about it.
I do not think he's the only one I'm sad for.
You know, I know I said I totally agree with Ross's wedding, but I happen to think that I do not think I'm using it that well.
Yeah maybe.
And I'm just trying to understand why.
A little bit of luck?
Well, yes, do you know how Ross and I were still on again, again and again?
I guess I just thought that somewhere on the road we would be again.
Again. You know what? I think we all did.
Hey!
I do not understand!
It was in my room all night!
And if she did not take it, and I did not take it; and you did not take it, so who did it?
Hush!
We try to think!

This is the unit for you my friend. Robust construction, tons of storage compartments, some of them big enough for an adult man.
What?!
Oh yes!
I arrived myself once.
My roommate bet me five dollars that I could not, then he stuck a board between the handles that locked me
Yeah.
It was funny until I started to feel like I was in a coffin.
No, you can not integrate with this thing. It's not deep enough.
Oh yes? If I can not, I will reduce the price of the unit by five dollars.
Okay, you have an agreement yourself.
Okay. See?! I told you!
Sometimes I come here just to get away! Hey, a nickel !!

Hey! What's up?
Hey!
Hey hey, who's your friend? Hey !!
Hey Joey!
Erin! Still there!
Yes, we ended up spending the day together and we had fun!
Why not you? Erin is great! So, there are you guys.
Ohh, listen. I have to go. Today was great, thank you!

I think I brought half of the beach back into my hair. It was so much easier when I shaved my head.
You know, I have to tell you that I'm coming
Really?!
Ohh!
Because I think of shaving everything from time to time.
Really?!
Yeah!
I mean you really should do that.
You know what, I should do it.
Yeah!
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you're so cool.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave your head!
Okay.

Oh Monica. You are not going to talk about it yet.
This woman lives my life.
What?
She lives my life and she does it better than me!
Look at this, look.
She buys tickets for coins I want to see.
She buys clothes from stores that intimidate sellers.
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You are not an artist.
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all that. Only I do not do it.
I can not believe you would say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
No way! Mr. Salty is a sailor, okay, he must be, like, the smallest snack there is.
I do not know, you do not want to play with corn nuts. They are crazazy.
Oh my God. Guys! You have to come and see that! There is a little creep there with a telescope!
I can not believe! He looks at us right!
Oh, it's so sick.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.
How can people do that? ... Oh, guys, look! The naughty naked guy has gravity boots!

It was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we have thrown this ball?
Yeah, it's amazing, it lasted so long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper here.
You know, how did I get that reputation as a dropper? Okay? I am

Hey Rach, can you give me the
Yes!
Go!!
What?!! Stop that! Stop that! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We will see you in 3 to 4 hours.
Oh!

Hey!
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Monica tells me that you do not want to play anymore because of me and my talent.
Is it true?
Well, a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.
pheebs
Ah, oh my God. Oh, honey, oh it's okay.
What. Oh no, you just rolled on the juice box.

Hey.
I have just seen a woman breastfeeding her two twins at the same time; it's like a monster here.
What's the problem?
Nothing.
What is it? Hey!
Really it's nothing. I am fair
Rach come, what?
I just thought about how my baby and I are going to be alone.
What are you talking about alone? And for Ross?
Oh please, he will be with his real family, twins and miss new breasts.
Ok, how long have I been watching this woman?
I'm just saying that you know, one day, Ross will meet someone and have his own life. Right?
Yes, I guess so.
I never thought of raising this baby alone. Pretty stupid huh?
Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What are you doing?!
I just discovered that it's Chandler's office! Go Toby, give me a hand!

Chandler, we said we would meet at the cafe at six o'clock.
We said seven!
We said six!
The only way I said six would be if the seven, meet at seven, not six.
Yes, and if I had seven, I might have said something like, "Wow, my boyfriend is such a wise teenager!
Hi!
Oh my goodness
Ugh!
I know what time you said.
What?!
In fact, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Get out of my shop!
Well, what did he do?
He went out with my wife!
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did
This is my wife !!! Get out!
Well, we should go there.
Yeah.

You know, you really did not have to take me to the airport.
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.
You know?
In addition, someone had to take the rest of your luggage in this other taxi and your friends do not seem to care too much about your departure.
Well, we're really not that close. Ok, so I guess it's a goodbye then.
On no! No! It's not goodbye, I will not leave until you take this plane.
No, I'm afraid I can not make love as well as him.
Yes, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the real words.
So, Joey had a lot of girlfriends, that does not mean he's good in bed.
We share a wall! So either he's good in bed, or she just likes to agree with him.
Honey, with you it's going to be different. Sex is going to be great, because you are in love.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Go ahead, Chandler.
Yeah, you should.
Yeah, you really should.
Keep on going.
Okay, alright, I'm going to sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.

: I'm sure in the hell of a dancer, it's not worth Marge never defend me.
Go Treeger, do not say that.
You just need more practice.
Come on, come on, let's try again.
Come on.
Besides, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
I mean, you know, I'm not really comfortable dancing with a- We do!
Hey!
: Yeah!

Oh me
Are you sure? I bet there is another flight to Minsk as
July. Umm,
It is really nice. What does it mean?
Please, clean my cups. I do not leave the lab much.
Its good. I must admit that I thought it was something else.
Yeah, I really meant that, but I thought I probably should not, because I have to leave.
You are right! You are right. Do not say it.
I-I do however.
Me too.
Goodbye Phoebe.
Ok, this is not the moment Joey. Okay? You can shout at me tomorrow.
I know.
Oh-oh, wait, did you hear that?
Look, I'm going to get something from your grandmother, she said that since you're keeping the one-bedroom apartment, you should give Rachel the purple chair?
No, I do not hear that.

Yes, I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh that's great!
Yeah! Yeah!
I can not believe you're getting married!
Yeah.
Monica and Rachel are out.

Ohhh!
Why are we in bed together?
I do not know. Do you have clothes?
Yeah.
Really?!
No!
But we did not have sex, right?
I mean, I do not remember much of last night, it was so vague.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
And we did not have sex.
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we did not do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.

What are we going to do?
I say we're going with
Chandler?
Has she ever seen us? Did she see us?
Janice, what are you doing here?
What is this smell?
I know!

Hi, do you remember us?
Um okay. A few moments ago, you just called to request a signature on the admission form. Well, it turns out we need a
I am. I am
Yes, and I will pay for it with a check.
Yeah, I know ... I'm not that brilliant either.

Hey, Monday, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which of these two do you want to wear?
You know what? he
Sorry.
I am so excited!
I've been waiting for months!
I have colored hair!
I have new leaves!
I make him a
Um-hmm.
What do I do to him?
Well, you make him a curly salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild walnuts, wild rice, grilled asparagus and crusted salmon.
I thought I was filleting him?
Yes, you did, but you decided to make salmon because you had left in the restaurant.
And then you realized that if you did not care, you would stop cooking and you had to prepare your famous baked potato and your Coca-Cola.
Wow, I get really sad when I cook.

Chandler! This happens to a lot of guys! You probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, do not worry about that!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated.
You know, it's like, uh, biology!
Which is funny because in high school I failed in biology and tonight biology failed me.
Check it out. Okay, I can play that when the guests arrive. Okay.
Phoebe!
If you'd let me finish, we'll say he's probably not gay.

You fall deeply asleep.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
You are now completely asleep.
You do not need to smoke.
Cigarettes do not control you.
You are a strong and confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
A strong and confident woman.
Thank you for your patience, you are the next interlocutor.
Yes!! Yes!! I am the next caller! You were going to hang me up.
Hey! Can you take a duck and a girl at the theater?
Of course not.
No.
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from someone else.

So, how's it going with Paul?
Well.
Although you know, he's a private man.
You know, I wish I could convince him to open up a little, to share feelings.
It's easy! You must just think of him as a jar of pickles that does not open.
So, what are you saying; Should I run it under hot water and bang my head against a table?
No, that's what you do when you want to get someone's truth.
Hello Darling.
Hi!

Ok, Ben, I will not tell your father that you ate ice cream for dinner, if you do not talk about our little bonk incident.
Monica, number one, I do not think Ben understands the concept of corruption, and number two, I ... What ?!
You said number two.
I also said number one.
Remind me to check with you which pot is decaffeinated and which is regular.
I can not just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
Ok, okay.
Gunther, what do you know? I am a terrible waitress. Do you know why I am a terrible waitress?
Because I do not care.
I do not care.
I do not care what pot is regular and which pot is decaffeinated, no matter where the tray is, I do not care, it's not what I want to do.
So, I do not think I should do it anymore.
I will give you my weeks notice.
What?!
Gunther, I stopped.
Does this mean that we will have to start paying for coffee?

Oh, I mean it's so realistic!
I know. Yes, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I understood!!
Are you ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably should not, so I'll do it! Oh! Wow! It's like raining!
Pretty cool, huh?
But if you think you can put a fish on it and it will not be sucked in by the mechanism, you would be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right here.
Okay. My God, if someone told me a week ago that I would pee in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
Yes, life is beautiful, is not it?
Yes it's sure!

You know, I think I was sixteen.
Please, just a little bit in the back.
I am always on "no".
Uh, in the morning. Do you think you could close your eyes for a second?
No-no-no-no-no, I did not fall for that yet.
What is going on?
Well, I sort of did a stupid thing last night.
What stupidity did you make?
Ewww!

I know.
See, yes.
It's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick.
I love you both.
But in very different ways.
Hey!
Hey!
(sees that he looks
I did! But the store would not take it back! So I took her to the shelter and you know what I discovered?
If they can not find her a house, they kill her! And I will not let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay, well, well, well, because, well, because I had a little bit of doubt too.
Okay. And it's not just chicks you know? It's all kinds of other animals!
It's horrible! Well, you made the right choice, man.
Thank you, I'm glad you see it like that.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!

So Chandler, did you hear about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Well yes. She uh, she, uh, she might have talked about him.
So Monday, when are we going to meet this new secret server?
Ohh, he's really shy. I do not think he's ready to meet everyone.
Yes, I do not think he's ready to meet everyone.
I do not care! I want to meet this guy who is the best sex she has ever had!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
I may have said that. Why is it funny?
Because I am very happy for him! And
Hi!
Okay, well, I just can not think about it right now. I just want to say goodbye to my grandmother.
Okay.
Okay, let's say goodbye.

Hey!
Did you have all these things for Joey to try to get me out of the apartment?
Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well make him a fish, you know how much the fish made me flipper!
Fish!
In any case, it would not matter, Phoebe, you and I are going to live together, we are roommates; it's the deal.
Yes, but I wanted you to live with me, but okay, if you're having such fun here
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
We had a lot of fun, did not we?
We were doing!
Oh, anyway, they say, if you want, we can see it tonight.
Oh, I'd like to
Yes OK!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Great, all right, all right, and Monica asks me to stop the drums.
Uh ... Done!

You do not pay for pizza!
Oh come on, that's right, you paid for the theft. Now, is it enough?
Ahh, I'll throw a thousand more on it.
Why, how much?
It's about 60 cents.
Ok, it's coffee.
Iced coffee? Tell me it's iced coffee!
It's hot
Hot coffee!!!
You idiot !!
You were going to pour hot coffee on me, huh? !!
What are you just a big idiot, idiot, idiot, with a silly hairstyle, huh?
Huh?
!
What is your favorite thing in the summer?
Umm, go to the beach. When it is very late day.
Yeah
Hey!
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favorite thing in the summer?
Ooh, I do not know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Ohh, it's a good one.

OK, try this salmon mousse.
Mmmm. Well.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It's creamier.
Yeah
I do not know. We are talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy to keep it, see?
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests ... and what do I learn?
"You are perfectly suited to a career in data processing for a large multinational."
It's so fantastic! Because you already know how to do that!
Can you believe it? I mean, do not I look like someone who should be doing something really
Oh Chandler, I know, I know ... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
That's it, maybe it'll cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better share that with you.

I thought it was going to be a closed coffin.
That does not mean she can not look pretty!
Honey, do you think you can go?
I do not see why not.
Here is my mandate!

Someone there?
No, it's just part of a daring game that I play called 'Wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Jeez, man you fell .. Hi! So, uh, did you fall high?
Someone was in the woman's room, I could not wait. I left the lid for you though.
You know what Gunther, go ahead ah, go ahead, I-I'm talking to ah ,. This is the part where you say your name.
Ginger.
Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so ...
You do not have to use the bathroom?
No, no, I'd just like, I'd rather talk to you.
Yes.
Yes, I have to go to the bathroom.
Someone here.

I will continue to go to his mother, and you can not do anything about it!
Oh yes there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles ?!
It was an accident! And you too.
At least I'm not a murderer!
Oh my baby!
It was a great scene! And-and-this slap looks so real! How are you doing that?
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I have ice cream here ?!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how great I think you are.
You are not the fan who dies, are you?
Can you repeat that please?
I am supposed to meet and kiss a fan who is dying, but it is supposed to be that later!
No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in a coma!
Oh, was she a real person ?!
Anyway, I ... I just wanted to say that since I have your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there are any tips you can give me.
I-I-I leave the series?
I do not know. Why? Did you hear anything?
Who told you that?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Which? Was he bald or was he tall?
Umm

To feel better?
Yeah!
A lot!
Listen, not that I'm uncomfortable with my manhood or anything else, but I think I need to meet a woman like now.
Yes I understand.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Hi!
You know, you look familiar. Have I ever seen you somewhere?
I do not think so.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on TV. I'm an actor
Wow!
Yeah.
Really?!
Hm-mmm.
$ 4.50 please.
Oh, let me understand that. These are for you.

Okay, okay, okay.
It's been fourteen minutes and a half and you still have not said a word.
Oh my God, do something.
Just make contact, smile!
Here!
You're really scared here.
Do you want to call someone?
Yes, about 300 guys with whom I went to high school.

Okay! Do not hesitate to look, but I tell you that these contracts are not on this desk.
Oh
It's my sister.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway you know what, the
So, when do you imagine that you gave them to me? The morning or afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a

Phoebe, she does not know you sneak out every night, she does not know you sneak in every morning and she does not know you live with your grandmother for a week now.
Ok, maybe not at these levels.
Hey.
Hey.
I will never find a roommate, ever.
Why, nobody good?
Well, let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, it's plural.
The spitter.
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy who liked my name so much that he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.
Delighted, Chandler Bing
So how much do you have tomorrow?
Two.
This photographer, who seemed really dull.
And this type of actor, of which I am not sure, because when he called and I answered the phone "Chandler Bing", he said "Whoa-whoa, short message".
Ross, one foot on the ground or do not come anymore!
Of course, your dresser is gone but she notices it.
What?
I have to go. Yes, Carol should be home now, so ...
Uh, how are you guys doing?
Oh, better, actually. You know, I-I-I think I finally understood why we had so many problems lately.
Oh really?
Yeah, you know how I got you, well, she does not really have any close friends who are only hers, but last week she met this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they got really well done it's going to make a difference

Hey!
Hi!
What is it, what is it?
Oh, just a few pictures I made and hung up. I thought they would brighten up the place. They do not you think?
No no no no!
How's it going?
It's like that.
It's crazy.
It may be crazy in a perfect world, a world without blouses, but not in a perfect world, but in a museum now.
Seeing this scientist in class, he and I used to play together all the time in elementary school, but now Peter!
Hey, Peter!
It's me Rhonda!
PS-129!
I shared my puddin 'that you dude!
I gave you my
I-I think everyone pretends not to hear you.
Be that as it may, I do not know about you, your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends. If I keep him a place, I tell you, he
It's good, I'm cool here. I'll catch you later, Joey.
Op, it's saved. Souvenir shop.

How is this coffee?
Yes, right now Mr. Kaplan.
I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me disgusting.
I know!
I bet you think, "What is a smart girl who wants to be fashionable, who makes coffee?" Huh?
Op.
Eh.
Oh, you got me.
Well, do not think I did not notice your potential.
Well, I have a project for you that is much more fashionable.
How does it sound?
Oh, that sounds good.
Come here, darling.
Oh thank you very much, Mr. Kaplan, thank you very much.
Well, I know, I was just, uh, I was just thinking and hoping that, uh, maybe you'd like to get back together?
No, but thank you.
Oh, come Phoebe, do not you think?
Okay. No, but thank you.
Ok, to more Pheebs.
Wow, it was a bit brutal.
Okay, let this be a lesson for all of you, okay.
Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, you know.
Very cold, hard, inflexible, you know nothing,
Yes of course.

Sensational.
I am really sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry too. But I must tell you that I am a little relieved.
Relieved?
Yeah, well, I had a good time with you ... I can not stand your friends.

She wants
Oh my God! If you say that one more time,
Well!
Well!
But this breakup is not entirely my fault, and she, she says here, "If you accept full responsibility ..." Full responsibility!
'... I can start trusting you again.
Does this seem to be something you can do?
Does he do it?
! '
No?
Listen, Ross, you got what you want, you're back with Rachel.
If you talk about it now, you will destroy the best thing that has happened to you.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, no, you're right.
Yes I guess I will give up.
But do you understand how difficult it is to forget that.
Of course, it's hard to forget!
But that does not mean you have to talk about it!
During this trip, many things happened that we should never, ever speak.
What happened on this beach ?!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!

I did not think you were gay. I'm doing it now.
See my friend, my friend Rachel, she wants to be installed.
Ah, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for anything serious.
Oh, you know what, it could go even if it was just an adventure, it could go for Rachel.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is it, Rachel hot, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, that's his full name.
Oh wow! I am free for her!
Oh, wait a second! I did not say that I was not free!
Hey, Chandler, why do not we talk to the Rangers game tomorrow?
Wait, you know I
Oh well, it's a little later than me, I usually want to stay, but of course!
Maybe before the match, we could enjoy eight-year-old Basel Hadens, eight years old.
Well, I do not really know what it is, but

Monica, let's go. Go now people, woman in work.
Hey Ross, look what I have to do here.
Yes, keep that for the taxi, okay.
What are you doing? We go to the hospital.
What, then I can not be nice? There could be doctors there.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
Alright Alright.
What is it?
For the journey.
Yes, like in a taxi ...
Save it.
Ok, I hate that.
Monica, come now. Come on, baby coming.
I can not believe it, I'm going to be an aunt. I will have as a nephew.
It's good. Go out, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm going there. I go.
We go, we go
Rossy, Rossy.

WHAT IS IT?!
Ok, I-I know, do you come-you have a quality.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a good quality, because I was afraid you'd be vague about it.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh my God! Call from Rome!
So he calls from Rome. I could do that. I just have to go to Rome.
Monica, your father just beeped, but can you hurry? Speak to Rome I speak in Rome.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh my God. Ross, it's Nana.

So, uh, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
Oh, all right, I need a divorce.
Oh yes, of course. We live in the building near the sidewalk.
You know?
Hey, listen, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we get together for a drink?
Oh, of course, they love us there.
Ben! Ben! Ben!

Give me!
No! They are mine!
You stole them!
You stole them from me !!
Give me!
You just want to take one?
Yes, that seems right. We never use them.
Listen, I really need help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak with a British accent ?! What do I do?
well
Why do not you eliminate it?
Yeah, dim the accent and people will think that you are adapting to life in America.
Yeah, I mean, come on, Ross, nobody will even notice it. I mean they probably do not even listen!
They do not listen to me too much?
Of course, they listen to you! Everyone is listening to you.
Monica, do you really think I should try this solution?
I think you look good.

Why not Joey ... Pepponi?
No, always too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a more neutral name.
Joey ... Switzerland?
Besides, you know, I think it should be Joe.
You know, Joey gives me the impression that I am, I do not know, that fat man.
What I am not.
Joe ... Joe ... Joe ... Stalin?
Stalin ... Stalin ... Do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Well, it does not tell me anything.
Joe Stalin. You know, that's fine.
I might want to try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin. I think you will remember!
Oh yes! Goodbye Birdie, with Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the fiddler on the roof.

Are you kidding?
Ok, look.
I studied evolution.
Remember, evolution?
Monkey in the man?
Besides, I'm a doctor and I had a monkey.
I am a monkey doctor!
I do not argue with that.
Okay, I've heard enough. I took my decision.
You are both idiots.
The joke is not funny, and it shocks women, doctors and monkeys!
You should not argue over who has a credit, but who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke on the world!
Now give up!
The joke fears!
It's your joke.
Is not.

Hi everyone, Rachel was so good today. She did not chat at all.
I do not have!
Even when I discovered it, all right, let's say I found something about someone and just say she's going to keep it.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ooh, you nailed the old lady!
Yeah listen so I thought I was getting better, so when I got home today, I stopped at
Do you have, do you have
No.
Give me your hands. Cordes. Give me! To choose. Do you want to learn how to play the guitar?
Yes!
So do not touch one !!
Really? Would you do that for me ?!
Yeah!
Thank you!
Okay, let's start slowly. The only thing you have to do tonight is find the name of your main character.
Completed!
And it can not be Joey.
It's not.
Or Joseph.
Oh.

Hi!
Hi! Hey, Pete, you're back! Hey, look at this.
Wow! Skates!
Wow! You're a lot stronger than Chandler. He collapsed like a piece of paper. So how was your trip?
Well...
Oh, what did you bring me ?!
Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
Oh, it's going to go in my permanent collection.
You want a coffee?
Yeah, sure, that would be great.
Regular or decaffeinated?
Ah, who is always the closest.
Okay.
So ask me what I did today.
So what did you do today, Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the chef.
What?! Oh.

Hi.
Hey.
Where were you?
To the vet.
She's not going to get you one of those big plastic cones, right?
She says that Marcel's thing is not a phase. Apparently, he has reached sexual maturity.
Hey! He beat you.
She says that with time, he will become aggressive and violent.
What does that mean?
I will have to give it up.

AWW MEC! I can not believe I locked myself in again!
Wait for my friend!
Oh my God! What happened here? Have you done all this?
Of course I did it.
But we have not seen each other since then. Well, I'm coming to China, guess who's responsible for the search.
Julie! Julie, it's not great? I mean, is not it just a crotch kick, a fantastic pin on your neck?

May I come in?
Uh, yes, if you want too.
Make
Yes of course?
Me too.
Ok, Rachel, before something happens, I just want to set some basic rules.
It's about tonight.
I will not go through if it raises the question of "We".
Okay?
I just want it to be about what it is!
And uh, what is it that Ross?
The physical act of love.
What?! Are you insane?
Oh, so you were not trying to attract me with your nakedness?
Oh my God, did you see me ?! Oh!
You were not trying to attract me with your nakedness.
Noo !! No! You thought, did you really think I wanted to sleep with you ?!
No! No! No! No no no no.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross, you took off your shoes!
Have you just spent time with Ross?
It's perfect! Ok goodbye Monday! She will kill me.
Yes, the phone was in front. And it goes up there.

Ah Joey.
Joey Tribbiani.
Listen Joey, I have a problem, my dance captain called me, he has a relational crisis and can not leave Long Island.
So, does that mean that the hearing is off?
Look, Joey, since you have the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
What?!
Oh come on Joey, it's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand, head, head, head, no stuff, no stuff, big bend here, big sissone, sissone, sissone, slide your fingers back!
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Enjoy.
Goodbye.

Wow! Fortunately she has a
Oh, I can not believe it! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Oh, I can not believe that my sperm has a low motility because, let me tell you, when I grew up, they seem really in a hurry to win places!
!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry, there was no better news from your test last week, but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
Okay.
Above all, even if your chances of conceiving by natural means are not great, you never know!
So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
Oh, damn it!
Do not worry, after a while he will fix the problem.
Ok, considering your situation, the options offering the best chance of success would be surrogacy, or insemination with the help of a sperm donor.
Okay.
You know, monogamy can be a complicated concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Well. Okay, now you will never know.
We laugh. Come on, tell us!
Yeah! Let's go there!
Well. There is a theory, put forward by Richard Leakey-

Hi, is Carol here?
No, she's at a teachers' meeting.
Oh, I just came to take my skull. Well, not mine, but ...
Come in.
Thank you. Yes, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to take it back to the museum.
What does it look like?
A bit like a big face without skin.
Yes, I know the concept. We can simply search for it.
Okay. Wow, you probably have a lot of books about being lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a class. Otherwise, they will not let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the turtle. A classic.
In fact, I read it to the baby.
The baby who is not yet born? Does not that mean you're ... crazy?
What, do not you think they can hear sounds?
You're not serious, I mean, you're really ... you really talk about it?
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up dude?
I am trppd ... in a cash machine vstbl ... wth
Oh my God! He's stuck in an ATM lobby with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yeah, as this thought never entered my mind.

and it was all before 10 o'clock.
The caterer rang and said it would be Kiev chicken instead of tarragon chicken.
And then the florist phoned to say there were no tulips.
Oh, and the most chilly has the carpel-tunel syndrome.
We are not going to be
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
Well, yours too!

Where is Chandler?
Ah, he can not do it, he said he had his ... Whoa-oh!
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey, can I see you ok? You hide behind the coats.
Ok, listen, give me everything I can do.
Well, if you have nothing to copy, why are you going there?
Yeah, are you just going down there to see that sexy girl with the navel ring again?
Yeah! You want to come?
Yeah!

Well.
Well.
Well.
Well.
Okay. We will go there. It's not until six o'clock. We will go then.

Hey.
What's the problem?
Someone in the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck !!
Oh Willie is still alive!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, my mother called, they will post our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we look for a good picture of ourselves.
Oooh, I'm afraid it does not exist.
That's not true, there are some great pictures of us!
No, there are some great pictures of you standing next to a guy who goes like this
Oh my God! It's the creep that you are with the
I do not know what it is, I just can not take a good picture.
Oh, here is an excellent one.
Yes, I'm not in this.
I know, but look at me: all tanned.
Why are not you going to have portraits done by a professional photographer?
It's a good idea! I bet they have one of these wind turbines! You know
Yes it's great! Beside that, Chandler will not look so stupid.
Chandler, what are you saying?
Okay, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I go.
