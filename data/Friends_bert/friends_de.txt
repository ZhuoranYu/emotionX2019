I know.
I, too, was the deciding factor in moving my company from the KL-5 to the GR-6 system.
You must have your hands full.
I did this. I did this.
Let's talk a bit about your duties.
My tasks? Well.
Now you will lead a whole department, so you will have a lot of duties.
Aha.
But there may be 30 people under you so you can throw a certain amount on them.
Good to know.
We can go into detail
No, I do not ask you!
Okay, then we have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence that you'll be fine here.
Really?!
Absolute. You can relax; You did well.
But who? The waitress I went out with last month?
You know? Forget it!
No no no no no! Who, from whom do you speak?
No, I-II-I-don't know
OK!
Alright, well ...
I'll see if I can get a room for the night and I'll ...
See you later!
Yes sure!

Hey, Monday
Hey Hey Hey. You want to hear something that is shit.
Have I ever.
Chris says they close the bar.
Under no circumstance!
Yes, apparently they make a coffee out of it.
Only coffee! Where will we hang out now?
Got me.
Can I get a beer?
Hey, did you choose a roommate?
You can bet on it!
Is it the Italian?
Um-mm, yes right!
Oh my god oh my god! Poor Monica!
What what what?!
What?!
He was with her when he wrote this poem.
Look, "My jar is so empty with nothing in it.
Now that I've touched you, you seem to be even emptier.
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Do you really think he meant that?
Oh, totally. Oh god, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Done.

Hello!
Hello!
What are you doing here?
You know, this building is on my paper path, so ...
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
How did it go?
Well, the woman I was interviewing was pretty tough, but thankfully, thank you, that Mark trained me, because when I started talking about the fall line, she was happy and did not want to shut up.
I'm so proud of you.
Me too!
Listen, it's me, I'm sorry that I was so crazy and jealous and it's just that I really like you, so ...
I know.
Yes.
Yes.
American.
Americcan.
American. You know, it's one
Everyone!!

Good job Joe! Well done! First class, top notch!
You liked it? You really liked it?
Oh-ho-ho, yes!
Which part exactly?
The whole thing! Can we go?
Oh no, no, give me some details.
I love the peculiarities, the peculiarities were the best part!
Hey, what about the kangaroo scene? Did you like this part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War II epic.
You fell asleep!!
There was no kangaroo!
You have not made any of my suggestions!
That's for buddy coming.
See you later.
Do not go!
I'm so sorry.
I am sorry!
Appearance!
This guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too!
Be mad at him!
Or call an ambulance.

Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she screwed up her dessert.
What?! What about everyone? It's Thanksgiving, not ... truth day!
Yes, and it is my last wish to have this ring.
See, if I'm not buried with this ring, my mind will wander forever in the underworld
Okay, that's enough honey!
I dont know. Let me see the ring.
Great! Okay, here.
Well.
Many Thanks. Many Thanks. Many Thanks! And

What did you do?
Oh, you know, the usual, aerobics class, too much party.
Oh, and if you're wondering, these are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you hold on for a moment? I have another call. I love her.
I know.
I'm back.
So, will we get together or what?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how about tomorrow afternoon? Do you know, Central Perk in the village, say five?
Great, see you then.
OK. OK. A telephone has finally paid off.
Although you make a good bob impression, I think if she sees you tomorrow, she'll probably realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
I hope Bob, if he does not appear, will seek comfort in the open arms of the dry stranger at the next table.
Oh dear God. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I did that

Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You would not believe what people put in here!
Appearance!
Okay, does that look like a garbage can to you?
No.
This is my wedding.
Alright, you know what? We are really late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
Fine. You'll watch it on video when we get back.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Many Thanks.
Many Thanks.
Ok, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
Bye, Pheebs!
London baby !!
Oh, do you need a hug? You do not have to bring me anything!

Hello!
Hello! So Estelle has arranged a series of castings for me tomorrow and I will have my health insurance back in no time.
That's great, but should not you be in the bathroom right now?
What?!
What's wrong with you?
Nothing!
Well, I - I had that blinding pain in my stomach when I raised weights before, then I fainted and uh, I could not get up since then.
But I do not think it's serious.
That sounds like a hernia. You have to go to-you-you doctor!
Under no circumstance! "Kay, if I have to go to the doctor for something, it will stick out of my stomach for this thing!
That's a hernia.
Why did I have to start training again? Damn, you're 15s!

I love your place! Where does this guy come from?
This is an 18th-century Indian artefact from Calcutta.
Oh wow! So, you are more than just dinosaurs.
So much more.
Well, to sum it up, we have fun, you look young.
OK
But that's not enough. So, here is a key to my apartment.
Really?!
Really.
You do not think that's too fast.

Go out!
Ross, can I talk to you shortly?
Yes, please! So what's up?
Um, well ... Joey and I broke up.
Oh my god, what happened?
Joey is a great guy, but we're just ... so different! I mean, during your speech he always laughed at Homo erectus!
I knew it was him!
Anyway, I think it's the best.
Hey, are you ok?
I guess.
There was a humming ... there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
I began to realize that I had feelings for someone else.
Ok geller. On the last day of the conference, you know what's going on with the main speaker.
Oh, Professor Clerk, we're in the middle of a conversation here.
Yes, can you just throw it in the pool later?
Or we could throw you both in it
Ok, gentlemen!
You're welcome!
Are not we a little bit old for that?
I mean, we're scientists, right?
We are academics.
And especially me ... you - you have to catch us first.
,
GEH! GEH! GEH!

Go! Go! Go!
Oh yes, everyone wants to be under this hat!
Oy !!
What about all the sand?
Oh yes, Bob said there could be flood damage.
Yes, either, or he has a really big cat.

Okay, do you see the blind guy there? I'll beat him in the head later.
Oh, um, my big scene is coming up. Great scene comes up.
When you said, "Big lima bean, bubbly." Would she understand the difference?
Rach? What do you do?
Oh boy, I just can not watch. It's too scary!
It's a diaper commercial.
Oh yes, you know me, babies, responsibility, ahhh !!!
Pizza delivery service!
I will get it! I will get that!
Hello!
Hello!
Hey, do you want to eat something or do you want to see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uhh, the ball thing.
Yes?
Hey Ross, would not it be great if we could go for two hours without a break ?!
Uh,
OK!
Oh oh.
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel is in the bathroom!
Man, I did not think we would do it!
I know! Do not change hands, okay?

Hello.
Hello!
How did Erin go?
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Yay !! Oh, are not you, you're not mad at us anymore?
No!
No!
No!
You are absolutely right!
This is so much better than the first time we went out.
You know?
That was so embarrassing, we were really nervous.
Did not you sleep together?
Yes, that really calms me down.
And!
We have so much in common!
She loves sandwiches, sports, even though she's a Met fan, not a big problem now, but if we ever had children then that's one
Oh dear God! Listen to you talking about having children. Oh my Joey. Oh, please do not marry before I do.
OK.

How does she do that?
I can not sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Oh! What what what! ...Hello.
It's okay, you know, you just go back to sleep.
What's wrong with you?
I did not sleep last night!
Why?
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and both are unsure in bed.
Oh, and deaf.
So they always have to assure each other that they are having fun.
You have no idea how loud they are!
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Many Thanks.
Ew! What's this? Something exploded!
It's just their water break. Calm down, right?
Water breaking, what do you mean? What is it, water breaks?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

Are you crazy? I mean Joey, I'm going to kill you, he's really going to kill you.
OK! You do not believe that I thought of it?
How can you not know which?
I mean, that's incredible.
I mean, was it Gina?
Who is Gina?
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
No, no, that's Dina.
You see, you can not say which one is, dwha !!
I do not know, you thought "Until Saturday" was funny.
Look, darling, Mark is in fashion, okay, I like having a friend I can share this stuff with.
You never want to go to a lecture with me.
Pa-haa !! I would like to go with you.
Really!?
Yes, I am - I have clothes, I even select them.
I mean, for all you know, I could be a fashion ..... Monger.
OK. Darling, I would love it if you would go with me. What?
What should I wear, now I am very nervous.

: I know, we did it !! Hey, that was incredible, right?
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
: Thank you, listen, thank you Tribbani ,. Oh my god, look at the time, I have to catch the bus to the ball.
Alright, okay, good luck.
: Yes.
Unless you want to practice the foxtrot again? Or - or the tango?
: Ahh, thanks no. You see, I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
OK.
: Yes.
Go and get Treeger.
: Law. Hey, ahh, do you want to come along? Marge has a girlfriend.
"Really?"
: Yes, you can dance really well with her, she is just as tall as me.
No, I'm fine.

Oh god, that's so nerve-racking! How - how do you do that?
Well, unfortunately I do not get many callbacks
Is it a good sign that they have asked us to hang around after the audition?
Who knows?
Okay, we limited it to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey. The rest of you, thank you.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye! So long! Later!
Oh that's great! I could actually play Ben's dad!
Yes!
Actually, that can not happen.
Yes, because you all have such different looks, we put you together with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
So you will be either you or two.
Man, it's gonna be weird.
Yes, it is.
No, we - we will be like best friends, so it will be weird.

Okay, come on, I can not marry until I get something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.
Okay, all right, all right! OK! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
You're welcome!
Are you kidding?
I - I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose - I mean - I'm not proud of it, but it's me really.
And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
I think you have a concussion.
No I'm serious. Many Thanks.
You're welcome. I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?
It's worth the pain. Do you know what, you know what? It is not.

Impressive! The Mike thing was interesting! I do not know what will happen to Phoebe and David.
I do! Do you want a hint? not true? "I'll do it".
Okay, I feel that this is some kind of pun, because you are pink with barely controlled joy.
David will suggest Phoebe.
What? Why?
Because we talked about how he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to marry.
Chandler, we talked about it.
They should not give people any advice!
Could not you just have made an inappropriate joke?
I
They've only been on the road for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely done with Mike!
She will say no, David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for her to recover and then Phoebe will end up alone
Man, that's a few
Oh, that's not what you want ...

This is my dad, Paul Stevens. Dad, that's Ross Geller.
It's great to meet you, Paul.
I usually prefer Elizabeth's friends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Of course, Mr. Stevens.
So Ross, what's your problem?
Eh-w-excuse?
Why can not you get a girlfriend your age?
This is funny. Umm. It is not funny.
I
OK.
I can, I can see that.
Umm, but I think if you give me a chance, I can change your mind.
OK.
What?
OK. I give you a chance to change my mind. You have one minute.
Dad!
Well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, well, I'll bring you a cassette, right?
So, do you have any of Matt Laurer's clothes now? Could be? Only those who have not been cleaned yet?

Ooooohh!
Oh yes, I'm sure. And suddenly his hands were no longer the problem.
Was it...?
Oh, Boy Scouts could have camped down there.
"Ooo," what?
Uma Thurman.
Oh!
The actress!
Thanks Rach.
So what will you do?
You have to tell her!
You have to tell her!
It is your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it is a feminist topic!
Guys?
Guys?
Oh, yes, you have to tell her.
Feminist question. I went there!
She will hate me.
Oh well...

Will you marry me?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Yes, do you have the ring?
Yes, right here in my bag. Pheebs?
Oh! Oop!
Okay, will you get out of here now? I want this to be a surprise and she will know.
Yes, people. Get out!
Hi Guys.
You are beautiful.
Oh thank you! What's happening?
We are really excited about this charity event we have to go to.

Okay, um, Ross?
I'm really warm, so I take off my sweater.
Well, I just let you know that this is so
Yes! That's hilarious!
I'm so sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
You know, last night you were embarrassed too.
No not true. I mean, you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
OK. Alright, that's right! But you know, I just do not embarrass that.
What?! You are totally ashamed!
No, I do not! Ross, I think I'm only a safer person than you.
Is that so?
Yes.
Hello lady! I do not care how much you want! OK?! I am

I can not believe it!
I did it!
I rode a bike!
I never thought I would do it!
Thanks Ross.
Oh hey, do not thank me, thank you. You are the one who has faced their fears and ultimately overcome them.
Well, but then
Yes-No-but-but-but-but! We just go home and take a shower. Well, that's not scary, right?
Depends on what you mean by us.

Hey, you two should be up there with me.
I mean, you two are - I mean mine, I'm happy to have only one good one
Thanks man.
I have to check something here.
What a baby.
Total knowledge!

David?
Phoebe! Hello!
Oh dear God!
Wow, you look amazing.
Yes. What - what are you doing here?
Well, I'm back from Minsk ... in the long run.
What happened?
Now, do you remember how I tried to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Yes?
Well, after eight years of research, I realized that this is not possible.
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
Good, good, life is good ...
Well!
Ah, I - I see someone.
Oh good for you.
She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and ... well, it's really because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike and I just said " Boy, I want that ".
Mike and I separated.
It means we can keep trying, but there is a good chance that this will never happen to us.
Oh dear God!
I'm so sorry.
I am sorry, too.
Well, we will ... we will find out.
I know.

Okay, we have many options here, a series of prototypes that you can try.
Impressive! That looks good!
Yes! Okay, this is a mushroom cap. Um, this one is from Bologna.
And-and-and-and-and-toothpicks?
You kissed another woman!
Do you even call it?!
OK!
Well, I'll get this in some water.
Wait, you stole those from the wedding of these people?
No, no, I took her out of the hotel lobby.
Yes, they think they can charge me for a dirty movie and a bag of mashug nuts.
Hello!
My sweater!
I have been searching for this for a month!
Oh dear God!!
Oh dear God!

Happy?! Should I be the Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you should be?
Huh?
Because I can not fucking find out!
I talk to you and nothing.
You look at me, and it's nothing.
Nothing.
Delicious! I'm starting to think that you have a story, it's - it's beautiful.
I have a question about this scene.
Yes?
Well, I do not understand why Adrienne is attracted to Victor.
Peel the onion. First of all, he looks good.
Yes.
I think my character will need a little more reason than that.
Oh, hey, how about this.
Ah, that's the script!
You know, ah, I do not know why my character likes you, I mean, it's written here that you're a bitch.
This is not in the script.
It does in my!

I can not
Yes! You have to tell a girl before you hold her. Such a rookie mistake.
Do you know who has a great video camera?
Greg and Jenny?
Do you still want to call her? I want to call her.
Let's call her.
Yes! Ask them if they have brought souvenirs to their friends!
Hello? Eighth street deli?
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning if you just talk to this place.
I'm sorry, wrong number.
May I help you.
Hello? It's the deli again!
Well! I will have a sandwich!
I do not think that number is right!
Oh come on !!

Must go. I miss you too, I love you, but now it's getting late
Hello mum. Listen, I have the appointment with Dr. Ing. Bazida met, and ... sorry? Did you know that this is not Ma?
Her name is Ronni. She is a pet undertaker.
For sure. How long have you been ...
Do you remember when you were a little kid, did I always bring you to the Marine Yard and show you the big ships?
Since then?!
No, it's only six years.
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you know I was not always such a dreadful guy.
... Joe.
Were you in love?
... I know it.
Then hey not. You burn your tomatoes.
You are one of the people to talk to.
Joe, your dad is in love. And worst of all, it's with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me one of them is Ma.
Of course, one of them is Ma. What's wrong with you.

Everything will be fine. Okay, Dick?
Hello, I am Guru Saj - Whoa !! That's supposed to be a duck, right? Because otherwise, that's waaay from my league.
Hey, Rach, how was the work?
Oh cool. Although I sat down where no chair was.
By the way, Ross has found a box of your things.
Oh, well, I think I had it with me.
I'll just throw it away, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and ...
There is something wrong?
No nothing.

And then, and then you said that, about the Mesozoic in the 21st century.
Yes that's it?
Yes.
Yes !!
We are teeth people Zack!

Dude, I'm sorry for what I said!
No, you're right, it's a ridiculous name!
It's not that bad.
Yes it is! From now on I do not have a first name anymore.
So, you're just Bing?
Because we have recovered our apartment!
What? Ace is high! Jack, Queen, King, Ace!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I dont know. Oh! Oh! Look at it! Ah-ha!
All right, cut, let's peck again, peck again.
OK.
Come apartment! Come apartment! Oh! I know that Queen is tall!
Uh-huh, not as high as it worked! King!
Yes baby!
But we pick up again! We pick up again!
Why?!
I dont know!
Tickets, please! This is a courtside baby!
Seriously, good game. Good game. What are they so angry about? You get the apartment back!
No, they do not have!

You know, I do not think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to grab the baby's anvil?
It will be worth it.
It is a known fact that women love babies, alright?
Women love men who love babies.
It's all this sensitive thing.
Quick, aim for this pack of babes over there.
Maybe one of them will break out.
No, no, wait until we get them, we have one, hard left.
Okay, give me the baby.
No, I have it.
No seriously.
Oh, seriously you want him?
Hello.
Well, do not think so, I do not think immodest, but, me?
Do you want to smell him?
Oh yeah. He has this great baby smell. Get a touch of his head.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?
Well, we are great people.
Bye.

Not really.
I mean technically it is - it's not against the rules or anything, but it's frowned upon.
Especially by this professor, we came across Judgey from Holierthanthou last night.
Well, Ross, be careful. You do not want to get a reputation, as you know Professor McNailhisstudents.
Yes. What should I do?
Well, Ross, it seems pretty clear.
I mean, what's more important?
What do people think or how do they feel?
Ross, you have to follow your heart.
Joey, that's so cute.
Hello.
Hey Hey Hey! So, how did Dana go? Any reason why I should leave a block of time open, say Thursday?
I could not do it.
You could not do it ?!
Hey, relax, I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
What?! You go out with her again!
With whom go out?
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah! Was not she?
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Joey! You do not even know her!
Oh whatever!

Morning! Hey, how is my favorite genius and my little robot buddy ?!
Do not touch him!
OK!
Well.
Um, alright Wayne, on par with me.
OK?
I keep hearing all these rumors that I'm getting fired.
Okay, they even have actors coming to read for my part!
Come on, man, you - you have to give me a second chance!
I mean, I love - I love this little guy!
Ah, ah !!
Okay, so you did not want me to touch him?
May I help you!
OK?
Stupid!
I can not believe it!
God!
Hello how are you'?

Hello.
Hello. Look, what happened earlier ...
No, hey, well, I - I understand it completely. You were, you were stressed.
I wanted to give you the chance to apologize to me.
For what? That you can throw me out of your office?
You had none
Yes, excuse me for wanting to be with our girlfriend on our anniversary, kid, what an ass I am.
But I told you, I did not have time!
Yes, you never have the time. I mean, I do not feel like I still have a girlfriend, Rachel.
What, Ross, what do you want from me?
You want me, do you want me to quit my job so you can feel like a friend?
I know.
Ooh, I have something to tell you.
What?
But I can not tell you.
Okay, but would not it be easier if you had to tell me something you could tell me?
Well, sure in a perfect world. But no, I did not promise it, and I swore to like all my gods.
OK. Is it related to Ross and Rachel?
No.
Does it have anything to do with Joey?
No.
Does it have anything to do with Chandler and the sock he keeps by his bed?
No, but we'll come back to that later!

Hello!
Richard!
Actually, I'm not here to supplement the cook.
Ohh Oh, that's okay, I hate it when people come back to supplement the cook.
As if I had nothing better to do!
So what's up?
Well, it was great to see you the other night.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come here to tell me that?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you that I still love you.

Always a pregnant woman, please! I just want you to be fine.
So is she forcing her to marry Bobby, will that happen?
Could be! Well! Well, uh, what music does Numb Nuts - Oh, forget it! I can not!
Joey, I'm scared of it.
But I really think I can do it, I just need help.
And Bobby will be here the whole time.
Of course I am! And to answer your earlier question, we are a direct gangster rap.
Listen, Rachel told me how much easier it was with her. Why can not you do that for me?
Because! Because you are my little sister!
And you are my big brother!
I mean, you are my darling all over the world.
I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad.
I was afraid to tell you.
Well, I'm scared of them, but alright.
Joey, I can not stand the thought that this baby is mad at me with you.
I want him to have his uncle.
Will my baby have his uncle Joey?
Of course he will have his uncle Joey!
We will be fine. I mean, even if we are not married, this baby will be so loved. Not only from us.
Right! From his uncle too!
And with you.
Okay, Bobby, why do not we just come and let them have a little moment.
Come here!
No! Serious! What's wrong with you?!

I had a really nice time today.
Me too. I am really glad that Monica asked us.
I would like to ask you, but um, my sister is visiting and I think she is sleeping on the couch.
You are a sister? Your sister is sleeping on the couch? Oh! I saw
Oh hey, great, you're awake. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Hello!
I am pleased to meet you. I wish you had told me we had company, I would fix myself!
As if it would help.
You are so angry!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You're so dead! I'll catch you.
Uh, it was very nice to meet you.

Oh my gosh, this is Victoria's Secret model. Something ... something goodacre.
Hello Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh dear God. I'm trapped in an ATM hall with Jill Goodacre!
Yes I'm fine. I'm just plugging in the bank in an ATM hall.
Jill says vestibule ... I'm going with the apse.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone ... I do not know, a guy.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. "Hey Jill, I saw you last night with a guy. Yes he was

I say, Drew!
Do you see someone right now?
Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm mine No, I'm - I'm not gay, I'm not asking you.
I'm not - I'm not - I'm not gay!
Personal shopping? What's this? Like when you're running around with big-headed rich people and telling them what to buy?
Uh-huh.
That sounds good!
Hello!
Um, excuse me, we changed the apartments. You can not eat anymore, that - that proboscis was over.
There is sauce?
If you have the big apartment, you have to deal with people who come all the time.
This fridge must be in stock, okay, that's your department now.
What do you do?
I think I left a donut up here.

Finally, the lines all go up, so I'm happy.
Great job team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.
Phil!
Well done.
Stevens!
Way to go!
Joel Castle, you madman!
I love you!
Bing!
Good job, it would not have been possible without you.
Thank you my Lord.
Oh, apologize. I forgot my briefcase by accident.
Of course you did it.
You forgot something else, you bastard!
Well, what about you?
You do not feel left out or anything are you?
No, not at all, that's ridiculous.
Everyone else has one, and you want one too. Not true?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes, I do!
Come out of here, you!

Hey Bob.
Hello! How is my buddy Toby today?
When I see him, I ask.
Toby!
Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob of six, are you even talking?
Yes!
Oh, then you know each other.
We have a first name base.
What do you think about adding him to our team?
Bob? Ooh, is working here with us? Every day? Yes, I do not know if he has what it takes.
"Really?" They love him at six.
But that's eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.

Hello! Guess what I got for your wedding!
A wonderful, thin date with a hanger for her head?
No, Rachel connected me with a tuxedo! But not some Tux, Batman's Tux!
What?
Right! Expressly made for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the successful film in which he found himself.
You can not wear that! I'm wearing the famous tuxedo! James Bond's Tux!
So?
So - if you carry that, you make me less special.
I'm sorry, I just do not like the idea of ​​saying "I do," he thinks, "Yeah, I would do it too!"
Well then we have another problem.
Yes!
With what?
Well, we're trying to find someone to do our wedding and they're either boring or annoying or you know, I can not stop staring at the ladies.
Oo! You should have one of us done!
Phoebe, we get
No! No! It is - it is real! Everyone can be ordained on the internet and how weddings and other things occur!
Are you serious?
Yes! A friend of mine made it and it is completely legal!
I call it !!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys, thank you, but none of you marry us.
Does not it mean something anymore?
We will have a legitimate member of the clergy! And if I say legitimate, I mean gay and control his saliva!

Look, I see ... great passion in your future.
"Really?"
I do.
Oh Ross, you are so great. [She playfully rubs her head and gets up]
It will never happen.

Everyone knows!
That should be a good thing, I forget why.
Listen, Monica, I know, okay, you know, I could not sleep for a month because I was like a stain on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, you - you could just flip the pillow over.
Yes, I only have one big spaghetti spot on the other side.
What?!?!
Okay, that's what I'm talking about. I - I have to live in a country where people can break out.
You can spill. In the sink.
Oh darling, it's not your fault, you know who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here, I do not see that.
I love you too.
Oh good. What?
What? I am only told.
No, you are not, you are wondering which pillow it is.

Oh dear God! Are you serious?!
Uh-huh.
I would like to live with you Ross; that is - that's great! Many Thanks!
Well, I am - I am just glad that I could help you.
Impressive! I am so happy for you. That's so, not stupid.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what that means to me!
I mean, I would become homeless.
You saved me!
You are my hero!
Hero, I er, I do not know - well, all right.
Oh, I have to tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please! You will say things now, right?
No.
No, I will not.
But I should tell you that, exactly the same happened to my roommate Denise.
She moved in with a man secretly married to her and he said he did not love her, but he really did and it just exploded!
And so she lived with me!
Okay, that's a lie.

Pooh!!
What happened?
I landed at Ross.
Oh, I have to count missing or something.
Damn it!
She is not there anymore.
Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
No, Joey, I think he just watches TV.

... Damn, rent the girl! Okay, all ready?
Uh, listen, I just want to thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
Me?
That's great.
Well, I will get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?
Yes, it was really hard.
Oh, yes, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Ok, you were not there.

Impressive! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
Very nice?
You have to forgive my roommate, he wanted to marry her.
We do not have $ 50, but would you be ready to trade? We have a canoe.
You know, I really do not think we need a canoe.
You have to take the canoe!
Alright, just take the entertainment center and when you get home, throw away the canoe!
We will not throw it away! I built this canoe!
Good for you!!

Pheebs?
Yes?
OK. Then I think it's just, wait here. Hello. I need a wrong ticket to Yemen.
A ticket to Yemen?
Oh no, no, no. No, no, no, I just need a show ticket.
I'm sorry, sir, I do not understand.
What would you give a child if he wants to have a ticket to play?
Are you traveling with a child?
No.
Okay, you know what, she'll think I'll hand you a credit card, but what I'm really going to do is give you a library card.
Ah, sir, a ticket to Yemen costs $ 2100, and we do not bring any tickets.
What's happening? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?

Okay, but that's the last time.
With a chick-chick here and a chick-chick there.
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick - chicks.
Hello.
Hello.
How is she doing?
You?
Well, do not think, do you think it's her?
I dont know. I can not say what it was, went back too fast.
Well, anyway, I have to change, I'm ah, I meet some of the actors for drinks.
Excuse me?
What?
Okay, fine, so let's go. Go with Vince.
Yes, but Jason is very sensitive.
Well sensitive is important, take it.
Yes.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Jason is not a wimp!
Oh no, no, I meant Chandler.

Hello.
So, apparently, people are familiar with European history?
Yes.
Listen to it, the whole uh, who came to which thing, really does not matter.
I mean, I think it would have happened anyway.
I mean, if you had not initiated it, I would - I - I know.
It was a great night.
It was. It was a great night.
You think it looked great?
Do we already have a name?
No not yet.
That's okay, because now we just call her Baby Girl Green.
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Hello baby girl.

Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
I do not like sitting here! I'll just come over
No Rachel! You are here first!
Why is Ross doing this?
DANGER
Oh dear God! Why is he jumping on these women?
No that's fine. Do not worry about it.
Oh, look! That will leave a mark!
Rach! Hello! It's good! You are with Joey!
"Really?"
Yes! Appearance!
I have never lived like this before.
I know.
Alright, do not waste it, I mean it's still food.

Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
I do not know, but one of the extras for sure! Hey, listen revenge. Thanks again for coming down to see my scenes!
Oh, honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm ... OH MY GOD, is that Christian Sanders?
Even so
Oh, in my head he did pretty "non-gay stuff"!
Well, at the Christmas party, he and Santa definitely did gay stuff!
OK, you have to promise that you'll never tell Ross that I told you.
About what?
He's planning your birthday party.
Oh dear God! I love him!
You should be better surprised.
About what?
My surprise party!
Which surprise party?
Oh, stop it. Joey has already told me.
Well, he did not tell me.
Hey, do not look at me. That's Ross's thing.
That's so typical. I am always the last one who knows everything.
No you are not. We tell you something.
Yuh-huh!
I was the last one who knew when Chandler was bitten by a peacock at the zoo.
I was the last one who knew when you hugged Joey when he moved in.
Looks like I'm the last one.

Chandler, we still have not received your father's answer.
Oh! Law. Um, maybe because I did not send him an invitation.
Chandler! He is your father; He should be at the wedding.
I do not even know the man. OK? We are not that close. I have not seen him for years.
Well, what will you do if he finds out that he has not even been asked ?!
Well, he does not have to know!
It's not like we're in the same circles.
I'm with you and he plays in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I want to swap circles.
Trust me, you do not want him there either.
OK?
No one will stare at the bride when the groom's father wears a backless dress.
So what! As long as he does not wear a white dress or a veil, I do not care.
Okay, I think I have to go shopping.

Hello! Who is in there?
How are you'?
Who the hell are you?
I think you would not believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, right?
No, Rachel, do not understand it! He can not see us!
No Yes! The groom can not see the bride!
I will not marry Chandler!
Not after that!
Okay, guys, just relax. I do it.
I should go.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yes, well, that should do it.

I'm sorry I'm late, but I'm late.
OK.
So Pheebs, what's the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well, but then I remembered that I started and there was this Pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid, but still - um, what's this book about?
Excuse me, can I burn one of those?
You know, okay, okay, okay, what's so funny here?
I thought you did not smoke.
Oh, I thought you meant marijuana cigarettes, you know?
Do you know what I mean, like Dubbies?
And I actually thought, "Wow, these guys are crazy!"
But no, I smoke the regular ones all the time.
We are going up.
Oh me too.
I'm just kidding.
Oh me too.

Oh, are you sure you are okay?
Yes.
Does it still hurt?
Yes.
What a nice idea. All your clothes fit together. I will do it.
Hello.
Hey, how did it go?
Excellent.
We tore the couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a nice story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
You know what? You're right. I
Good for you Pheebs!
OK.
Okay, if you have microphones in it, I did not mean that

That sucks! I did not know that I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
It is 6:00.
Oh well
Hello!
Hey, I heard you and Joshua are having dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's really cool.
Yes, Rach, I think you understand that really well.
Dealing with it?
What do you mean by that?
There is nothing to handle.
Well, maybe I would have a problem with it if I and Joshua were not.
You know, they will not marry anyway!
What?
Come on!
They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!
I mean, what are you getting engaged for?
A year?
And somewhere along the way one of them will realize what they have done and they will name the whole thing.
I tell you, you will dance on my wedding before you dance there.
What the hell is that?!
What, did you really think that I'd be better off giving me stuff that I can not use for another two months ?!
That sucks!
Alright, what's my next gift?
!

Okay, there is a nuclear holocaust, I am the last human on earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
I have canned food.
Hey guys! Look at that! Check this baby, dug a hole!
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole !!
Au !! Au !!!
What?! What?!! What is it?!
My drinking?
Oh, I must have said that after you left.
Said, what? Exactly.
That you enjoyed the occasional drinks.
Oh dear God!! Oh, that's it! I'm leaving! You are just a terrible person!
Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait !!
If you all become sensitive!
I do not want to lose you.
What if I create a position for you?
I will make you an assistant in this department.
Say more things like that.
You can have your own office and a salary increase! Effective tomorrow.
I need a expense account.
Done!
And an assistant.
Sophie, come in here!

Monica? You will be very proud of me. I just got appointments with two incredibly cute nurses.
Oh my!
They are male nurses.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to get us out Saturday night! What are you saying?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I do not think so.
What?
What are you talking about?!
You - you're the one who told me to get over Ross and keep going.
I move on, and you move on with me.
Come on, give me a good reason why you do not want to go.
Umm, why do not you give it?
What?
Harder than it sounds. Is not it?
Okay, you come with me, and I also tell them that when we're still here, when they get out, we go to the cafeteria and have some
Yes! There is always room for
Joey, how are you doing this?
Oh, it's easy. Yes, I-I can do it with everything. Watch out, Grandma's Chicken Salad

Hello, that's Monica ...
Yes???
Oh...
Okay, yes, we're right, we'll be right down there.
Many Thanks.

OK. Let us bring it.
Wait no, honey, sweetheart, throw it to me, throw it to me.
May I help you.
That almost hit me in the face.
A stripper at a bachelor party, that's so clichéd. Why do not you get a magician ?!
Well, if the wizard can open my beer with his cheeks, then fine.

Hello!
Hello!
You know, I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy, me too!
You know, I thought, if we had a big fight and we split up for a few hours
Yes?
Technically, we could have sex again. What do you think, imperious and bossy ?!
The wedding is over, sloppy and immature!
This is me! Come on!
OK. But wait, we can not. My cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we should have lunch.
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Shrill?! The wedding is back!
I thought I heard voices. You have to be Chandler.
Hello! I am pleased to meet you!
I am glad to meet you.
So, are you ready to go?
Yes.
Chandler!
I'll be right with you.

Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.
You know?
Only your normal third nipple.
You know?
You can take it off.
Just cut the baby off!
Take off your shirt and let us see what we are dealing with. What do you do?
I only show you my normal third nipple.
Well, that's not a third nipple.
No?
First of all, it's on your ass.
Well then, what is it?
Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in for a moment?
I am at Hamilton!
He's good with the back things, bring him in too.

Um, that's great wine.
It comes from France in Europe Western Europe. You know, a few years ago I was actually traveling all over Western Europe.
"Really?"
Uh-hmm wait! It gets better. Um, yes I was in Barcelona.
I studied a year in Barcelona.
Anyway, um, so I was um, I was hiking
I love hiking!
Oh that's great! I walked along the foothills of Tibidbo Mountain
I get it!
So? Congratulations, you two, I did not even know you were married.
Oh, we - we do not.
No no. We
What?!
Um, um ... we just have this baby together, but uh, that's all.
Why?!!
Um, um, we're just not in this place, you know? But we are very excited.
Oh. Well then stop me.
Just tell me how.
Oh, I feel that someone is coming.
Sid you lucky deaf bastard.

Let it go, Ross.
Yes, well, you do not know Chi Chi.
Do you promise it all?
Yes! We promise! We will be fine!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your little buddy with the filter tip has to stay out!
Hey, Pheebs.
"Dear Mrs. Buffay.
Thank you for pointing out our mistake.
We have credited five hundred dollars to your account.
We apologize for the inconvenience and hope you accept it.
Bye.
Yes?
What do you do'?
Oh.

Oh my god, honey, we are so destined to be together. We have both copies of the
Honey, both of you.
Hello! Great advice for this Joey-thing!
Yes? The work problem?
Oh, it was perfect! I mean, it really felt like he was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him?
Oh, that's not important. The point is, I really - I think everything will be fine.

Okay, I have a couple, do you want to put her in her panties?
No thanks, Mom!
Oh, no, um, hello, that - that, you have to get this out because I'm pregnant.
Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Very good, so good.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua did not call.
I mean, you think he was worried that I would not show up at his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is happy in Vermont!
Come on! Look where you are !!
If you have one second, another round of Daiquiris.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And do not let me go without getting the name of this rug guy.
Ahh, come on! You know what, you know what, I think I'll just go home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help.
No!
That was a test!
In a few hours, I get really drunk and want to call Kathy and you have to stop me!
And then I get so drunk, I'll call Janice
You should! How is she doing?
Oh!!
I think somebody needs a lap dance.

Okay, I definitely taste nutmeg.
They do?
Not you? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
That and arrogance.
Hello.
Hello! How was sailing?
Wow thanks!
Joe?
Yes!
Um, you already had a lot of sex, right?
When? Today? Some, not much.
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking, because somehow, um, I could not - I mean, I really wanted, but I could not.
There huh-hmm, there - there was an incident.
Do not worry about this man that happens.
It happened to you?
Yes! Once.
Well, what did you do?
I did it anyway.

'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Take what you want, please do not hurt me.
So you play a bit
Yes, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 is the dumbest one person can see, you're definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
Young! You're a man-child okay ?! Now go move, because everyone is ready and please, oh please, hold my underwear!
And they knew about it?
Okay, well, Ross, what is it all about?
Look, this is my home and I want to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, I'll do the rest of my appointments somewhere else. I just do not know what the big thing is!
The big thing is that I do not want to have any nude, greasy strangers in my flat if I want to sit back with a puzzle beer! Cold beer.

Okay, look, he will not hurt her, right?
Do you always have to bring him here?
I did not want to leave him alone.
Alright?
We had our first fight this morning.
I think it's because I'm working too late.
I said some things I did not mean and he - he threw some feces ...
You know, if you work too late, I could find him for you.
Oh, that would be great!
Okay, but if you do, make sure it looks like you're there to see it, okay, and you do not do that to me as a favor.
Okay, but if he asks, I will not lie.

Good, look at it.
Look at this.
It says that there is a place where you can rent videos from all museums!
"It's almost as good as being there."
It is better! You can not go to a museum in underwear!
Ohh O! I bet the British version is gooooood!

Uh, may I help you?
Yes, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady who got stuck with the racing car bed.
Look, it's just like I told you, I can not do anything. You signed, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester Mann, look, we want to see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
Hello! You can not go back there!
Oh dear God.

Well, that must be kind of nice to you, right?
I mean, your dad tells me you get a few days off school, and you, ah, do not have to sell those cookies anymore.
Well, I wanted to sell the cookies somehow. The girl who sells the most, wins a trip to Spacecamp and sits in one
Wow, you, ah, you really like all those space stuff, right?
Yes.
My dad says that if I give him so much time to help him clean apartments, I would be able to make a trip to the Taj Mahal when I dream about space.
I think you would have to clean a lot of apartments to get to India.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he will double the college money my grandmother left me.
Oh, um, I do not know if that's a good idea.
Oh. Look, friends, I will not touch you. I promise.
No, I just think it's too early.
No, it's not too early, I had lunch at eleven o'clock.

I invented the cup game to give money to Joey.
And now you want the money back.
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of idiot are you taking me?
It is not a real game! I invented it!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fairly and honestly.
I dont know.
But I can see through your leaf.
Yes, yes, that's it.
But, you know what?
Anyway, I will never meet her anyway.
Why?
Because it is impossible to find her apartment! She lives in a universe like the hot girl parallel or something.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. She lives on the
No, these first two windows, this is the lobby.
And you know the other over there, that's the stairs.
You counted wrong.
I did

Monica, betting the apartment, I do not know about it.
Rachel, I did not miss a question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Did you write the answers?
No! Constant like a stone! Now you are with me.
Good, let's do it.
Come on!
OK.
All right, gentlemen, you're first.
OK.
OK.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning starts - stop it - now. What was Monika's nickname when she was field hockey goalkeeper?
Great fat goalie.
Right. Rachel claims
Dangerous romances
Right. Her current favorite movie is ...
Weekend at Bernie
Well, look, why do not you just, why do not you do your strip club thing with us?
Yes, come on, we can be boys!
No you can not.
Come on! Let us be boys! Maybe we want to be boys!
You do not want to be boys, you're all hairy and you would not live that long.
You know, you just stop being such a wuss and take it off and you come along and see naked girls dancing!
OK.
I'm so sorry.

And you know what, I just realized that last year I only went out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
You have to help me here, you have to set me up, you have to get me back into the game.
Well, that should not be a problem. I mean, I work in fashion and everyone I meet is legitimate heterosexual men.
Pete, can I give you something else?
Yes, a piece of cheesecake and - and a date, if you spend it.
Did not you and I treat this topic?
Hmm, come on, you just told her it was you.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me is because of my blonde wig, and the big breasts, and the fact that I serve you the food.
Well, if that was true, I would go out with my aunt Ruth.
And the two times we went out were embarrassing.
Come on, you think she should go out with me, right?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
I mean, that's not a nice picture in the morning, you know what I mean.
This wig, all in disarray, and breasts thrown over the bedside table, you know.
I really think about it.
Ho-ho, I will.

I think I read that somewhere!
That's just not funny, it's physically impossible!
OK?
Depending on the species, I had to have a six foot long ...
It is not funny!
!
I do not agree with that.
I can not believe you wrote that on my alumni page!
Who cares? Nobody reads these things
You better not hope because I've just read what you put on your page today.
I do not have a page.
Oh oh oh! I agree with RESPECTULLY !!

I know, I miss you too. I can not wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Okay, what's in here? Rock?
No, no, that's my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I will really miss this apartment. You know, Ben-Ben took his first steps over there.
Ohh. Hey, do you remember when I ran into this thing and it blew me away a bit?
I loved this place! To tell the truth, I wish I did not have to move.
Uh, do you say that you are not happy about it?
Well, I mean if um, if Emily gave me a choice
you
Why?
Hey guys! Look, what I found in the store. Get up! Get up! Get up!

I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you do not think your son will think he is yours and is terribly traumatized?
Hey, if mom can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Oh, it's time to go.
Oh, no, no, look, that - this clock is a bit fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.
Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
Twice?
Well, that's ambitious.
Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
This is Carol with your son!
Tomorrow is here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning is here! The morning is here!
HELLO!! Do you
Oh come on! Tomorrow is here! Tomorrow is here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
I
Are you kidding? I love this guy! Tomorrow is here! Tomorrow is here
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica, you do not even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
You know what? I am
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
OK.
You see, that's a
Shut up! This place is a hole!

Alright, dude, time to roll.
No no!
No no no no no !!
You go to a clinic!
You go to a clinic and a pajama shop!

Are you under the sheet?
Yes.
Great, let's start. How is the pressure?
Kind! Wow, Phoebe, you're good!
Express the obvious, but thank you. And it's not funny.
No, Ooh
That's right, you just enjoy it.
Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
OK.
Oh god Phoebe !! Oh, that's it! That's it! Exactly there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh

Hello!
Oh, Alice, hi!
Many Thanks.
I'm so glad you could come because I have a real Umm, Home Ec emergency.
Oh my god, who died?!
Yes I know. It is a real mustard disaster. Can you help me?
Become a drama critic!
I'm injured! A plague on both houses!
By the way, he dropped me tonight after reading my review.
Oh, classic.
Yes! I know how to choose it, right? You know, I gave up part of a soap for that!
Impressive! Yes me, ah, I gave up a job too.
Really. What?
Um, entklallende cats.
Hey, say something.
Let me go home.
We'll drop by every kiosk and burn every issue of their Times and the Post.
Why the post office?
Oh, did not you see the post?
No you?
No why?

Hello Joey! What are you doing here?
Uhh, well, I have a casting on the street and I poured sauce over the front of my shirt. Do you have an extra?
Yes sure. Umm here.
Great. You have everything that is not
Yes, I do not think so, Joe.
Alright, I think that will be fine.
Hey, listen, what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, why?
How would you take out my assistant's day? I pay.
Huh, Rach I have to say that it costs a lot of money to go with a guy on a date.
I do not ask you to go to one
"Really?" Because I could somehow use the money.
Joey, just - just him - he's new to town and I know he has no friends.
Just take it to like a ball game or something similar.
I will really appreciate it.
Yes OK.
Yes?
Sure no problem. Ooh-hey, donuts!
Yes!
OK.

Problem smell in the cat toilet? Do not change your kitten, change your kitten litter.
I'm sorry, Pheebs.
Yes. Are you okay?
No! I'm sorry, I just thought you were someone else. Hello!
Hello. Well, look, I just wanted to leave a message, is not yours tonight, your big anniversary dinner?
Yes. Well, um ...
Rach, are you alright?
Yes I'm fine.
You want to talk, I mean, I can come over?
No! Really, no, please, please, that is, that's fine.
Alright, alright, I'll come over and bring Chinese food.
Oh, yes, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
It is for me.
Oh. Okay bye.

Come on, get off!
Hello?
Transit Authority?
Yes hello.
I research for a book, and I wonder what anyone could do if he leaves a baby on a city bus.
Yes, I realize that would be a very stupid character.
Hello, here is the deal.
Today we lost a car seat in a bus.
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits on a stroller.
Oh, and there was a baby in there.
He wants to talk to you again.

Hello.
I am sorry that I am a bit late.
Ah - Wow!
Way too late.
Let me begin by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller.
To summarize, I am Professor Geller.
Good job today.

Good evening, sir.
My name is Ross Geller.
I am one of the people who applied for the apartment.
And I - I realize that the competition is tough, but - I'm sorry.
I can not help but notice that you are naked and I applaud you.
Man, I wish I was naked.
I mean, that - that looks so great.
That's what God intended.

Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!
But when we were in high school, I identified James Farrell, although I knew you liked him!
Wow, that feels so good to come from my chest!
Okay, you go!
It's my turn? I beg your pardon? What are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
What?!
I heard you on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel to do some laundry for a few hours."
And he said, "Laundry?
is
Well. Sounds like you're playing a little bit there revenge. Impressive! Let me know how it happens.
Well, I would not know, because I was so crazy that I hung up.
Well, if you had kept listening, you would have heard that I called him Mr. Bigot.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
Well. So you're telling me that nothing happens between you and Chandler.
Me and Chandler ?!

I really thought you were making a good point. I mean, you know, until you got cut off.
Yes, what's up with the girl Monica?
I dont know! I did not come with her!
Alright, everyone! Any advise what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
A test? !!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions !!

Okay, I have one for you, if you had something, would you rather eat, a sighted eye dog or a talking gorilla?
I have to tell the talking gorilla because I can at least explain that you are making me eat it.
Someone went to college. Impressive. What is it? I'm so sorry.
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay.
I think it's best, sir.
But we really need to find someone here.
The work begins to pile up.
I have so many documents on my desk.
Do you know what to do, just throw them in the shed and say you never got them.
That's a good one.
What must a guy have?

Yes, yes, everyone is here. Hey, everyone, greet Julie in New Mexico.
Hello, Julie!
Is not there a national football league?
Yes. Yes, there they are, they play on Sundays and Monday evenings.
Oh, shoot! I work Monday evening.
Um, this filling is amazing. Do you think we should give them something?
If they are hungry enough, they will come in.

Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
I dont know. Do you have something for me?
Oh yes, that's from Rachel.
Ten. OK. Nowadays there is something like too many women.
"Really?"
Yes for you!

Oh, Danielle! I did not expect the machine ... Call me if you have a chance. Bye. Oh God!
This is
Hey, I sharpened!
What about the dishes?
Oh, uh ..
I want her to think I could be in a restaurant ... you know?
I may have some kind of life, as if I have not been sitting here for the last few hours.
Look! He does it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh dear God! Go away! Stop looking here!
Great, now he waves back.
Man, we have to do something about this guy.
This morning I caught him looking into our apartment.
It sneaks me!
I feel like I can not do anything!
What kind of stuff?
Will you grow up? I do not talk about sexy stuff, but when I cook naked.
You cook naked?
Yes, toast, oatmeal ... nothing that spurts.
What are you looking at me? I did not know that.

You know that a guarded pot never beeps.
It was only a few hours ago, and she did not call. Not that I do not care, you know.
Phoebe, why do not you just call her? You obviously want it.
You think you know me so well.
Well, do not you want?
Yes.
Okay, well, I know you.
That's what I said.
OK then?
I can not.
I can not.
She left me, I mean, I totally trusted her and then one day, "Okay, bye Pheebs".
You know, the saddest part of playing together was the most fun I've ever had in my life.

OK Bye. Well, Monica is not coming, it will only be me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, hold on to the camper, are you sure you've been through this thing?
It is laundry. Thinking through is minimal.
It's only you and Rachel, only you two? This is a date. You go on a date.
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
So, what are you saying here? I should shave myself again, get some wine, eh?
Well, maybe you want to rethink the dirty underwear.
That's basically the first time she sees your underwear - you want her dirty?
No.
Oh, and uh, the softener?
Ok, ok, now what's wrong with mine
There you go.

Ok, just because it was my table, do I have to buy a new one?
That's the rule.
Which rule? There is no rule, if any, owe me a table!
How did you come to this?
Well, I think the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about it?
Well, let's just say that the impressions you made in the butter left little room for imagination.
Ok, ok, how about we share it?
What do you mean, how, buy it together?
Yes
Do you think we are ready for something like that?
Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why are you moving out?
I do not take off.
You would tell me if you move out properly
Yes, yes, it's just that with my last roommate Kip ...
Oh, I know everything about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran away and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Oh, do not do that

Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Oh no, stay here, we'll do it. I will pay you.
No, I got problems earlier. See you later.
Absolute. I love the way you kiss.
Oh dear God! Oh dear God! I am sorry!
Oh forget it, it comes from
You think you can upset my daughter and not marry her then ?! I will kill you!!
You know, that's not a good time for me.

OK! So we just stay married.
Yes exactly!
And I'll make everyone call me Frau Geller!
Impressive! That's so impressive. I uh, I really thought I needed to talk more about that.
Okay, look now, I'm scared because I do not really think you're kidding.
II do not kidding. Look, I-I can not have it
What-what-what are we going to marry forever ?!
Okay, look, how will that affect you?
"Really?"
I mean, you sometimes fill out a form and instead of checking the box that says you click the box that says woman!
It is
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
You're right.
You know what?
We can absolutely stay married because I had the impression that the boxes were far away
I ask you to do me a favor.
You ask me to be your wife!
And as my wife, I think you should grant me that favor.

Oh dear God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
I think I should have understood when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.
I mean, how clean can teeth be?
My brother is going through it, he is so confused. How did you manage it?
Well, maybe you're trying to break some of their value, tell her ...
-Leg?
That's a way! I, I ... I went to the clock.
Did you actually break your watch?
Ooh, go away from you.
Right.
Barry, I'm sorry ...
I am so sorry...
I know you probably think that this is just what I said the other day about you, that you love with your socks, but it's not ... it's not, it's about me, and I say, Hi, machine cut I go away again ... anyway ...

No real, darling, really, it's okay, just go with Susan.
Really, me, no, I think girl night is a great idea.
Okay, okay, bye
What do you do?
I do not know, something girl.
Hey, you're early.
What are you doing with the lamp?
I only take it to be rewired.
Oh, do not take it to the same place you used the stereo because they've been doing it for over a week.
No, no, Mr. Heckles, no one's making any noise up here.
You disturb my exercise in the oboe.
You do not play the oboe!
I could play the oboe!
Oh! This is so cute!
Okay, okay, look, I know that I'm Mr. Inappropriate, but it's just so hard, I see you walking around and I just want to touch and hold you, do not come around anyone, just, just kiss me.
Alright, that's it! Get off her!
What's happening?
What's happening?! That's what's going on !!
Horse!
I was in your shop for twenty minutes to get a tie!
What do I have to do to get some service ?!
Hello revenge.

Horse?
Yes?
Hey, it's Mona! From the wedding.
Oh hello!
Hello!
Impressive! Uh, how are you?
I'm fine, except umm, you owe me a dance.
Oh, that's right. Well, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian movie?
Oh, you are serious. For sure!
Great! Well, um
I think I might need another cup of coffee.
For sure! Uh, let me get it for you.
OK.

Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you could tell him.
Go!
What? Hey, wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
I sometimes like to play the fool, but I'm a bit more than a pretty blonde girl with an ass that will not stop.
I think that belongs to the father of your baby.
Oh god Oh, is he in there right now?
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in and tear off the patch. What do you want to do?
Uh, let's rip!
"Really?" Are you sure?
Oh Phoebe!
Okay sorry. Yes.
Hey revenge.

Hey, thanks for those tickets, Chandler.
Oh, that was a very important experience for me and I wanted to share it with you.
Oh, you are so wonderful.
Why do not you like me? Chapter one: my first period.
I can not believe you bought that, enjoy your slow death.
I think there are people who have sex.
I can not be me, I'm standing right here.
Do you want to peek?
No!
Come on!
You know what? I do not like you without mom. Come on.
We are not peeking?
Well, I'm looking. Oh dear God!
Hello sir, you know Monica.

Chandler is fantastic !!
What?!
Oh God, we just clicked!
Do you know how people just click?
As if he came to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like that, click!
Did he tell you?
Oh I ....
Oh, and he has such a good heart! Does not he have a good heart?
Oh, I know ...
Oh, I know and he is so cute! Listen, he said he would call, so put him through.
Is not that great ?!
Do not spoil it.

Hello.
Hi sweety!
Hello.
Hello, Ross.
Yes, hm.
I have bad news.
What?
I can eat something fast, but then I have to come back here.
Come on honey! You had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
Actually, it's somehow my fault. I - I stopped today.
But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you, what happened? Burn out? Burn everything out, have you?
No, he is going to a better job.
Well, that's great, so I think that's ah, that's goodbye. Huh? Goodbye.
Alright.
OK.
We will miss you here in the area.
Yes me too.
So until Saturday.
Yes, you bet.

Whazzup ??
Seriously, 3 years ago.
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I will be outside today.
Can you just keep an eye on Joey and make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
You do not trust him?

I think the check-in is so.
Ahh.
Monica faces it, Chandler is against marriage. And - and always will be!
Well, there are some people who want to marry me.
There are?
Yes! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you ?! And - and Chandler tells you how much he hates marriage ?!
Right.
chandler
You just told me that he hates marriage!
That - that he is a complex person who probably does not take a wife!
That - that he is against marriage and will always be!
You have

You know you probably did not know that, but in high school, um, I had a crush on you.
I knew.
You did! Oh .... I always thought that you just think that I'm Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
Oh.
Listen, you think - and try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor - but do you think it would be alright if I asked you?
Sometime?
Could be?
Yes, perhaps...
Okay ... okay, maybe I will ...

Why?
Well, I just thought that it would make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Well, you are amazing.
Oh no, no.
A TV out of nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you do that stuff?
Well, you know, I'm 29. I mean, who needs a savings account?
Oh, you're the best friend anyone has ever had.
Oh, I do not know.
Oh-no-no, you are!
You do that, you give me the big advice, and hey, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, that you're focusing on a woman, I'll do that.
You mean Casey.
No, no, I think I'll see how Kathy is doing. She is pretty cool.
Or Casey.
No, Kathy.
Could be Casey.
No, Kathy.
Think about Casey.
Do you know what I think?
I think somebody has a crush on Casey.
How about I treat you both?
What do you think?
That all parts of my life are exactly right!

Hey, anyone has a length of about six feet with a small nose at the end?
Honey, what's up?
I have just seen Janice.
Because every time I see your face, I can not help but fall out of grace. I know.....
Impressive! This girl is good.
Oh-ho, yes! A song with rhyming words. Oh, I never thought of that.
I like her.
Why? Because she can play guitar and at the same time play the guitar?
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
Look at you. All jealous.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have different styles. You know, she's more .. you know, and you're more
next to meeeee-eeee-ee. ,
Okay, look, you see, everyone else is happy that she's done.
Okay, my next song is Phoebe Buffay, what can I say?
I really loved when we sang partners, and I should not have left you that way.
Oh no, one of those looking for hidden meanings.

Yes hello.
I have a question.
Um, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Many Thanks.
No,
What?! What else did he say?
Um, he said he thought I was funny.
All right, look, let's just go downstairs, we'll have fun and you'll forget everything.
Ross, no! There are
Oh come on! Rach, it's - it's not that bad.
Ross, I'm a human scribble !!
Look, just because an idiot painted on your face does not mean that you should not have fun!
OK?
And besides, hey-hey-hey nobody will
Okay, it was there

Come on!
Oh, wait, do not you have to pay for your, big boobs ladies?
No that's fine. Some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I do not do it
Oh yeah? OK.
OK.
But! Do not you have to give him back his money?
Uh-huh. Hey, this is buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's visit Monica!

Oh dear God!!! What do you do?!!
You said you want to get a lemonade?
So?!
Whoa, ah !! Will you give me lemonade?
Yes, hm !! Cover yourself!
Oh, right, right.
I do not believe that! If someone asks you for lemonade, and does that mean you want to have sex?
Well, usually ... yes!
Well, not just lemonade, ice tea, sometimes juice.
Well, I'm sorry, I just thought you like me.
I'm such an idiot.
It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not everyone I know, but ... By the way, I can still see it.

Hmmm ... that's so nice.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually it is not so much a question as a general question.
OK.
OK. Here goes. For a while I want, um ...
Oh!!!!
Yes, yes, that's right ...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
Well, I would probably do it someday.
I did not mean it
Why not?
It is brilliant!
Goodbye Mike, see you at the wedding, man!
well, we probably will not invite you to the wedding ...
Thanks, Chandler.
Yours sincerely.
Well, you are welcome! Glad I could help.
How should I suggest?
David, I do so

Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use it wisely. Come on Joey! You can not win if you do not ask
What?!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip!
We were six hours on the road and you slept five and a half!
We turn on at the next rest area and
Well. Well.
Yes! And until then you will sing to me because the radio is broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
"Really?" Not me
To sing!!
Man, that's a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Morning!

Everything was delicious!
Many Thanks!
It was. The duck was especially outstanding.
Many Thanks! You did not say anything ...
Actually, I have a small complaint.
Oh ... please, I - I welcome criticism.
The musician in front of the restaurant ... it's a kind of mood killer!
Which musician?

We made?
You owe me $ 20.
Many Thanks. Thank you very much!
Chandler, here you go, you have your traditional Thanksgiving, you have your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fondins and your family size bag from Funyuns.
Wait, wait, Chandler, that's what you have for Thanksgiving dinner?
What, what, what about you and this vacation?
Alright, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
We have just finished this great Thanksgiving dinner.
I have - and I vividly remember this part - a sip of pumpkin pie, and at that moment my parents decide to tell me that they divorce.
Oh dear God.
Yes. It's very difficult to enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse order.

Hey, who is this little naked guy?
This little naked guy would be me.
Oh, look at the little thing.
Yes, yes, well, that's my penis. Can we be grown up now?
Who are these people?
Got me.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. "Me and the gang at Java Joe's".
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Let's see, 1939 ... yes, 24, 25?
Looks like a funny gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look! I have naked Monica!
Nono, that would be me again. I'm just trying something.

So, what is this about?
Rachel has something she wants to tell you and um, I think that's your red sweater.
No. This is my red sweater.
Oh no. Could I get someone a coffee or a poison? No? Just for me? OK.
What's up with revenge?
Nothing! Phoebe made a mistake. But do you know that you wear this sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of courage?
You know, I'm glad Phoebe called.
I know we split up because you thought I was not mature enough, but I really grew up and I think we should get together again.
Oh, it's just not the time.
It is the right time.
OK.
"Kay!
In the Favorite Returning Male Character category, the nominees are John Wheeler
What the?!

Yes.
You are an Aquarius, right?
I bet you are a twin.
Nope.
Bull?
Nope.
Virgin?
Nope.
Sagittarius?
Yes.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh.
Well, I'll tell you something
Yes?
You will not accelerate anymore, right?
I will not accelerate.
And you promise that you will get it done immediately?
I promise.
And in the meantime, you should let him drive better. Does he have a license?
Yes!
Can he handle the stick?
Well
I can handle the stick !!

Hello!
Hello!
Hello.
Oh hello.
I can not believe that takes so long. How are you?
Oh, not bad. Do you know that feeling when you try to blow a Saint Bernard out of your ass?
Strangest thing. I have heard - Mother of God, it is true!
Kramer Bing!
Jan-Janice!
Not only Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Oh, that should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
Janice I did not even know you were pregnant! Who is the ignorant person you stole?
You're the one. This is yours.
What?!
Look how nervous he gets! We have not slept together for years!
This is funny. Does it - does it hurt? Does the work hurt?

Man, I'm starving! What the hell did I think about dinner ?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
You know, you know, I'm looking and I do not think there's anyone here at home.
I say we just break the window, crawl through and - and you explain it later.
Yes? "Really?" Nobody is at home?
I do not think so. Hello? If you come in there

Hey whats up?
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, that's all your fault! You have interfered in our relationship !!
You did not have a relationship !!
No, but I did my thing and everything went according to plan!
Oh God, stop the plan!
So, what did you see him with a girl?
Who cares?!
That does not mean anything!
Look, you're going on a date with Danny and you'll be so charming that he'll forget all about this stupid underground girl.
She was kind of stupid.
You're right.
All right, I'll just go to the date.
I will go to the date.
That's the new plan.
Come on, hurry up!

Hello.
Phoebe!
Ta-da.
Hello.
Hello.
Ahh, look at you, you look great.
Do I? Thank you likewise.
Many Thanks.
Sparkly.
So, wow, that's pretty wonerful, huh.
Mr. Major Capes guy.
Me, I remember when you were just like, King Friday in Mr. Rogers Ice Cream is Nice.
You always said I could do it.
Yes, well, I'm scary somehow. Wooo.
I missed you. I will change.
OK.
Um, now. Phoebs.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.
What?
Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha.

Hello Joey, it's Jane Rogers, I can not wait to wait for your party tonight.
Listen, I forgot your address, can you call me?
Thank you bye.
Hello!
Hello!
What's happening'?
Yes, it is a pity you can not make it to this one-woman show tonight.
Oh, I'd love to, but I have to get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
Oh, yes, yes, yes ...
"Hello Joey, it's Jane Rogers can not wait for your party tonight"
Stupid Jane Rogers !!
You have a party tonight?
Something has ... a thing for the days of the people of our lives.
And you did not want to tell us? How did you think you would get away with it?
I do it every year.
You do that every year ??
I did not have to tell you that !! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers !!
Oh, so you have those tickets for this piece to get rid of us?
Yes...
And why did you send us to the restaurant in the Middle Ages last year?
Yes...
OH! And the year before, when you opened this night tour of the button factory?

Who is this?
Oh, that's Ross.
Oh ... oh my god. He remembered.
Remembered what?
It was like months ago.
We passed this antique shop, and I saw that needle in the window, and I told him it was just like my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
Oh!
I can not believe he remembered!
Oh, it's so pretty. That must have cost him a fortune.
I can not believe he did that.
Come on, Ross? Do you remember the school when he fell in love with Carol and bought her this ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
F-hah .... flennin ....
Oh dear God.

I really like to wake up with you.
I also like to wake up with you. Oh! It is such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
That would be great!
We could have breakfast in bed
Wait, just a second.
OK. Oh! Oh no.

Well, that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids
Um-hmm. Oh, wait! That's Bonnie.
Hello!
This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You are Bonnie?
I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh no, I'm sorry, you look very different than the last time I saw you.
Oh yes, I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.
Well, I hope you have fun tonight.
Many Thanks! Likewise.
I think it.
No you do not.
Yes I will.
No, you do not know what, you will not take me that way.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
I do not always have to be - okay, okay.
Jurassic Park

I tell you something is wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the garbage chute.
Ross could not fit in the garbage shaft.
That's right, he almost could. That's exactly how I got stuck there.
Hello!
There he is!
Oh dear God! Where the hell have you been? !!
You know it.
Oh, oh god, I do not know why we did not think to look there!
What did you do?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just walked around for a while.
You walked through the night alone in the city?
He joined! He has connected with someone.
Look, I do not have to answer your questions! OK? I am a big boy, I can do what I want!
He joined !! Tell us about her!
Ross, you fell in love with Hey.

OK.
Oh yes, that looks good.
You enter
Yes, we look good together.
Yes we
OK.
Impressive! Imagine what our children would look like!
You know, we do not have to imagine that.
I marry her.
We will see.

Hello! Hello! Be careful with my Porsche!
Hello Joey.
Hello! How are you'?
He has the best Porsche among himself!
I'd like to show you, but I just put it in.
She sleeps.
Hey, would you like to have a drink with two girls?

Well, the old lady died.
And how do I know that?
Her last wish was for a last kiss.
But I do not care, because you have the apartment.
Yes!
Ewww. Yes. Umm. I think I will stay here.
Is not that great?
Ezels !!

Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are you feeding? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
Wow! That's great.
Oh yeah!
You know, you could totally sell that. It would be perfect for Umm, a cat kitper campaign.
I ..., a jingle? No no no no no.
What? Why not? You could make a lot of money.
Okay, well, if I was here for the money, I would be millionaire now, you know.
You just have to come out of this jingle-head sweetheart.
Oh, you're right, you're right. I'm so sorry.
That's okay. Okay, I'll play songs that are really, very sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.

Okay, sir, um-mm, let's see if I got it right.
Ah, so that's half a cafe, twice the size, light hazelnut, fat-free, no foam, with a whip, extra hot latte, right?
OK great.
You crazy.
Many Thanks.
Um, coffee please, please.
Isabella Rosselini.
Are you serious? Oh dear God.
Damn it! I can not believe I took her from my list.
Why? Otherwise, would you do it?
Yes, perhaps.
Oh-oh, you're lying.
What do you not think that I would go to her?
Ross, it took you ten years to admit that you like me.
Yeah, well, Missy, you'd better be glad the list is laminated.
You know what sweetheart is, you go ahead, we call it an alternative.
Okay, hold my crawler.
OK.
Rach, do you really want to let him do that?
Honey, he'll meet Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we do not have popcorn.
Okay, that's enough.
"....
Do not you want to dance with me?
Aha!!!

Oh-oh-oh, yes! That's right, you take good care of these babies!
Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!
Do I know you?
Joey!
Oh-ho, yes. Yes, the handkerchief.
Okay, that's fair.
Well.
Well!
Choose one.
Left! Many Thanks.
You're welcome.
Horse!
Joey! We should just change.
Yes absolutely!
Yes.

Rachel, we're sorry you put these guys on you.
Oh, that's alright!
You know, I had a really good time.
As you know, the charity was a great success and they raised a lot of money and attention.
So, what was it for?
I want to say a disease.
Hello!
Hello!
I just got this really funny message from Ross. He said, turn on
Huh. Well.
Oh my god, look! That's Elizabeth!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Yes.

Hello! So, was he upset about the tickets?
No! He blew us away!
What?!
I know!
I can not believe it. May I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
May I tell you something? Me too.
You know what? He did not want to talk to us about being angry, maybe we do not talk to him
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
Right!
I like this!
Doorknob?
Yes, it somehow grows on you. Actually, I wanted to break up with you over uh spring break.
Oh good.
Listen, I see, I have a great time with you and I just do not want to move too fast or put too much pressure on us.
So, I'm sorry, I just do not think we should go away together.
It is - it is too early.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I said. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a few weeks.
No, I think you got something wrong
You are so adorable.
The! Let us talk about it.

Hello!
How do you feel?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe in twelve to fourteen hours.
Okay, so I
And she protected from a tornado?
Oh dear God.
I know the babies sleep.
Phoebe, what, what happened here ?!
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
But my apartment!
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
Not as important as the fact that Phoebe cared for the babies all by herself.
You're right, you're right, I should not freak out.
Because that will happen when you and I have babies!
When will that be?
!
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess?

Hello!
Hey Ross! The baby is kicking!
What?! It is?!
It just does not happen. Although we would like to see you do that again.
Hey, when - when did it happen? What happened?
Last night! I just felt it and I went to Joey's room and he was sleeping
A dreamless sleep.

Come on, people, tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is still that you're dismissing Barry at the altar!
Alright. Let's talk about reality for a second.
OK.
When will you come back home?
What? People, I am not.
Come on, that's us.
I'm not! I do that now. I have this job -
Waitress?
Okay, I'm not just a waitress.
I am..
I, um ...
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh ... and me, uh ...
I take the uh dead flowers from the vase ... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle drops the little chocolate blobbies on the biscuits.

We're leaving around midnight, why do not we pick you up?
So, um, are you bringing the truck?
I even let you ring the bell.
Oh dear God.
Look, there you go, the cleaning works!
They are nice people.
Oh, they are firefighters.

Your son.
No no no. I have no son named Jordie. We all agreed that my son's name is Jamie.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
How are you, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
I understand it.
I understand it.
I understand it! Hey, you fall asleep with her, I get the cramps.
No, do not do that.
Alright, that's it. I want to get you both out.
Why?
He started it!
No, you started it.
You did!
I do not care. I'm trying to get a person out of my body, and you're not making it easier.
But...
Now go!
Many thanks.
Look what you did.
Yes, listen ...
out

Oh, and I can speak a little French as well. Voulez-vous coucher with moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh dear God! No wonder I get so good service at Cafe Maurice.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
Um, could you please tell Sergei that I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
You did not say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he is too.
Interesting.
So I wondered ....
Okay, ah, before you get loud again, could you please tell Sergey that I really like his suit.
Uh, he said, thank you, he thinks, you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden as the sun.
So you are a chef?
I also think about opening my own restaurant.
Really.
Monica, can I speak with you behind my menu please? What do you do?
Well, I had a conversation.
Yes, but Misha is so interested in you that Sergei and I could not say two words.
What should I do? Do you just sit quietly while you talk?
That would be great. Many Thanks.

So we finally get to the top of the mountain and Airhead forgets the camera!
Oh, you know, the same thing happened to me once.
When did this happen to you?
Do not you remember when we jogged in the park and we saw this really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture - I did not have my camera!
Oh yeah. First of all, the Churo guy does not hunt jogging.
Oh, that's so good that you have to try it.
Damn it! I have it on my pants.
Here, I will get it.
We better pull these pants up, otherwise the stain will rise.
Yes. I will wear them tonight on our date.
Oh cool!
Okay bye! Oh dear God!!
That was incredible!
Okay, you see? I told you!
Yeah, wow, I'm sorry, Rach.
I do not think they are brother and sister.
You are brother and sister !!!

Action!
I found the picture!
Which picture?!
The picture of my wife! In your backpack!
You went through my personal property?
Why do you have a picture of Paulette in your backpack ?!
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene, yes?
Oh you are great! And in this last speech? You drenched me.
Many thanks.
Here is your diary for tomorrow.
I know.

So, Chandler, your parents must have been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Oh yes, I should probably call her.
I remember when we got engaged.
Oh, I do not think I've ever heard this story.
Oh father, you really do not have to
Well, I made Judy pregnant. I still do not know how that happened.
You do not know how that happened ?! Her dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
Well, at least you do not hear it for the first time at your Halloween party in fifth grade.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Anyway, we are really excited about our wedding plans, and I guess soon we will make a big withdrawal from Monica's wedding fund.
What?
You say Jack, I can not do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund, right?
We have it. Only now we call it the beach house.

After applying the wax and linen strips on leg number one,
Did this!
Grasp one of the line strips by its "simple grip tab" and pull it off in a quick, painless motion.
OK. Oh !!!!! Oh oh oh!
Was not it painless?
No. It was painful. Oh my god, they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin shirts on the commercial do not seem to think it's that bad.
That's because their nerves are probably killed by being so stupid.
But hey, you know, if you do not believe me, please, from my guest.
Owow-Ow-Ow! Oh dear God!!!
Well, are you glad that we did not start with the bikini strips?

Now remember that you have to introduce yourself to me in a kilt.
I can introduce you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Do you want to start telling secrets?
No!
Well, remember, I'm still learning.
One two three four!
You know the song! Sing along!
So?
No!

Oh dear God! That's David!
David who?
David, the scientist, David, in whom I was in love, David, who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Oh dear God!
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Phoebe?
David! What - what are you doing here? Should not you be in Russia?
Yes, I'm just, I'm in town right now for a conference. Um,
Good yes. You look good too. Did you get a haircut?
Yes. Well, I - I have thirty of them.
Yes.
Yes! Santa Claus is coming!

Hey, um, I'm really sorry for what happened in the cafeteria today.
It's not a big deal. Hey, you know, you do what you have to do. Law?
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides
What ever.
That's the way it is everywhere, Joey!
Okay, Mon, help me up here.
Where do you work, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
And the cooks eat with the other cooks, right?
I eat alone in the alley because everyone hates me.
Listen, Ross, really, it's not a big deal.
You know, you're wearing a white coat, I'm wearing a blue blazer, if that means we can not be friends at work, then so be it.
You know, I understand.
You know?
Hey, if I'm in one piece and you're in the audience, I'm not talking to you, right?
So you know, it's uh, it's cool.
I'll see you tomorrow then.
Yes, when we are in the audience, he does not talk to us, but he waves.

You looked like an idiot.
Hey, I was not the only one who looked like an idiot.
Well?
Do you remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"
And it came out, "squatternut buash?"
Yes, that's the same.
That's it. This is my bad Thanksgiving.
Oh, wait! That can not be what Rachel is talking about. She did not even know that happened. So what was it?
Which one?
Um, I - I really do not want to tell this story.
Oh, come Monica, experience past grief and become depressed as to what Thanksgiving is all about.
You know, for me anyway.
And of course the Indians.
Ironically, you do not want me to tell this story!

Hi Guys.
Hello! Phoebe.
Hello Phoebe.
I - I wanted to apologize for being a bit nervous at my shower yesterday. You know, it's just the hormones, you know?
no we
Hormones.
Hormones, yes.
Your parents'?
Yes, they are not in town.
Ohh.
Yes, yes, that's it
Yes, it works.
You-they-they can smell fear.

Bing! Ho! And the bing-ette!
Darling, do you remember my boss Doug, right?
Yes hello.
Hello. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers of this A.M.
I did not know you and Carol were divorced, I'm sorry.
We are sorry? Finally I chewed my leg out of this bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you!
No leg biting for us, sir.
Oh, give me time.
So the divorce, the wedding, we have a lot to celebrate.
How about we all have dinner together tomorrow night?
I can not think of anything we do. Why can not I think of anything we do?
Tomorrow evening it is time, I should be out of court at six o'clock.
They repeatedly accuse me of these cases of sexual harassment and I keep knocking them out of the park!
Okay, see you tomorrow!
Just so you know, we will not see him tomorrow.
I can not spend another night with this man.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
No.
That's because he was not invited because he had behaved at our engagement party.
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts

Now you may just like the whole duck in there! Who cares, you know? Now I have my legs
How many times have I already told you?
Hello shopkeeper.
Hello!
Uh, listen, I need that sizzling pan Joey lent the other day.
Oh, that was yours? Uh, yes, we used it when the duck threw caterpillars.
William Sonoma
Expect it in 4-6 weeks.
Umm, hey, um, Joey will be at the Telethon for the rest of the day, we have all the space for ourselves.
Yes, so?
Well, I just thought you might spend some time with the best you've ever had.
Do you know what, champion? I think I will survive.
Why?
Why?
What are you aiming for?

So, what's your name?
It's Jake.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Yes, big fan.
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday, do you want to go?
Yes that would be good! Let me make sure I do not do anything on Tuesday.

Pooh. Horse!
Hello! Sorry I'm too late. Did you sleep?
Ahh, no !!
Oh cool!
Listen, oh I had to get you a brand new battery.
I gave you the best, because I do not want to save.
You are a genius, Ross.
Yes, well, it came to about $ 112, but what the hell, just call it a 110?
Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow.
OK.
Okay bye !!
So, um, they all ran away, it was pretty hard to watch, you know?
Yes, okay, bye.
So I'll go then!

Hello! Oh yes, tonight was your party.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you made it.
Well, you know, the gala had to end sometime.
Do not go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yes sure. All right, whose court is the ball now?
I thought there was no ball?
Oh come on! He is glad that I came, he does not want me to go anywhere, balls fly everywhere!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom.
Oh, go on! You tell people about me?
You could really do it! I will meet.
So you work
Yes, okay, soothing, soldier!
I am sorry?
No, it's alright, you can just drop the act Tommy.
I know what's going on here.
Your Danny's wingman, right?
You are the best buds.
Frat bros!
I will talk to a friend.
Yes, yes, you are going to talk to your friend. They tell him, "Nice try."
Man! He just keeps throwing them up and I knock them out of the park again and again!
I think I need a drink.
Yes!

Hey, Pheebs?
No, I can not talk to you! I do not have a great ad in the yellow pages!
Look, Pheebs, I just want to apologize for telling me that your method is stupid and - and perhaps asking you to be my teacher again.
And - I promise I will not touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
Do you really think I'm ready?
Uh-huh!
Impressive! Cool!
Was the chord at least correct?
No!

Well, that was fun.
Yes. Yes, thank you for allowing me to use your phone ... and to save my life.
Well, goodbye, Chandler. I had a big blackout. Bye.
Hello, um, I'm account number 7143457.
And, uh, I do not know if you have any of this, but I really would like to have a copy of the tape.

We start to see a lot of layers of transparent fabrics and colors. For example, a sheer dark blue blouse over a pink ....
I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Sorry, I'm sorry, I have to call you back, I have a schema in my office.
What do you do?
I'm so sorry.
But ah, hey, oh, someone is on the phone, how about a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Ross, you are not listening to me, I have no time to stop.
Come on Rach, you do not have anything, ten minutes?
I do not have ten minutes !!
What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross !!! I told you, not me!
Do not yell at me, that's the best thing I've seen you all week.
Listen, I can not do that now, okay, I have an appointment, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
Yes, but wait ...
Goodbye!
Actually, this is our three hole punch.

Oh yeah? When?
Well.
I will tell you what.
If we are 40, if none of us are married, what do you say that you and I get together and have one?
Why am I not married when I'm 40?
Oh no no. I meant only hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why will not I be married when I'm 40?
No no no.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally immoral about me?
Uh, uh.
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a backpack!
Hello.
Hello. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Did you go home and changed?
Yes, well, it's an important day. I want to look good. Um, Dr. Franz blue already over?
No, I did not see him.
Well, where is he? He should be here. What if the baby needs it?
Rachel, how are you and doctors? Was your father a doctor?
Yes why?
No reason.

I am the holiday armadillo! I am a friend of Santa and he has sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Alright, I'll do it only once! But you can not tell anyone!
Yes! Yes! Please give it to me!
Yes that is her.
Many Thanks.
It's incredible! I can not believe that this sign did not work!
Do you know what would work?
Hmm?
Stop making sweets!
But they like it!
You mean, they like you.
Could be.
Is that why you became a cook? So people like you?
Oh, you really want to talk about making people like you, funny man?

We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new millennium, and the guy screamed 'CUT!'
Um, wait, so you tell me that you did the routine from the eighth grade?
Yes. But of course we had to update it a bit. Hey, by the way, great to think about catching me!
Because I would say that you could never have made the end like you did back then!
What? We could do it!
I do not know, I mean, you were much taller, I mean stronger then.
I can do it, okay? Come on let us go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can not do it!
Now you do that, you're on TV.

Hello!
So, what are you on the market for? We have uh, scarves, tulip postcards ...
Look at this? Huh? Yes. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I do not have to buy that, "I'm with a stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. May I help you.
Alright, look, you're not really going to buy, are you? Do not you think that you embarrassed me for a day?
Oh, I'm embarrassing you?
How can I answer that, if I pretend I do not know you?
He is just jealous. You will fit in directly; all Londoners wear them!
Really? How come that nobody here wears them?
They are all tourists.
Alright, if you insist that you wear it in public, you know you'll spend the rest of the afternoon alone.
Oh yeah? If you let me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Good choice.
Many Thanks.
OK wait. Okay, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I will not be ashamed anymore!

So! I'm just an empty vase, right?
What?
You know, I do not read as many important books as you, and I do not write trick phrases that are about one thing, but something else.
And you know what, I'm happy about stupid things, like when I mean mine
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You do not even know me ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
What?
The empty vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think so.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe ...
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Oh yeah.

Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back - stop! Okay, forward - stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross, just forget it. This guy totally wedged you.
Is it yours?
Well, actually
No no no! It belongs to me! It's-it's mine.
Dude, you need this car soooo.
OK.
Okay, here are what we will do.
Okay, I'll get into that minivan and put it in neutral.
You push it forward so Ross can leave his seat.
OK?
Alright, here we go.
Haul ass !!!
!

It is said that by the year 2030 there will be computers capable of performing the same number of functions as a human brain.
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer ...
... and live forever as a machine!
This is Janine, you-you-know what, do you know that we're doing right now?
You and me, we have an interface.
Yes, I have to go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!

David, can you help me ?! I try to explain to Chandler how an airplane stays in the air.
Oh, sure. This is a combination of the principle of Bernoulli and Newton's third law of motion.
See?
Yes, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Alright, I'll get some stuff for the trip.
Oh, I should go, too.
Oh, well ... tomorrow you want to share a taxi to the airport or should Mike and I meet you there.
Oh ... Mike's sister invited me to a party tonight, he'll be there.
And she said, "Oh, do not worry!
I asked him.
He is totally alright to see you! ".
So I have to go now so he thinks I'm perfectly alright to see him!
What you are not because you completely hung him up!
Exactly!
And you'll want him to eat his heart out so you have to look fabulous!
I did not even think about it! Aaargh,
Hey Pheebs, I-I'll take Charlie shopping, why do not you come and I'll help you find something.
Ok, that will be great!
Oh, is not that nice? The three of you are trying on dirty lingerie together.
We will not do that!
Why would you ruin it, who was that?

Julie Hello! Chandler Bing, I think you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.
It's a nickname, I'll explain it later.
It is pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I should never have quit with you because you were overweight.
That's why you broke up with me?
You-you-did not know that. Well, I think my job here is done!

Ni-chou Chi-ma!
Horse! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Hello everybody.
I just wanted to thank you for our little talk.
Oh god, no problem. So you will go with the uh waiting thing?
Well, I wanted, but after talking to you, I talked to Joey.
What has, what did he say?
Basically he told me to get over me and just do it, you know?
So I thought about what you said, and I thought about what he said and, well, in his own way, I get sex tonight.
,
,

Oh cool!
We could not keep our eyes off each other all night, and now and then you know he somehow leaned over and stroked my hair and touched my neck.
Okay, stop Phoebe, you bring me tingling.
All I could think of was, you know, "Will he kiss me, will he kiss me?"
And does he?
I am a Lady Monica, I kiss and do not tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay - okay, I got it. I understand it.
I just like it so much that I feel like I have 10 drinks today and I only had six.
Oh, I did not have that feeling since I started dating Chandler.
Wow, I'll never have that feeling again, right?
You sound like a guy.
No, a guy would say, "I'll never sleep with someone else."
Oh dear God!
I will never be able to sleep with someone else!
I was so busy planning the wedding that I forgot all the things I was giving up!
I mean, I will never get a first kiss again.
You will have one last kiss.

Thank you for coming back.
Oh well, you are here. Yes, and I was worried that it would be uncomfortable.
I know Mona, just listen to me.
First of all, I am so sorry that my father yelled at you, but I have heard that you have kept yourself completely private.
You will have to tell me how you did it.
Focus.
OK. Um, okay, yes, Ross and I used to make an appointment. And yes, we will have a baby. But we are
Alright, where is this turkey!
Joey! These are my novelty pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!

No.
No!
Yes!
Ahh.
Oh, would you take a look at this Monica?
I just cut off all your top scores, how sad.
Okay, I'm the next one. Not! Do not start another game! I said, I'm the next one! Phoebe!
Oh, I am sorry. I did not hear you throughout the victory.
Chandler! Phoebe breaks the game!
Remember, I had to leave the room the other day when you had this roast chicken?
Yes. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and let it run across the table.
Anyway, it's just not worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. OK? It is much work.
But you have to have turkey on Thanksgiving!
I mean, Thanksgiving without turkey is like the fourth of July without apple pie!
Or Friday without two pizzas!
All right, good! If it means so much to you! But - there will be a ton left.
No, will not! I promise, I will finish this turkey!
Okay, you're telling me you can eat a whole turkey in just one session?
Right!
Because I'm a Tribbiani!
And we do that!
I mean, we may not be big thinkers or leaders of the world, we do not read much or run very fast, but damn!
We can eat!

Well?
Impressive! It is huge! It's so much bigger than the cabin. Oh, that's a cube.
Look at that!
Oh! You have a window!
Yes indeed! With a beautiful view of ...
Oh look! This guy pees!
Hello.
Hello.

You know what? I can not do that with my left hand! Would you please, help me too?
Ohh.
OK. Let's use this brush.
OK. This stuff?
Yes.
Well.
Carefully. Light. Okay, you know how, just sweep over the lid. OK? Just sweep.
Oke-Dokey.

Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, technically it's not a zoo, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
Let me ask you a few questions, right, Marcel?
Yes.
Does he fight with other animals?
No, no, he is very docile.
Even if he were ... cornered?
Well, I do not know. Why?
Uh, how does he deal with small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's what ...
How about a hammer or a small blade?
Why - why - why would he need a blade?
Well, if he goes up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you have to give something to that little guy.
Otherwise it's just cruel.
He - he came in, he - he came to San Diego.
We, we come back from our walk and that - the phone rang ...
...He is in.
He is in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You make a big mistake here.
I mean, San Diego is all well and good, but if you give it to me, I'll start it against a blind hare and give you twenty percent of the profits.

My copy is in the room and I would like to thank only the one who knocked on the door when I was there.
Really helped to speed up the process!
Janice!
You are not ... gone?
Oh!
Sid is still in his room.
I do not allow porn at home, so it's like a vacation for him.
So you did it?
Did you make your deposit?
Yes! Yes ... the difficult part is over!
That's not the hard part, honey! The hard part is what's next, I mean, are not you worried about the results?
I have not ... I have not even thought about the results ... I just assumed that everything will be fine.
Oh! Well, you know something? It is possible.
Phoebe, where is your purse?
No no! Give it to me!
You can not have it.
Give it to me!
No
I'll go in there.
Oh yeah.
Phoebe, come here
Haha!
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!

What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with someone who did not live during the bicentenary.
I only had sex.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, that is different. My lie did not make one of us a felon in 48 states. What did you think you were doing?
I did not think. I was too busy with the case ...
Do not say it.
...in love with you.
"Really?"
We are sorry.
Well, drop out.
You know, you should not even be here, it's a school night.
Oh god, oh god.
I am like these women you see with shiny guys called Chad.
I am Joan Collins.
Who?

That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some space!
Oh darling, maybe you'd be better off here?
You. As if you had not done enough.
Look, I - I know how unhappy you are, I wish I could do something.
I mean, I wish I was a seahorse.
Because with seahorses it is the male, they carry the babies.
And then, um, I would be far away in the sea.
God. I have never felt so uncomfortable in my life!
Oh, I know, I was there. I remember the end
Oh Phoebe, that's a great story.
Can you tell me if you bring me ice tea?
Oh God, go away!
Go out!!
Go out!!
Go out!
!
Let us.

Alright, I know! I know. Yes, everything will be fine.
Oh my God. What will he do now?
I can not watch!
Oh.
Seriously, how can you see that?
Are not you afraid?
Frightened.

Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Hmm, listen, there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is it about you - you're with the nurse?
Yes, Joey has already told me, and I'm fine.
I mean, you and me, we're just, you know, we're nothing, we're going around.
Um, actually I just wanted to tell you that it was me, I would come out, but hey, if we just fool around, then maybe me
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Well, it was pretty big. I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
You-you-you threw away my sandwich!
MY SANDWICH? !!!
MY SANDWICH !!!!!!

What's going on, Pheebs?
She has canceled! My namesake has canceled me!
What?!
Yes, she clung that she suddenly had to leave the city.
She avoids me, she does not want to tell me where my father is.
She knows, and she will not tell me.
Aww Pheebs, that's shit!
Yes, well, do 'Aww Pheebs, that's shit!' Me, yes.
Where are you going?
Well, she's not in town, there must be something in her house that tells me where my father is.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call this breaking and entering.
Well, are these people here ?!
Oh my god, me too!
I knew it, wow !!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Sweet or ugly?
Oh so sweet.
Uh-huh, all right! But um, I'm still - I'm mad at you.
I know. I am also mad at me.
Well, would you want to eat something? I am a bit hungry.
Hello! Me too!
Alright, stop it. Now you're just doing it to upset me.

Ok, you can do that.
It's like removing a plaster.
Just do it very fast and then the wound will be uncovered.
Janice. Hello, Janice. OK let's go. I do not think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Well. Well, you see. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

Oh dear God! The guy at the counter checks you out!
"Really?" My God, he is really cute.
Do it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
I'm just saying, get his number just in case.
But no: Chandler is in an accident and can not perform sexually and he wants you to take a lover to satisfy the needs he can no longer fulfill.
Op, can I tell you something? Very flattered, but hmm, I'm engaged.
Well, you should be embarrassed.
I did it, but it was really fun.

Hello.
Chandler. I felt that it was you.
What?!
Unagi. I am always aware.
Okay, do you know that Unagi is an eel?
How are you?
I can not figure out what to do Monica.
Oh, why do not you make her your little joke?
I'm going crazy! OK? Do you have anything here that looks homemade?
You know what?
She would ... that would love her.
Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I did it in sixth grade.
Yes, I think I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yes, yes, except Apollo 8 did not really land on the moon.
But you - you - you could write this, your love makes me circle the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I can not give her that.
Why not?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
OK, see you later.
Hey, thank you.
Impressive. Well, I think it was Amor who brought her here.
No, just a normal old flying dwarf.

Oh. Oh, I just can not believe Clark got me up!
He could still show up.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
That's all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Um, why do not you tell about your beautiful wedding?
Well, um, we wanted to tell you something about the wedding.
Um, it will be a little ceremony.
Uh, tiny!
We are not even sure why we have it.
It's just going to be family.
Oh, you two, are you thinking of me as a family ?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; Do you want me to sing?

Come to me. No, no, you come to me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcement.
Oh cool! What, did you bring Joey?
Well, I brought the next best.
Whoa! Do you know what Katie? I have to tell you, I-I-I-I think you're the one who's too much.
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Ohh, and the nicest friend!
You're so sweet!
Ohh, you are so cute!
Ohhh !!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.
Well? Are you going to do something?
Uhh.
You better do something, or I'm just leaving this door! Well? Will you?
No.

How could you take a pickup ?! He could be a rapist, a rapist or a killer or something!
Do not you think I asked him before he came in ?!
You know what? I do not talk to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist ?!
No!
Do you like car games?
Yes, do you know the license plate game?
I
Ooh, I will play! I will play!
No no! You need your sleep. Night night! Shh!

Pheebs, can you help me choose an engagement ring for Monica?
I can not figure that out!
It is so hard!
Should I give her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or an-ah-ah?
Paper cut!
Did you tell someone else?
No, I do not want to tell anyone because I do not want Monica to know.
You told me.
Well, because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you approached me when I looked at ringlets.
Well, again, no knock pays off. I just wish you had not been in the bathroom.
Me too.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello! So, Chandler, do you want to go to the coffee house?
Oh, sure.
Yes, coffee house.
Oh perfect, we just wanted to see if you wanted to go.
Well, we do not, because we got the other PL place.
How rude.
Oh, I am sorry. You want to bite?

The stripper stole the ring !! The stripper stole the ring !! Chandler! Kramer, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What?
The ring is gone!
Pooh.
Just a second, give me a minute to wake up - Ah-ha-ha !!
You lost the ring!
You are the worst man ever!
Dude, that's not funny!
What will I do?
I'm going to bed last night, everything is cool!
I wake up this morning, the stripper is gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
Of course !!

What difference does that make?
Well, I'm just - if the paste fits the pants, you can make a paste pants and she will not know the difference!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what should I?
Uh, Rachel is here, so good luck man, let me know how it works.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Well, you could not be timing better. I bring fire everywhere.
OK. OK. OK. Joey, I have
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you can not tell anyone.
Oh no, no, no, no! I do not want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you want to know! That's incredible!
I do not care, revenge! Look, I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can not tell anyone about it!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are you?
And you should not clap !!
I know, I know! I can not keep this here, so I pick up the phone
I do not listen to you!

Oh! Yay! Appearance! There is a piece that has no bottom!
Stay on your side!
Hey, come now!
Well, what do we have?
Uhh, I do not believe in these crazy diets, you know, just in moderation.
I'll take those to go. For the children.
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then you killed yourself. What happened there?
It was so stupid that I said a few things in an interview that I should not have said.
But believe me, that will not happen today.
Roger that. So what did you say back then?
Well, I said that

Ha!
So you like the drums!
That's great!
You know, I was worried that maybe they would have an unbearable life situation.
Alright, okay, well, apparently not!
So yes!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, look at it, we've already learned a song. Ready? One two three four...
Tequila!!
That is fun.

Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Yes! And he really said mean things that were only partially true.
I'll go down there and teach the guy a lesson.
Joey, please do not do this. I think it's best that we just forget it.
It's easy for you to say you were not nearly killed.
Okay, that's it, the school is in session!
My God! Is this a fitness card?
Oh yes, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I missed the last 1200 times.
So why do not you stop?
You do not believe that I tried? I think so
Who is Maria?
Oh, Maria. You can not say no to her, she is treated like this Lycra spandex covered gym.
Do you need me to go down with you and hold your hand?
No!
So you are strong enough to see her alone?
Oh no, you will have to come.

Many Thanks.
Many Thanks. Monday?
Hmm?
Pheebs, I do not think anyone is mad at it.
Exactly! Because it is in the past!
Will someone eat that?

Pheebs!
Hello!
Look, you know how um, if you wear trousers and you lean forward, look at your underwear?
Yes!
Well, when Jake did, I saw that he wore women's underwear!
I know. They belonged to me.
Oh. No! No, wait, that's weird!
No it is not! We just played around and I dared to try it on.
That's weird!
I'm wearing his pants right now.
That's a bit hot.
I agree. And this little flap? Great for my lipstick.
Yes, I would not know that.
And! Do you know what Jake says? This lingerie is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels to his skin.
Yeah, well, the next thing you know, he'll tell you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! OK? He is whole man! I think even more than you.
Oh yes, he looked like a real woodcutter in those pink sheets.
All I'm saying is that only a man absolutely sure of his masculinity could walk around in underwear!
I do not think you could ever do that.
Hello! I
Okay, anyway.
Fancy the meat.
What?
I dont know. A cowboy theme?

Hey, um, is it alright to come?
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring, I ... it's beautiful, I love it!
Yeah, look, Rach, there's something I have to tell you.
Hello!
Hello! Are you ready to try again?
Yes! Hello, Emma. Hey, why do you think she will not take my breast?
It's all right darling, it takes some babies a while to get it, but do not worry. It will happen.
Yowa!
Okay darling, you can do it. Just open and put in your mouth.
Dear Sir.
I'm sorry, honey, what did you say?
Oh uh ... yes, I think so ...
Oh look, she pulls away!
Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
She looks startled.
Does not she look scared?
You know, I do not really know her.

Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
But do not worry, I'm sure they're still here.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo".
Actually, the night of tomorrow somehow depends on how tonight.
Oh, uh, listen, tonight ...
No, no, no, do not you dare to catch me.
The only reason she goes out with me is that I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like this ...
Pathetic mess?
I know, but - come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
I think, cha-ching!
Many Thanks.
Look, you have not been with a woman since Janice.
You do that.
Hello. She said yes.
Yes! Keep it up, man! Still the egg, right?

"Happy Birthday!"
You pay for it.
What? No, no, it's her birthday!
You sung Happy Birthday today to 20 different women!
But it really does
You are no longer allowed to distribute birthday muffins.
Damn it!
Rach? Hello!
Hello!
Did you tell your sister to ask me?
Good yes
Oh wow!
I mean, wow!
I mean, I - I - I think she's cute, but I - I never thought to go out with her, never!
Really?!
Yes, but after you say it's okay, I thought, "Why not ?!"
Oh so-so not really never.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
I mean, after all we've been through, all I know is that I wish I had a brother who reciprocated it.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh-ho and mine!

Okay, so no toners today. Thanks anyway, bye.
No - no, wait - wait! I can not just let you down! Please just talk to me.
Well, I only have one thing left today. I think I could push it back.
Yes! Why do you want to kill yourself?
It's just that, um, I've been working on this meaningless, dead job for ten years and nobody here knows I exist!
Chandler?
I am sorry?
Do not look, I'm sure people know you exist!
Oh yeah?
I work in a cabin surrounded by people.
I've been talking to you for five minutes about killing myself and nobody looked up from their desk.
Hang-Hang up.
Hi Guys!
Uh, I'm going to kill myself!
I will get in touch with you.
I do not have anything.
Waiting.
Uh, hey margin!
Eh, nothing.
Nothing.

Apparently there are a million people out there who can play Mac, and there is only one robot and one controlling it!
I did not know that he could dismiss me!
What should I do?
Now you know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I have a problem here.
No honey, you have to win the guy that C.H.E.E.S.E. controls! You have to kiss a serious robot ass!
That's not a bad idea.
Yes.
Okay, but if I'm allowed to cast the spell tomorrow, I will not waste any more time with you here.
Well, actually I saved Pheebs a bit for you.
So you think Joey is more charming than me?
Yes! That's why I sleep with him on the page.
Yes, you wish it.
"You wish."
Why are you screaming?
Whoa, that

Whoa Whoa, what's that?
Well, it's a date.
A meeting?
No, no Pheebs you - you must be wrong, because I know that you would not plan a date on the night you have plans with a friend!
Come on Joey, do not let me feel bad.
No, I will !!
Right!
Yeah, you really have to feel guilty about me going out with the girl!
Much like I did something terrible to you!
And now Pheebs, you do the same!
That is not the same! This is
Okay, well, my girl from the other night was special. She was also a scientist!
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
Okay, anyway.
You know what?
I have no time to convince you, because he is only four hours here and I will visit him!
Fine!
Yes!
Fine!
Yes!
What are you still doing here ?! I told you, lobster ravioli!

I'm sorry, I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur ... thing ... anyway.
Hello.
Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?
Horse.
Hello Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for ...?
Dr. Oberman.
..DR. Obermann. OK. And he is
You.
- Is she natural - familiar with our ... special situation?
Yes, and she is very supportive.
Okay, that's great. No, I'm - Oh.
Many Thanks.
Quack, quack
Horse? This opens my cervix.
Barry?
Come in.
Are you sure?
Yes! It's okay, it's okay. Robbie will be here for hours.
Huh?
So how are you?
... flame boy.

Does she use the cups? Yes! I think she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I think she does.
Oh. Many Thanks. Ohhh, thank you. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!
No, let me in!
Phoebe?
Yes!
Can you wait just a minute?
No, you have to let me in now!
Are you alone?
Yes!
Well.

Let go!
No! You let go!
No!
How come we are always on the field and holding the ball?
I dont know. I guess the other people just do not care enough.
Hello! It starts snowing.
Give me that!
Let go!

You know what?
Umm?
I bet ya ya I could fit in there.
I have five dollars, says you can not.
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot or just fall. This is good.
Kink fan?
Oh yeah.
Oh, boy, suck her.
Hey, listen, lady ....... whoa.
Look, look at your husband, Ewing. Nice shot. You know, he could not hit a water when he was standing on a boat.
Oh yeah? And who do you like?
The Celtics.
The Celtics? Ha. You could not hit a boat if ... wait. They suck, okay?
Oh shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You ... Waah!
What? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a dad over here! We need a father!
There is no father.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
OK that is alright. I'm fine. I am ... oh!
Oh, um, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be here.
OK.

Honey, give me another chance, okay, let's start again. We will return to Aruba.
Dr. Farber, we have an emergency here ... Jason Costalano choking on his keeper.
Oh God...
I'll be right back, Bernice.
Please, please, do not go anywhere, okay?
I will be, I'll be right back.
OK.
Okay, we will be here!
To hate you!
Did you see how he sweated when he went out?
Listen, sweetheart, if I hug the ball too much, you just talk in and take a couple of shots, because I'm telling you, it feels that way
Yes ... I'm pretty sure I'll still marry him.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He is Satan in the tunic!
I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still want Mrs. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Oh God.
I hope you can find a way to be happy for me. And I hope you are still my maid of honor ...?
And I hope Barry will not kill you and eat you in Aruba.

Listen, Robert will be here any second, will any of you tell him?
Oh.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him, it's like, "Is it on the loser?" "Does it look like me?"
We can not tell him, you can not go to a guy you barely know and talk about his ... stuff.
He is right, even if it says something complementary.
Hello!
Hello.
Are you ready for the gym? You have this new climbing wall, we can see each other.
No, I can see you from here.
What?
Okay, listen to Robert ...
I have no time for that.
No, that's the game.
What you just gave up quickly.
Did you see Joey?
What's happening?
Oh, only that! Do you know what I'm really to blame for, because the couch is usually where we are
Hey, would you like to give me one of these tiles?
What's happening?
He pulls back my floor.
Yo !! Spackle boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you have started, you will finish it.
He started with me first!
Build the unit Cinderella, put the tile Cinderella.

Come on, Chloe! First complete with your customer. Come on, Chloe! Come on, Chloe !!
May I help you?
Oh oh.
Uh, you know what, we worry about our copying needs. And we need a little more time to think about it.
Chloe, change with me, there are some guys here who have a crush on you.
Okay, that hurt us.
Hi Guys. I have not seen you since this morning.
Well, ah, ....... you know.
Hey, what are you going to do tomorrow night?
We both?
Could be. Does that scare you?
Relax. It's just Issac's D.J. in the Philly. They should come.
We'll be there.
Great. I will ah, until then.
All right, rock on.

Umm, candles, champagne, yes anniversaries are great.
Because you know that love lasts forever, you know.
Nothing like this in this life, money in the bank, so Rachel and I split up.
Oh God, Ross I'm so sorry.
Oh well.
You know, I'd love to talk to you about it, but we probably should, if we could really get involved, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
Oh yes, I would love that.
Oh cool! Me too.
I suspect it all started when Rachel got this new job.

And why do you care so much?
Because! You could live my imagination!
You had fantasies about Emily?
No! You know,
That's why you were the only one in junior high school who was with this Ukrainian kid?
Yes, and his mother used to smear everything with sour cream!
Ahh.
Do you love her?
We said it would only take two weeks, you know?
You love her!
What-what is love really?
Ohhh, me
I am a good kisser.
Then you two, you can sneak into the cockpit, and things will heat up, and then a stewardess comes in. I watched too much porn

Basically, that's very easy. They read from the script and try to sell as much toner as possible.
Okay, I can! Oh, by the way, me
Why do not we do a trial run?
Oh ok. Um, alright. Hello, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies. Can I talk to your supply manager please?
I am the supply manager.
Um, okay, I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.

Kathy! Kathy! Hello!! Kathy! Kathy! (She does not hear him and keeps running, Chandler chasing her as a topic
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Hello!
OK.

Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your old blouses and high school clothes?
Yes, I think I have something somewhere here somewhere. Why?
Well, it's just that maternity wear is so expensive.
Hey, revenge! I have made a pile of your things on this side of the room. If you could just throw your purse on it.
Bloomingdale's
Oh my god, are you unemployed?
No, but they put me into personal shopping. What is only one
OK!
Come on, do not peek!
Our eyes are closed and we are about to cross the street. Very well.
Okay, open up!
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is that
Yes, it is for our catering business!
I think I know this girl.
Well, um, we will not really keep it that way.
No?
No, we will paint over the sword and replace it with a baguette.
Oh!
And we also do not know what to do with it.
Oh yes, I definitely know her.

You do not know ?! Rach, you attacked my girlfriend!
Well! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with someone else?
You know, hey! You're the one who finished it, remember?
Yes, because it was me
You still love me?
No.
You still love me.
Oh, yes, yes, you - you love me!
No, no. What does that mean? What do you want, I want, come back together?
No!
Could be!
I, I do not know.
Ross, I still can not forgive you for what you've done, I can not, I only, but sometimes, when I'm with you, I just feel it ...
What?!
I only feel, me, me - I only ...
What?
I feel...
No !! I do not care! I will not, I will not play one-to-one strip poker with you to practice!
But I made maps !!
Well! Good night. I go upstairs.
Good night.
Want to play strip poker for practice?

What do you do?
The key is in the lock.
I can fix it. Please wait. Danger. Danger.
It still does not work.
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have extra pants? Um, my friend seems to have had a small accident.

Is not it incredible ?! Monica and Chandler, get married.
I know they will be
Oh, I mean two best friends who fall in love, how often does that happen?
Not
No! I am so happy for you!
Me too! So happy for you!
I am so happy and not at all jealous.
Oh no! No god, definitely not jealous!
I mean, I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what is 2%? That's nothing.
Total. I am like 90/10.
Yes me too.
Hey uh, do you have the scene Chandler?
W-no, but you know who stopped here looking for you, Tennille.

Do you remember the guy from the cooking school I told you about?
Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Well, I'll fill it as a food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Wow, Monica! What a great opportunity to influence dozens of people.
How can you say yes, what about our catering business?
Oh no, no, it's only one night a week, and besides, I can take you all for a night
Yay !!
Oh, in this case - Yay! That was me when I hopped aboard.
Oh.
Hey guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for you. Are you ready to party?
Hello.
Hey, it's me.
I know you can not stand being in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try to apologize over the phone.
Everything me
Hello.
Look, I should never kiss your girlfriend, but it's me
Stop calling !!
Hello! Hello! Hello! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $ 1,000 daily challenge.
Well!
What is your roommate's name, who is very, very sorry and would do anything?

Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you already at home? !!
Um, I think he's still outside. What is wrong?
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left this message to me.
"Pheebs, do not make it, have a date, talk to you later, Big Daddy." Great dad?
Oh, that's a nickname we wanted to try.
Hey, do you know which nickname never came through? The Ross-A-Tron!
Hello!
Oh! Here is Joseph Francis!
Oh-What-Ho! What do you call me?! I left you a message!
So what?! That does not give you the right to leave me!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there's a chance to have sex!
Phoebe, he's right, that's the rule.
I do not accept this rule.
If we make plans, I expect you to turn up.
Okay, I can not just be a way to kill time until you meet someone better!
You know, friends and girlfriends come and go, but that's for life!
Did you know that he was there?
No.
How long have we been at home?
About half an hour.
love

Lighting. Uh, romantic lights.
Ooh, nice.
So, there was this thing that I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, right! I completely forgot that.
Well, I have thought a lot and look at my life
Yes?
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Impressive.
There is one thing missing.
What's this?
It is time for me to conquer the physical world.
OK.
Monica, I want to be the ultimate battlemaster.
Do you want something ?!
I want to become the ultimate battlemaster! It is the most intense physical competition in the world, prohibited in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, teaches me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I even designed my own octagonal training ring.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Yes.
Monica, I want you in the front row if I win.
I want you close enough to smell the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.

Okay, come in?
Yes, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger was beeping again.
Yes, I know, guess who bleeped him?
What?!
I am the broken spleen.
Why would you do that?
Because you should not be with him. You should be with me.
"Really?"
Yes!
That's what killed me when you talked about Roger!
Look, things like last night just do not happen.
You know?
Or at least not for me.
Or with the other two women, in the morning you know, I just lay there and I could not wait to hang out with my friends, but with you I always know with a friend.
Chandler!
I know you probably do not want to go out with me because you make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I think I'm not really a "doctor"
There was only one woman, was not there?
No, there were two.
Including me?
Oh yeah.

Hello!
Welcome back!
Hello! Can we continue where we left off?
I do not know, I'm still pretty tired from this afternoon.
Why?
Uh, the sex.
Which gender?
Our gender.
We did not have sex.
Well, if I did not have sex with you, I had sex with someone who looked very similar
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Oh my god, Stu! I can not believe you did that! Are you absolutely sure that she is a hooker?
Either this or that is just the best and most expensive date I have ever had.

Would you look at her? Will I ever find a friend again? I will die an old maid.
I am your mother.
Ehh?
Oh, and then Monica joked that she would not go out with a guy like Chandler ...
Hello.
... and he could not leave it, and ... I do not know what happened to it either.
Oh oh!
And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, appears, and Rachel persuades her to save her head.
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to decide between Rachel and the bald girl and I do not know what happened there ...
You know what? Stop, let me get Chandler.

Er, Mr. Morse, can I talk to you for a moment?
Well, I lied before.
Oh!
oh God
Now you know how you really feel.
Oh-oh, this is a risky little game!
Are you really going to do that?
Yes. I will have a baby. I will have a baby. I will have a baby!
With who?
Ah, it's still not the time.

You said I was boring - ohh!
When did I say you were boring ?!
Oh my god, I remember now! We played chess!
Phoebe! You and I have
Oh come on!
Yes, do you remember the time on the frozen lake?
We played chess, you said I was boring, and then you put off your power mask and you were Cameron Diaz!
Okay, there is one

Ok I leave!
Because I will not spend a day with someone sabotaging any of my movements.
That's you, Rachel!
Yes, I understood that.
And you! I throw myself on you and you say no, how gay are you?
Take care, Jill.
Okay, see you!
Goodbye!
Bye.
I can not believe that Jill is gone. I can not help it, I opened a gate.
How about you move?
Appearance! That's ridiculous. We should grab you !!
Hey how are you?
Great! Monica is moving!
I'm not!
Really?! How come that all your things are in this box ?!
Okay, people. Guys, I think I know what's going on here. Okay, people
No Phoebe I'm crazy!
Well, deep-deep-deep!
Yes, I'm just mad!
Then keep running.

OK!
Oh, here's this trench coat you wanted.
Oh cool! Impressive! Yes, it is comfortable.
Yes?
Oh! Here we are
Okay, you know, we talked too much about London, did not we?
No.
I'm so sorry.
It's only because I could not be there.
Because all I can do now is pregnant stuff, it just makes me ready.
We are sorry.
What happened?
Well, you know, a little bit of it, a little bit of it. I have a date tomorrow.
Do you see, did not I tell you that ?! You're passing Ross!
Well
Go out!

I just did not see the fast song coming.
Shh.
Shh.
Do not try to talk, we'll take you to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be fine.
Oh thank you.
This is so cute!
Yes.
No I'm serious. There are so few really nice people out there.
Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding the fort all by myself.
Is Joey right?
Yes.
Wait a minute!
No!
I am the beautiful one!
I'm the one who danced all night with the kids!
How small are your feet?
!

Um, do you mind sitting there? II save this for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Impressive! I did not know that he has a nickname.
Oh, he will not be sitting here.
Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers are sitting here.
Yes, it must have fallen back a few blocks. I just thought, we hit a dog.
OK.
Listen, you can put Kathy on, I want to apologize.
Oh, yes, man. Joey.
Hello.
Oh no, it's alright, do not worry.
Yes, no, stop apologizing, it's okay.
Yes!
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I should probably go.
Yes. Yes! Yes.
I forgot my purse.
Oh.
No, I really forgot my purse.

A new place for a new horse. I'll have you and all the guys from work set up as soon as you know it.
I have to say, it's nice to see you on your feet again.
Well, that's me. And all this anger is definitely behind me.
I wonder if it is time for you to join our team in the museum?
Oh Donald that - that would be great. I'm totally ready to get back to work. I what? No! What do you do? !!

.... and 12, 22, 18, four ... What?
I wrote boobies.
Ross, but I'm waiting for another box of mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the coins?
Ah, we are outside. I sold them all.
What?
Monica, I'll cut you off.
No.
No, just a few more boxes.
It's not a big deal, alright, I'm-I'm cool.
You have to help me with a few more boxes!
Mon, look at you. You have biscuit on your neck.
Oh God!
So, how many have you sold so far?
Look at this. Five hundred seventeen boxes!
Oh my god, how did you do that?
Okay, the other night I left the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' left the planetarium without trying to sell 50 boxes!
That's where the key to my success, the Munchies, came to my mind. So I started at NYU dorms around midnight.
I sell cookies through the case.
They call me: "Cookie Dude!"
Okay, stop what you do, I need envelopes, I need stampers.
Well, hey, who made these applications for you?
Me! On my computer.
Like a solar eclipse.

Hello.
Hello. Soap? Shampoos? Do you really take all these things?
Why not? It is built into the price of the room.
Yes, but you do not need - What is it?
Thread!
Result! Where are the disposable cameras?
Which disposable cameras?
The cameras? Do you remember last night that I told you to take her?
No you have not.
Yes! Notice? Just before we cut the cake, I went to you and I said
Oh - oh yes, you - you came to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my uncle Murray came to you and gave you a check.
And then you said, "Why do you call it a check?
Why not a Yugoslavian? "
Yes, then you did that.
So you have no cameras?
No. Sorry, man.
So? What? What? They are gone! Monica is going crazy!
Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere in the hotel. I will help you to look for them.
Great.
In three minutes.

Uhh, Rachel, my parents
Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello. Well, Joshua, those $ 500 were for food.
What?
This - that, no, no, no, no, no, that's not - that's - that's not it.
You see, okay, I work in fashion, see and - and, that's actually a real dress.
It is - it is, they carry it - they wear it in Milan, so it's my job to put on the clothes, and then I see how people react, and then I join in with my superiors
Maybe in L.A?
Yes!
There you go.
Have you eaten children?
Well, we would do that later - I mean, um, the next one.
Well, we're starving, why do not we all go eat something?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's useless to waste this baby just lying around in the house.
So we go eat.
Yes.
You will carry that. We will eat, and of course you will bear that.

Well, I think I should have thought about my wife and kids before I talked to Koch Geller!
Many Thanks.
Yes! Looks like it's going to be a leeeeean Christmas in the Dragon House this year.
Enough!
Lean Lean Lean!

Let me see that.
This one here.
Trisadecaphobie.
The fear of
No! No, fear of number 13.
fear of
It is possible they have really sharp edges.
Good, Chandler, you are awake.
Wait, I - I think I'm entitled to use my fishing pass for a free round?
This game makes no sense!
You know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
Oh, come on, Ross, I think we're all losers here.
Well. Chandler, you can either flip the wheel or select a google map.
Let me think. Let me think - Oh! I do not care.
You have to choose Mr. Bing.
Either it makes no difference.
Choose, you donkey!
I take a card.
Okay, you have chosen the Gimmie card! You get all the points from Ross!
What?!
This game is fun.
You do not think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just because it's you
I do not think the candidates should talk to each other.

Hello? Oh, hello Ross! See? Other people call me!
Very funny steed!
Very lifelike and funny.
OK.
Oh no, no, I did not wave to you.
Whoa, maybe I was!
Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross' building is flirting with me.
Come in, man! Flirt back, mix it!
Yes, I-I-I'm done with it.
Okay, here it goes.
How are you?
It worked!
She waves me over.
Okay, II'll-I'll be right there.
Let's see, she's on the third floor
Impressive! She is pretty, is not she?
Tell me about it, right? Oh no, no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewuck!

Hello!
Hello!
Oh darling, I'm sorry, you were right, that feels great!
See? And you do not care if people stare, it's just for a second reason, then you're gone!
Path! I mean his amazing pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hello! Watch out for the horse! We are sorry!

Oh people, I did not move to Europe! I just moved through the hall! And
Ahh! Are not you dressed yet?
Am I naked again ?!
We should meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah, okay, I just talked to the guys. Look at them, I mean, is it alright when they come to visit?
Whom? What about my allergies ?!
Oh right, your allergies. All of you, she hates you.

Shoot! We no longer have soda.
Oh, I go out and get something.
Really?!
Nope! Because I am not your friend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Well, um, Phoebe, my mother's friend, is actually my mother.
I found a dry coast.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
Oh, my new mom, who - who is a big, fat eye-catcher!
Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Do not you want to stay here and talk about it?
No. I'm just, I want, I have to be alone.
Monica!
Oh.

Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yes baby!
So we never heard of your wedding!
We were surprised that we were not invited.
No, no, it was only our parents and one or two friends. It was a little wedding.
What is not to like? Vanilla pudding? Well. Jam? Well. Meat? Gooooooad.

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Do you want to have dinner in the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
For sure!
I'd love to!
So you
Well, I can not give you a massage because my license has been withdrawn!
Phoebe, what happened?
Well, it was an accident ... You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes your hand just slips out!
Do I have a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Oh no, you should not divorce for 7 years!

Um, that's nice.
I know, is not it?
No, I mean, that feels really good. Is it a 100% cotton?
Yes! And I got it for sale too.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards just wanted to disassemble a nuclear device.
Well, if you want to drink something later, we can.
Oh, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it is, it will ....
I know. Many Thanks.

So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!
Do you have Rachel pregnant ?!
Who has?!
You did!
Yes. Yes, yes, I have. But - but it was, it was only one night thing. It meant nothing.
Oh? "Really?" Does that mean my daughter for you? Nothing?
No! No sir, um, it means a lot to me. I mean, I'm worried - I - I love Rachel.
What?!
Oh, but not like that. I mean, I mean, I'm not in love with her. I love her like one, like a friend.
Really? How to treat a friend? You get her into trouble and then refuse to marry her?
Hello! I offered to marry her!
Wh
But I did not want to.
Well, why not? So can you spend your time with this tramp ?!
Tramp?!
I'm so sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.

Yes, Fran.
I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy! ...
Oh, really, really, really?
Well, let me tell you something ... you'll take care of it because I'm interested!
You have it?
Well!
Whooooaaaa ....

Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men?
Hey, Joey. Did you hear about the new guy?
I could have birds.
Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to prevent that.
Many Thanks. I will go to my dinner party again.
Alright, goodbye.
Okay, Janice. Janice. You have to give me Janice. It was not about being picky.
We give you Janice.
I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
"Oh dear God."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it, there, faster!"
Stop the broom, we will not make a noise.
We won. We won!
Mr. Heckles.
How did it happen?
He had to sweep. They found a broom in his hand.
That's awful.
I know. I swept yesterday. It could have been me.
Sure, you could. You never know.
You never know.

Oh, I am sorry.
Where is Chandler?
Oh, it took him some time to mourn.
I am free! I am free!
That should do it.

Hey, look at me. I make jam, was already since 4 o'clock in the morning.
Where did you get fruit at four o'clock in the morning?
Went to the docks. Bet that you do not know that you can get it in wholesale.
I did not know that there were docks.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, is it broken?
No, I have to wear this thing for a few weeks.
Did you tell the doctor you're bouncing it on your bed?
No. I had a whole story, but then Chandler sold me.
I'm sorry, Joe. I did not think the doctor would buy that he just fell out of the socket.
What's this? Fruit?
Monica makes jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, why do not we have marmalade with us?
Because the kids need new shoes.
I go to business people.
I'm sick of being depressed about Richard.
I needed a plan, a plan to get over my husband.
What is the opposite of man?
Jam.
Oh, Joey not!
It is way too hot.
This will only be my charge.

Hey, is anyone else doing bad about Ross?
Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Well, he's probably angry after you called him this morning to borrow his glasses.
What? Mine are not toned.
Here you go Pheebs. Who would like one of my special homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Okay, I will not have one.
I will not.
No, no, it's just my tooth.
Alright, I'll have one.
So what's up, you need a dentist? I have a good one.
No thanks, I have a good one too. Me, me, I can not see him.
See, that's the problem with invisible dentists.
Why? Why can not you go to him?
Because every time I go to the dentist, someone dies.
This is so weird because every time I go to the dentist, I look at the hygienist's blouse.
Phoebe, what? Um ... what ?!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was John, my mailman and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
And all these people actually died?
Yes, while I was in the chair!
That's why I care so much about my teeth now that it's not about oral hygiene, it's about flossing to save lives!
Pheebs, come on, you did not kill anyone, these people died accidentally when you went to the dentist.
It is, it's just ah, a coincidence.
Say that to them. Oh! You can not, their dead.

Hello?
Horse.
Emily, hello! Uh, how - how was your flight?
It was terrible. I felt terrible as I acted when you said these wonderful things.
No, no, that - that's fine. Um, I'm just glad you called.
Ross, um, there's something I have to tell you, there's - there's someone else.
Does that mean the same in England as in America?

You know what? I will not be able to enjoy that.
Yes, I know, it's my birthday. We should all be here.
So let's go.
Maybe we should stay for a song maybe.
Yes, I mean, it would be rude for her to leave now.
You know, the guys probably have a great time.

Okay, I have three of my five.
Three of your five, eh?
Celebrities with whom I am allowed to sleep.
Oh dear God! They give that a lot of thought.
Yes, it's hard okay, I only have two places left.
Alright, so who did you confine yourself to?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely ....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
Uh, you know, she's political, she probably would not let it, unless you first donated four cans of food.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hu. Very hot, very sexy. But do you know that she is too international, you know, that she will never be around.
So?
So, you have to seize the opportunities, pick someone who will be in the country all the time.
Yes, that's why you will not get Isabella Rosselini, geography.

Oh, that's five steeds. Five women got five babies! And I did not have any babies! Why does not she want to come out?
Do you know what I think?
I think you've created such a nice home for her in the past nine months that she just does not want to go.
Oh. Look, you're shitting me. Oh God!
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
Doctor, you have to do something! I think you have to give me drugs or you have to light a fire and just use it up.
Actually, I think that you are ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters, you will soon become a mother.
My God. OK. Ha-ha-ha, hit you! Suction cup!

Are you already here?
No, darling, they are not, but do not worry, because we will find them, and until we do, we are all there for you, ok?
OK.
Hello.
May I see your boarding pass?
Oh, no, no, I do not have one. I just have to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I'm so sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but I - he just kept going.
He's almost there, he's wearing the blue jacket, I ... I-j-only ...
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, all right, OK, um ... then could you please, uh ... just give him a message for me? Sorry? This is
Alright. What is the message?
Uh ... I do not know.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me please? Uh ... I have a message for you.
What?
It's from Rachel. She said she loved the gift, and she will see you when you come back.
Toby ... Oh, for God's sake, I do not know what she's talking about!
There is no Rachel!
Do not give me this freezer.

Here's the thing, Janice.
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I'm like the Bing, Bing, Bing.
You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
I struck her in the eye! I struck her in the eye! This is the worst division in the history of the world.
Oh dear God. How many of them did you have?
Oh, I do not know, a million?
Kramer, simple, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la.
I'm fine.
Well.
I'm not okay. Here she comes.
Wait here. To breathe.
How you do that?
It's like a present.
We should always break up together.
Oh, I would like that.

You win.
Well, what did you have?
It does not matter because nothing works about three and six.
That my friend is D-Cup.
Okay, did you win a lot now?
Uh, wow, 700.
Not exactly 700?
Yes.
Double it!
What?
Well, you see in cups, once you get $ 700, you have to double it.
"Really?"
Hey, I did not invent the rules.
Now, after receiving the doubling bonus, you will receive a card.
Now a card could be worth $ 100 and bring your total to $ 1,500.
Do not be upset because that will not happen if you do not get it - no way!

I'm sorry you did not go to Spacecamp, and I hope it might make up for it.
We present Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!
!
Really Mr. Geller, you do not have to do that.
Oh come on! Here we go! Ready for mission countdown!
I am an alien. I am an alien.
Oh no! An asteroid!

Hello.
Hello.
Where are you going?
To the bank.
Sperm or regularly?
Sperm.
So you really do that, right?
Oh yes, chose a guy, 37135.
Sounds good.
"I'm afraid so. Brown hair, green eyes ...
No joke, hmm.
What?

What's going on, honey?
Nothing nothing.
Aaaah, what's up, come on.
It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.
They are my friends.
You have a problem with you.
In that, they do not.
Oh. Not you.
But they do not see all the wonderful things that I see.
You do not see all the goodies and all the sweet things.
They just think you're a bit ...
What?
Intense and scary.

Hello.
Hello.
Yes! You do not like Kathy.
You got me.
Yeah, you avoid them since we go out. Look, I did one
Yes. Law.
Good, and hey! My pleasure. But that's just because you do not eat, right?
OK.

I can not believe we are here.
Oh, you're kidding.
What?
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the bridal suite.
No!! You've been shitting us all day!
Who are you?
We are only ten seconds later!
Yes!
You already got the first class tickets; You have the lounge!
I mean, we should also get free stuff!
I mean, you're not the only one on your honeymoon!
Well, you can have the suite if you want.
We do not care where we live.
We are here to celebrate our love together.
We do not have to get any free stuff.
We just want to be together.
We need the stuff.

Yes!
Okay, so how about a handshake?
Oh god, I'm sorry!
Oh god, I'm sorry!
I did not mean to touch that - I mean

Hey Pheebs!
Hello!
Listen. How much of a man am I ?!
Impressive! Kind! Male and also a kind of slut.
You become a woman.
This, of course, brings us back to Greely's theory of dominance.
Okay, that - that's all for today.
Oh, does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Yes, it is the new building on Avenue A.
What?! That - that's all over the city, I should hold a seminar there in ten minutes.
Ooh, dude. That will not happen.
Move it! Move it! Move it !! Hello!!! I am the teacher !!

Jason?
Yes, come in.
So Phoebe, you ah, somehow sounded serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
No. And I do not think I want that.
I can not do that.
Yes. Yes, I did not want to know that.
Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, you know?
I'm just doing it to get back to Ross.
I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
Ahh!
Nice, smear!
You know?
Look, if you want to go back to Ross, I'm here for you.
"Really?"
No - no, I say - I say, I say, we come right back on this couch.
Exactly here!
Oh God. I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Are you sure?
Yes. I can just go home and come back alone.

Here she is! Future Fashion Superstar!
Oh Joey, I'm hardly one
My little sister Dina!
And it starts
I've seen this movie once, where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally opened it, millions and millions of beetles were spilling out and they sipped on human flesh.
You know, it would not kill you to respect your wife's privacy!
Dull cabinet full of bugs!
Joey. Joey, something feels strange and not funny. I do not know - Wow!
Oh hey, wow, do not worry.
OK.
When my sisters were pregnant, they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
"Really?"
Absolute.
OK. Oh God-Ow! Oo!
Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything will be fine, trust me.
OK.
Take my hand.
Here we go.
Oh, bone crush!

Oh hello.
Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We have seen each other a lot lately.
We have. Maybe we'll meet at dinner tomorrow night, say around eight o'clock?
Well, maybe we will do it. Oh!

Well, a girl does not want to hear that.
No, come on, do not start. Ouch!
What?
Stupid balls are in the way.
Well. It would probably have been the most constructive solution.
You have chalk on your face.
Huh?
Oh, Ross, you're right, I do not know why I always thought that was real grass.
Hey are you ok?
My wife is lesbian.
Cool!!
Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.
Hello.

Hello! Where are you going in these pants? 1982?
Oh Monica, listen, I, I saw at the hardware store, they have these designer tiles on offer.
If you ever want to repeat the bathroom floor.
Why, what's up with my bathroom floor?
Nothing. It's just old and grubby, that's all.
I doubt that very much.
Oh yeah. When you move your basket, you can see in what color the tile was. Yes.
I can not live like that! What do we do now? What do we do now?
Relax. Here, hold that. This old stuff just comes right away.
That's a bit more than I wanted to see.
Oh!
Take a look, every inch of this stuff is stuck.
It would take forever to find that out.
You should ah, you should just leave it.
I can not leave it! You hit a hole in my dirty floor.
Eh! There you go.
You know that's nice, you know we could bring it back after the surgeons removed it from your colon!

Hello.
Hello!
Hello!
Uh, Pheebs, about your mother ...
Yes?
How does it work?
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my mother fell asleep on my stomach and growled.
This is so cute. I will get coffee.
Huh? What did you say, Joe? I will soon be there.
Pheebs ...
I just feel like that, uhh .....
Well!!
I'm coming !!
My goodness!
Really?! Do you think that will work?
Absolute! And if not, can I get the extra ticket?
What the hell is that?

Hello.
Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
Hey, Joey!
Hello!
Oh!
Oh!
I'm just saying someone on the-who looks exactly like you in the subway.
And I wanted to go over and say hello! But then I thought he did not care if he looked like you.
That cost me only four dollars. But listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Ohh, they have one
A bit, but I just had too much fun.
So you still have no homesickness?
No, I do not think so.
All right, the seven of us miss you.
No.
You'll see.
Liam, do me a favor. Tell the boys to make Ross easy, this is his first time.
You do not say it!
Good luck, darling.
Horse! Horse! Come on! Come in here! Horse! Come on!
Ross, come on! Go into the damned crush! Ross, get in!
JOEY !!!!!!

I do not think you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
We are sorry, sweetheart, but we only assumed that if you got married after you turned 30, you would pay for it yourself.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
I'm feeling better.
OK! When?!
Well! Well! It was the best nap ever!
Uh-huh!
I said it! OK?! But it's over Joey!
I want to do it again.
We
Why not?
Because it is funny!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Sure, what do you have?
Warm milk and

Are you alright?
I need some milk.
Ok, I have milk. Here you go ... Oh! Better?
No...
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he met!
Pheebs, if I had never met him, it would never have happened!
I am sorry! No, I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry!
No, wait, oh, what do we regret?
I do not know ... right, he is the pig!
Such a pig!
Oh God, he's such a pig,
Oh, he's like ...
He is like a big disgusting ...
...as a...
... pig ... pig man!
Yes, good! OK...
Oh, but he was my pig man ... how did not I see that?
Oh! I know! It's because ... he's beautiful, and he's charming, and when he looks at you ...
Ok, Ok, Pheebs ...
The end.
Oh God...
Should not I have told you?
No, no, trust me, it is, it is much better that I know it.
Uh, I just liked it better before it was better ...

Well, yes, it is an unusual house.
It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths.
But you know, the ocean is right there.
Knock knock knock.
Ah, oh, wait a minute. Come in, come in. All right, think about it and call me back.
Are you, Phoebe Abott?
Ahh, yes.
Hello Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friend, daughter!
You are Erwin's daughter?!
No, I - I mean your - your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Notice?
Oh God, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I ... Then you have to be?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yes. She named me after you, I think.
Uh-huh. Impressive! Well, look! There is Frank.

Dude, you have to get involved
Let us have a look at you.
Nah, Monica is watching a cooking show. Come on, I do not want to miss when you're lean.
Chandler, Chandler, do you know what we should do? You and I should go out and buy new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to see that. , Did your cable go out?
No that is
Joey, why is your cable out?
I, oh! Because, uh, I did not really pay the bill
If you need money, please - please let me lend you some money?
No, Chandler.
Listen, forget it, okay?
Look, I know, since Janine moved out, things were a bit tight.
Oh, she was hot.
Whoa ho.
I know!
Yes, but look, I can handle it.
Well?
Listen, I can listen to the radio, right?
And Ross gave me this great book (keeps the
Alright, do you want to see if the joke booth lets us see the show?
For sure.
Paid your phone bill?
Not as much.

Oh well, okay, I can not take it anymore.
I can not take it anymore.
So you win, okay?
Here!
Pheebs?
Fly a jet?
Make it a spaceship so you can return to yours

Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Phoebe!
Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe, woo!
What?! What good is that for anyone?
Well, it helps the bee to work hard in front of its bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Well, you know, the bee probably died after stabbing you.
Damn it!
Back in 30 seconds people!
Hey, sorry, would you mind changing with me?
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Come on man! You were here all day!
Yes, I - I take promises here, eh?
We are in 3, 2,
Welcome back to our Fall Telethon. Now if you have enjoyed the performance of

Ah.
Yes.
Well, you know something?
I'll go to my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her.
Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Yes. Yes, you need a good pill for that.

What are you writing?
Well, Joshua is coming tomorrow, and since I do not have the courage to ask him, I'll sell him a coat and put that note in his pocket.
Oh yeah? Joshua, call me sometime, people like you never go out of fashion - what did you throw away?
Hi Guys!
Hello!
Hey, what have you been?
Oh, we visited a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert Hewitt Museum.
Without me?!
My uncle dragged us there. But it turned out that it was really interesting.
Yes.
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean, look at that!

I'm just saying if I see another picture of Ed Begley, Jr.
I can not believe you would rather go out with him than me.
Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Well, just stop thinking about me.
Can not do it, right?
I think of you. So what?
I do not get it. What do you even see in this guy?
Well ... he is a very nice guy ....
I mean, come on, buddy
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
No, no, no ... why, because it could be funny for everyone else?
Who cares about her?
That's about us.
Look, I - I'm in love with you since ninth grade.
Ross, you are like my best friend.
I know.
When we split up and I lost you ...
Oh God.

Hello? No, she can not come to the phone now. Oh, right, no problem. OK Bye.
Was it my job? Were they crazy? Was it Jack? Did he scream?
Y-j-just relax, nobody shouted. Jack just called to make sure of that
Thank God.
Yes, she is fired.

... DUMB, DRUNK, BITCH !!! Thank you thank you.
Hey, here's a question; Where did you get the finest oak east of the Mississippi?
Uh-huh, first you tell us where you have the most beautiful tip in the country.
I read your ad.
Looks good, right?
Yes.
Breathtaking entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
Oh my god, you are selling the entertainment center?
Why? I love this thing.
You want it?
Oh no.
Ahh, Gepeto, $ 5,000 dollars? Are you crazy?
Hey, the ad costs $ 300!
Alright, I change it to $ 50 or your best offer.
What kind of profit is that ?! And you call yourself an accountant.
No.
Oh. How are you?

That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment!
And you can see me!
Like yesterday, like the day before.
Is he already doing his shark attack?
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword puzzle before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six letter word for red?
Dark red.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots for you later. Hey, how about chestnut brown?
Yes, you are so smart!
Aww, you are so cute!
I know.
Okay, see you tomorrow morning.
OK.

Hello?
What about her?
I dont know.
But hey, I know, we can decide.
Okay, I'll ask you questions and you answer quickly.
OK?
OK.
What do you like better action or comedy?
Action.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Dude, you are sick.
Oh, I am sorry. I forgot you had this whole Rachel thing.

I mean, that's incredible.
I know. That's really, very big.
No it is not. It's small. It is tiny. It's small. It's small.
Nuh-uh. I do not think any of our lives will ever be the same again.
OK, is there a dumb button on this woman?
More than just jewelry.

Hello! I am Dr. Drake Remoray and I have some routine questions to ask you.
"Really?" I have with Dr. Wells had to deal with.
I know, but I'm a neurologist.
And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells gave a more complete overview of your status, so he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman.
That was a test. Good answer. Alright, full name.
Clifford Burnett.
Date of birth?
16th of November
Older?
Can not you find that out on my date of birth?
I am a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
I am 33.
OK. And you are married.
No.
Really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have engagement issues?
Are all questions so personal?
Yes.
Well, if you need to know that I'm a widower.
Oh, that's awful. I'm really sorry.
Yes.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
No.
Kramer Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance, did they?

Hello! Guys, I'm writing a vacation song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Pheebs, that's great!
Oh yeah!
But you know, um, Rachel does not rhyme on Draddle.
I know, but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Many things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. E-mail. Jail. Deposit. Able to. Maypole.
Everything good. Thanks. Do you have a nickname like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Did not your dad call you pumpkin?

OK.
Okay, I can do that.
I can tell her how I feel.
Just uh, just get up.
Take a few deep breaths.
Look self-confident.
Joey? How are you?
I uh, I just came over because I - I want to talk to you about something.
Okay, what's up?
What I do manages to create an atmosphere of support for the people who work with me.
Aha. Nice step on the do-do-thing by the way.
The hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
You have to go!
Oh!
Okay, do not worry. You are ready.
"Really?"
Absolute! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
OK.

Well, Mom, everything is fine, really.
Yes, Ross is great.
He is uh, he is in a very different place.
No, he is gone.
No, no, you do not really have to fly back.
What do you think, that could be your only chance?
Would you stop?
I'm only 26, I do not even think about babies.
Where have you been?
Oh, I only had one baby.
Mazel tov!

Oh wow! I should go. I have a date tonight.
Oh yeah! With who?
You know this girl I told you about who lives in Poughkeepsie?
Yes.
Not her.
Yeah, that's somebody else I meet and I - I can not decide between the two.
You know, those from Poughkeepsie, though she's a two-hour train ride away, are really pretty, very smart and - and a lot of fun.
But this other girl, well, she lives very close.
You know, she's, well, she's - she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's
If she's not having fun, why do you want to go out with her?
Well, I - I want to give her another chance, you know?
She lives so close.
And at the end of the appointment, another time, she - she said something that was - when she was joking, was very funny.
On the other hand, if she does not joke, she's not fun, she's stupid and a kind of racist.
Hello!
Hello!
Hey man!
Hello! Ooh, how was your first day at the restaurant?
Damn it!

Oh, there is a lot here.
Oh, I mean, she'll be waiting for him at the wedding and people will whisper, "Oh, this poor girl."
You know?
Then she has to come back and live all alone.
Oh dear God!
What?
There was a pregnancy test in the trash and it is positive. Monica is pregnant. I think she will not be all alone.

Hello.
Look, I'm sorry about the whole thing with Roger.
It really was not right and I and I want to make it right, so, um, I've brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy.
Well, that's just a loan.
OK?
I will, I will want him back.
So I will go now.
I'm sorry, I thought I could and I can not!

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Well, why do not I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor ?!
Hey, you want to do Joey a favor, maybe you're going out with Joey.

All right, ladies, here's what we'll do.
II want to be with her, I like her.
Oh that is good! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
Wait a minute, what will I do again?
Come on! Would you please be careful, I could wake up every moment!
Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No, no, that's not Joshua.
What do you want from me, I never met the guy.
Anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can not stay, but the rest of us have one

How do I look?
Oh, uh, I ... do not care.
Ok, now, remember, no trade.
You get the pretty, I get the mess.
Hello, Joey. Well, look what you have brought. Very nice.
... and what did you bring with you?
She checks the coats.
Joey, I'll wash the taxi smell of my hands.
Want to bring me a white zinfandel and a glass of red wine for Janice?
Janice?
Oh dear God.
Hey, it's Janice.

Well, okay, I have not worked through everything yet. Please do not tell Rachel, please?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although I'm the only one who knows about it, I feel special. OK!
Okay, stop it! Phoebe ?!
Hello revenge!
What was that?!
Sorry, screw up. Hey, how was the movie?
I have not seen it yet!
Well then you should hurry! The Angelika! Go! Go!
Nooooooo !!

Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Yes?
Uh, do you know how you talked about it the other day, how you did not come to London, and how you somehow feel excluded?
Yes?
Alright, we felt really bad, so we decided that we should all go on a little trip together!
Oh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where is the journey ?!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic in Central Park!
Yes, we all! The whole day!
That sucks!
This is not a journey!
I have just come from the park!
What are we doing in stupid Central Park?
"Well, it's right next to my house, all right!"
Well, I'll go home and enjoy the triumph of my idea in Central Park.
Hey-who-who-whoa !!
Ho-ho-stop for a second, Mr. Kissey!
You know, I wanted to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing that you did, and all I have to do is tell you that I'm very uncomfortable and I - you know - stop it!
I just tried to bring a little bit of culture into the group.
That's okay, just do not put it in my mouth.
Make me suck!

Is she in there?
Yes. She's bringing her down now, that's her.
Oh, it's alright.
I guess I'm done with the whole dating thing right now.
There is one more thing in my life that is suddenly completely different.
That is hard.
Yes I know.
On the other hand, in about seven months, you'll have something that you'll love more than any guy you've ever dated.
Just wait.
Wait till er, wait until your baby grabs your finger for the first time.
You have no idea.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Do you want, do you want to get coffee?
Oh no, I think I'll go home and eat ten candy bars.
Hey, I thought I had cheered you up.
Oh you have it, here are twenty.
Law. Good night.
Good night.

Hello
Hello! Hello mother.
This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you have pearls of wisdom?
Jack?
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
That's a good question, Dad. That's a good question
Hmmm .
Congratulations, you two!
Thanks, we are so excited
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
What? What?
Look at this clown!
Just because he has a bigger boat, he thinks he can take the whole river.
Get out of the way Jackass!
Who calls her boat Coast Guard at all?
The
What are you doing out here? The coast is over there.
Hello!
Hello! Listen! That's incredible! Joey holds his breath for almost four minutes!
Buddy! What are you trying to kill me ?!

Ow!
Really?! Well, it's like the other's apartment. It has rooms, walls and ceilings.
Well, I just wanted to see where you live. Now give me the tour.
Oh dear God! Oh dear God!
Ah, that's the living room.
Impressive.
Well. This is the kitchen.
Oh, that's really nice. Wait, can not I see the bedroom?
The bedroom. Well, it's pretty much your typical ... bedroom.
We are still on this side of the door.
Um-hmm.
Yes, but I have not seen it.
Oh, shoot! Maybe next time. Thank you for a nice evening.
So, um, who was she?
Oh, that was the blind date I told you about, called her up and changed it to today.
Did you like her? And I only ask as a friend, because I'm completely right.
Well, you seem to be fine.
Well, I do not think so, you know.
No, no, no, I would not do you myself, I mean, that would be weird.
Yes, no, I will bring one of the other girls.
Oh, that will be so much fun!
Hello!
Are you excited?
Yes! Hey, are Monica and Rachel working there?

Ok, so now we need white twigs and the sacramental wine.
All I have is oregano and a
Um, that's fine! OK. Well. Now we need the seed of a just man.
Okay, Pheebs, you know, if we had that we would not do the ritual at all.
Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok, yes, ok. Oh ok.
Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's Boxer Shorts.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Hey, he's wearing a sweater.
No.
Ohhh!
And here we have the last of Paulo's Grappa.
Hey, Rachel, the stuff is not nearly pure ...

Mona? Okay, if I was a salmon shirt, where would I be?
I am so sorry that I poured wine over your shirt.
Oh that's okay.
No, it is still wet.
You know what?
Let me know before it goes down.
Ooh, I have something you can carry.
Here.
Oh, um, I - I do not know if I want to wear a women's shirt.
No, that's a men's shirt.
It is awfully pink.

Oh, it's perfect!
What about you?
It is a kitchen slash bathroom.
Okay, I see what you say. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! Do you think we could get a bath in our kitchen?

Hello!
Let's do the show!
Okay, let me just have a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's so close.
Closer than here?
Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skaddle.
Wait, I will not just drink anybody's old coffee.
Okay, your Highness.
Um, Rachel, I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you want to get together again? Yes OK. Did someone else hear that ?!

How did you know that I was here?
Your mother called me. So is she?
No, that's a lender.
I'm sorry that you did that yourself.
I was not alone. I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper. So, did you see who won the game?
Yes, the Knicks at 10. They suck.
Yes, they are not that bad.

I'm sorry I can not make it to your imaginary wedding, but it's me
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I did not want him to yell at me as if I was a Latour of 74.
It is Lafite. The '74 Latour actually drinks quite nice.
Right here he comes. I will do that, I will tell him, I will be strong.
I just called a friend of mine.
Yes?
I think that maybe I can book
Really?!
What is it honey?
There will be no wedding. Ross and I will not marry.
What?!
I'm sorry, dad.
I do not believe that !!
Oh, Dad, stay calm. You're welcome.
Stay calm?!!
How do you expect me to stay calm ?!
That's unacceptable Rachel!
And I want to know why? !!
Is it because the Punk-Ross will not marry you ?!
That's it!
Is that it?
!
Yes. Yes, he says I am a damaged product.

So, you're like a zillionaire?
And you are our age. You are our age.
Do you know what you want, you should buy a state and then just call it after you.
What about Pete Dakota?
Yes, or, or, or, Mississippi.
Oh, oh, I have it! Pete-Chicago.
This is not a state Joe.
Oh, and Mississi-pete is?
I have to go, well, I'll see you later.
OK.
You are our age!
So, we are tomorrow?
Absolute!
Now get out of you !!
Okay, I'm going out of places where I can touch him!
Look, is something wrong with me?
I mean, why am I attracted only to people in which there is no future?
Either they are too old or they are too young, and then there is Pete, who is crazy about me, and who is absolutely perfect for me, and there is something going on!
I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?
!
No.
Okay, I'll get Frank.
So we walk down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's hang out with Totally Nude Nudes," you remember?
And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "No, let's just hang out with you." Well, that was a nice move stupid ass.

Yes, I think it was better if you were sad. Hey, um, do you remember the Roller Blades?
Do you know what else I miss?
"I am Monica.
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
Even when people are on it! "
"Hi, I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'll wash it better and make it smaller!"
"I'm Monica, I do not get any telephone messages from interesting people, always!"
Hello! I'll call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
"Oh my god, I can not find a friend!
I think I'm just stumbling down the hall and sleeping with the first guy I find there! "
Yes, we should be on the way if we want to make these reservations for dinner.

Article J437-A, color: winter berry.
Hi hmm, listen, come here, come in.
I'm so sorry about yesterday.
I'm really sorry.
It's just me
Listen Ross, you do not have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
They do?
Yes, you still have feelings for me.
And - to be honest, I - I still have feelings for you.
And I wish we could do it for Ross, but we can not.
It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just did not want to be.
Oh god, you're right.
Ross, we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'll leave. Can I? Remember you?
No.

I tell you, if you want to take care of this thing, you should go to my herbalist.
Thanks, but I want to remove it from Pheebs. I do not want to make it spicy.
You know, when girls sleep with guys with strange things on their bodies, they tell their friends about it.
Give me that.
Hello! Okay, do not be mad at me, but I could not resist.
Brides magazines?
Yes, and I know you would say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry. How great would you look if you walked along the corridor in this Donna Carin.
Oh, you would do that too! Oh, you should get that anyway. How to clubbing.
It's so funny, I know what I said, but this morning I was in bed, I imagined what it would be like to say yes.
I know it's a bit sudden, and it's a bit hurry, and it's not like I'm doing anything like that, but that does not mean I can not.
Law?
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it really made me happy.
Oh dear God.
I know. I need more cake.
Hey Monhm, if you marry, can I bring two guests?
You did not break up with the firefighter?
No, that was my way of telling you.
Well, it turns out that he is incredibly sensitive, he keeps a diary and he paints.
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew from me.
Impressive!
Yes, well, he would prefer watercolor, but you know, he has easy access to a lot of coal.
So, will you unload Jason?
Well, because I have to break up with someone, and okay, Jason is sensitive, but now it's Vince Plus too, Vince has the corpse, you know?
So it's all about math.

Ok, it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
All right, look! Enough is enough!
No, I just have to have two more points to beat him!
Monica, that was true too
I can not just leave! I tricked in four hours!
But...
Appearance!
You knew that about me when you married me!
You have agreed to take me into illness and health.
Well, that's my illness!
Oh yes, yes, the lobster.
Yes, I mean, I was sick all night.
Yeah me too, all night.
Really?! Why did not we cross each other?
Yes, well, because I stayed in my room. Yes, you do not want to look in my basket.

I can not believe that there is a naked whore!
Waiting! Waiting! Maybe she is a hooker
Yes, okay, let's leave the two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones do, I will not do it with some random guy!
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to it!

So.
So.
I just thought that we should both hang out a bit.
I mean, you know, we never really talked.
I suppose you knew that, even though you're one of us, right?
I know, I probably should not even tell you that, but I'm pretty intimidated by you.
"Really?" Me?
Yes.
Oh my god, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and it's likely that I'm totally paranoid, but somehow I feel like you might not do it.
Well, you are not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, uh, when you and uh Ross started going out, it was very hard for me, um, for a lot of reasons that I will not bore you now, but um, I just see how happy he is, you know, and how well you are together, and uh, Monica always says how nice you are, and God, I hate you if she's right.
Many Thanks. Hey, listen, would you ever want to go into a movie?
Yes, that would be great. I would love it.
I would love it too. Shoot, I have to go. Well, I'll talk to you later.
All right, Julie.
Bye.
Bye. What a manipulative bitch.

Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice, but I'll go with the one I picked first.
Oh my god Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
What?
A guy bought it. I'm so sorry. I'm tired of stopping, but they put me in jail!
They take you to jail?
The little prison between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, I'm sorry! But you know, this ring is better! Monica has never seen the other ring.
Yes, but when he made an application to me with the ring, I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.
It was the ring!

No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'll just - I'll just break it off with her.
No no no no no no. I mean, do not do that. Not, I do not mean for myself.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adaptation.
Thanks, Bernice. Let's go this weekend.
Oh, Barry ..! Come on, that's how it is ..
We can, we can go to Aruba!
When I was there, what our honeymoon would have been, uh ... it was really nice.
You would have liked it.
I had a bra.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
Alright, Miss Green, everything looks good ... Yes, I think we're seeing real progress here.
What?!
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.

Oh dear God! What does it matter?
Oh, that's an eye-removal machine.
Alright, I'm out of here!
I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding!
Hello!
That's how it was done!
Nearly! But first we have to start.
OK.
This is a glaucoma test.
Uh-huh.
Sit down.
OK.
But your chin here. Now you will feel a little breath in every eye.
What?!
A little breeze, come on!
Of course, now I'm scared.
No, we can go together! But do not wait too long, okay? Because I'll be out sometime before Friday.
Yes, but I do not want to die!
No, no, it will be fun! We can come back and we can follow these people!

Um, Chandler, Ross, that's Robert.
Oh hello.
Hello.
Hello.
You have lipstick right here. That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
Hello!
Hello!
Hey Hey Hey. So what happened? A forest is ticking you out?
No, you know, we always say we need a post office.
Yes!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
You build a post office?
No, an entertainment device, with a postcubby built directly into it. It is a one-day job, max.
OK. My word! They are cozy.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
The chainsaw came away from me somehow.

Hello!
Another cheesecake came! You have returned it to the wrong address!
Just bring it down, what's the problem?
I can not seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate a whole cheesecake two days ago and want more?
Well, I forgot how it tastes, okay ?!
It was cheesecake.
It was nice.
It had a buttery, crumbly Graham Cracker crust, with a very rich but light cream cheese filling Wow!
My whole mouth is filled only with saliva!
You know what? Forget it!
Yes, and we will set it down below so we will not be tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go for lunch?
Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

This one is from me.
Ahh!
It was not on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
A scooter!
Stay with the list. Always stay with the list.
No! No, no, I love it. Many Thanks.
Okay, open our next one. Open our next!
OK.
Now that you are a couple, are not we getting two presents from you?
You gave me one for my last birthday
OK.
Happy Birthday Grandma!
It is better to go over the hill and then bury under it.
All our love Monica and Chandler.
That's funny, yes!
No no no no! That was the joke!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
No, because you are not a grandmother!
No, I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I do not have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.
All you had to do was buy the card!

Hey, Joey. What's happening?
Delete the tracks for the Boobie Payback Express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Joey !! What the hell did you do ?!
We are sorry. False boobies.
Hello, Joey.
Oh! ... Hi sweetheart.

Man. Can you believe that he only had sex with a woman?
I think it's great. You know, it's cute, it's romantic ...
"Really?"
No, are you kidding? The guy is a freak ..
Hey buddy.
Hello.
Oh, that's attractive.
Oh, I thought you were great in the silence of the lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All in all, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me exactly, which part was the fun part? Where is my puck?
Oh, ah- the child has it.
The child...? Sorry, that's my puck.
You have to do it, man.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever - can not do it. Listen, um, give me back my puck.
"Yes", how about? C'mere. Give me!
Hello! Hello! No rough stop in my emergency room!
GIVE ME MY PUCK !!
...Now
Oh, look, wish me luck!
What for?
I will get one of these job stuff.

Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. This is good right?
You ordered a stripper for the shower ?! That is completely inappropriate!
What? He will be dressed like a baby! Oh hello Mrs. Green!
Hello!
I'm so glad you can do it.
Yes, thank you. And again, we are so sorry. We could not feel worse.
To attempt. There is my little girl.
She is still angry.
Yes I know. Is not it great? One less person we need to talk to.
Phoebe, Sandra is also mad at you. It - it does not bother you?
Oh, that's very - really very - very okay.
Julie's cervix is ​​seven inches wider, that's four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
Did you feel Rachel's uterus Ross?
No, I do not think we will do that.
We will not do that.
Well, if you like, you can feel Rachel's and then compare mine.
Am I disrupting?
Er, yes! Many Thanks.
Oh. Oh do not wait.
Later.
No-no-no! Do not leave me with these people here.
Oh, I am sorry.
No horse! Horse! Horse! My child does not have a father!

Try to feed her again.
I already fed her.
I know, that's why I said it again!
Okay, people, we can not turn on, okay? That's exactly what she wants.
Hello.

Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could need me on such short notice! Oh.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?
First of all, because you forgot to throw a bridal party.
And then forget to invite you.
Do you already have it?
Yes.
Well, we all called your phone book and a lot of people came, but it took so long to get you here - they had to leave.
Yes, we wanted to give you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you have none.
We ruined everything.
Pooh
Well, wait a minute, that's not true!
No, that was, that was really cute.
And it works somehow for the best.
What do you mean, what do you mean?
Well, now I can take a shower with the only people I really love!
I mean, I get all these presents without having to talk to people I do not even like!
surprise
Sur-surprise.
Monica.

I can not believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair !!!
Well, on the bright side, now you do not have to look all these paleontologists out with their shirts.
Not you people.
You did it!
So what are we doing today?
You have a games room on the ground floor! Ping Pong and such.
Table tennis? Honey, they have table tennis! Let's play!
I do not think so!
Why not?
Because you know how competitive you are and well, I say it's cute, others contradict and I'm lying!
I am not always so bad!
Oh,
I beat you ...?
And...?
... Phoebe ...?
... and...?
I rolled up your heads!

I'm sorry, ah, I scared you there.
Oh, that's okay. By the way, I have just checked the shower massager.
Yes.
Hello!
I tried to reach you at work. There was ... a fire.
What?! Oh my ... Oh my god !! What happened?!
Well, we believe it originated here. In the aroma room.
Well. Did everyone come out?
Well, the giraffe is okay. And so is the pirate.
Ohh. What's this?
No Phoebe, do not look! You do not want to see what's in there !!
Oh, those - the Foster dolls!

Hello.
Hello! How long does it take to Petes fight?
Oh, about five minutes. At the moment they are interviewing his opponent. Apparently, he trains by going to Iran and taking the thieves off his arms.
Hot dog?
Four, please. I am really nervous. Many Thanks.
So Ross, how is Bonnie?
What?
Oh!
I have to tell you, I - I did not expect to like her at all, I mean, I did not really expect to like you, but she's really great.
Oh that's a shame!
No, I - I said I liked her.
Yes, you know, there are other fish in the sea.
Pheebs, I think she's great. OK? We go out again.
Okay, I hear you! Can you talk about something else?
Hello! Which is my turkey burger?
Ahh, the one beside my foot. We are sorry.
Hey, the fight is starting!
Okay, we'll be right over. So, did your boss try to beat you again today?
Nine times!
Okay, I had to cream myself!
But everything will be fine, because tomorrow I'll do an experiment, and if everything goes as planned, my butt will be no problem.
The fight is over!

Okay, okay, here it comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who does not want to marry?
Yes! And also a bit like a Frenchman. I never noticed that before.
Hi Guys!
Hello!
Hello!
What you up to?
Oh, just hang out, talk about the websites.
Yes, we have seen this really interesting website about marriage and how completely unnecessary it is and how it is just a way for the government to keep an eye on you.
Yes, Big Brother.
Well, that's a little crazy. Although I am glad to hear that you are concentrating on what you see on the internet.
Yes, now you know, it just made me think, why would anyone ever want to marry?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To consolidate your commitment! To declare your love for each other in the world!
Eh
Okay, that's good to know.
Mr. Bowmont is here !!!

Oh, that's great, my friend Joey is in the movie business.
Do you know who I met from school? Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently Howie is working now.
Yes, he-he-he calls me and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
Can you belive that?!
You know, I have not talked to him in ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yes, I always hated that Howie.
No, no "How are you?" Man, I do not even mean a cup of coffee!
The nerve, right?
Yes!
Refill?

Hello! How are you?
Well! Good, not seen for a long time.
Yes.
Like your sweater.
Oh hey, right back to you.
Oh, it's crazy about Rachel, huh?
Yes. She - well, she is a crazy woman?
So, whose is it?
Um, I do not have an Italian. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
OK.
He is so funny.

Want to fool around with Joey?
Yes!
You know, since I had this dream of him and can not get it out of my head anymore!
And what's the big problem, people do it all the time!
Who? Who do you know who are friends who just fool around?
Ok, from my head ... Don and Janet.
Who, who are they?
I know her from work.
Both?
No, one of them ...
Which one?
I do not know, what were the names I just said?
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
Alright, you're right
What the hell are you cooking?

Oh dear God! How did you come back here ?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hello, Officer Firefighter, can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the garbage pit.
This is not mine.
Yes it is.
How do you know?
The next time you want to throw a fire alarm into a garbage shaft, do not wrap it in a blanket that says, "Phoebe Buffay's property is not Monica."
Okay, do you have - Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked it was America!
Please connect again, it is against the law to separate them.
Fine! But please, God. Tell me how I can stop you from going away!
Under the plastic cover is a reset button.
There is a reset button?!
Oh, thanks!
Many Thanks!
There is a reset button!
My God!
Why did not I see that?
Reset button, reset button, where is a reset button?
Oh, here it is!
Oh!
Oh God!

Four letters: "Circle or Hoop".
Ring damn, ring!
Many Thanks.
Hey, do you know that our phone is not working?
What?!
I tried to call you from the cafe and there was no answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I have switched it off!
Just like you told her! ... just show the irony.
Hey, so listen, I crossed the street and talked to the bouncer - I have the name of the peeper! Can I use the phone?
Nngghhh !!!!!!!
Can I use your telephone? Yes, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heater."
Cooler.
Five letters.
Rdtor.
Yes, is Sidney there? Oh that is? Sidney is a woman.
Well, you have to wait until it's your turn.
Well, how long do you think it will be?
Every moment.
Hey, that- Heyy ...

Hello.
Hello! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Ooh, it's probably a remainder check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda.
"Benefits expire."
Hmm that's weird. I can not remember that I fell for a move called Benefits.
Okay, it's not a check. You say your health insurance has expired because you did not work enough last year.
Let me see that!
Well.
Oh, I can not believe that!
That sucks!
If I had insurance, I could be hit by a bus or lit, you know?
And it would not matter.
Now I have to be careful?
!
I'm sorry, man, there's never a good time to stop catching fire.
Well, I think I have to get a job. I will see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look in both directions before you cross the street.
look in both directions before crossing the street.

I can not believe that Phoebe will get her babies!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Do you know what else I can not believe?
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel each time I left a room, I mean, it's a pity they did not see us having sex.
Do you know something about women?
No.
Is okay.
OK.

Do you remember when we drove to Central Park and rented boats? That was fun.
Yes. He could row like a Viking.
Hello.
Mmm.
So, how did it go?
Oh, you know ..
Did he mention us?
He said he would really miss you.
You had a hard day, huh .. c'mere.
...I love you.
Are your hands still wet?
Uh, wet, yes.
Let's dry it again.

Oh dear God! Oh dear God!!
Still crying?
As a
You know, I only know two surefire ways to silence a man. And one of them is sex.
What is the other?
I do not know, I never had to use the other one.
I'm just saying, you know, if we have sex, he will not talk.
Oh, that's right.
You are the speaker.
Anyway, great idea!
Um, I have to go to the store; I told him that I would buy him more handkerchiefs.
Oh, we have some
No you do not!

Okay, yes. Triple A can pick us up.
Great!
Yes, in which city are we in the vicinity?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Why do you answer? At least you know which route we are on?
Yes, we are definitely on Route 27.
OK. We're at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
I do not know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we pulled up here.
OK.
Hey, can you send someone up and down 76 and check every rest area, and 93?
OK!
Yes, no, they do not.
Uh, okay, now someone will come and rescue us.
Who?
I mean, have you seen a car in the last one and a half hours?
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can pick up a car and pick us up.
No! No, I do not go with Ross in a car, we just have to live here!
But if ...
No, people, I do not go in the car with him, you have to think of something else.
Oh well, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the help went well?
I tell you, man, I saw it.
Yes, well, you are wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm so sorry. Betting that barium enema does not sound so bad right now, right?

I know.
Let's take a look far from the amazement.
Okay, we - we'll look into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days ahead.
Chandler!
What's wrong with your face ?!
I mean, this picture should say "Geller and Bing are married", not "The local woman is rescuing drowning idiots!"
Hello!
Do not laugh at him!
He is
Aww!
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!

We will find love!
Certainly!
Yes, I'm pretty confident.
That makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
However, it would be nice to have a small guarantee.
What do you think?
Well, you know, some people do business with a friend, as if none of them were married when they are 40, they marry.
You mean a backup?
Exactly!
Yes, I understood that.
They do?
Hm-mmm.
Who?
Joey.
Joey?
Yes!
Are you serious?!
Yes, I locked him up years ago!
So if none of you are married until you're 40, you're going to marry Joey.
Yes, we shook. Yes, but believe me, he did not want to seal the deal.
Oh really?
Yes, what should I do?
Yes, I'm sorry, man. Do you want to watch?
Yes!

Good Morning.
Hello day! Hey, are you having fun with Joey last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the game Knicks.
Oh, that's nice.
Then we went to this bar and he connected us with all these women!
Where women? You mean like old women?
Well, a little old, like 30.
Oh.
And I've never been able to talk to the girls in bars, but I got 20 phone numbers last night.
That's great! Wow man, Joey must have really taught you some stuff, right?
A little bit.
Yes?
How are you'?

Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You are awesome!
I know.
So does it really hurt as much as they say?
What did you just say?
You throw another hard eighth and we marry here tonight.
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anyone so much as I loved you.
I've never loved anyone so much as I loved you.
Okay, when an eight comes, we take it as a sign and we do it!
Whoa!
Where have I heard this before?
Matthew Perry on signs in Las Vegas.
I think it must have been a movie I saw.
What are you saying?
OK!
OK! Come on! Let's go! Well!
OK! That's a four! And where - where is the other one?
It went under the table.
No movement! Okay, you look that way; I will look like this!
Well!
Here it is! Here it is!
That could be four or five. It is your call.
It is a four.
I agree.

That's it. I'm done. Angry! Here comes the meat sweats.
Well, Joey, we are all, we are all very proud of you.
Yes, I think we can expect a call from the President at any moment now.
Can we do something for you?
No, nobody pushes my stomach.
By the way, you can keep these pants.
Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what've you got there? What's this? Cake?
Yes, do you want something?
Ah, just cut a bit of splinters.
A bit bigger.
A little bigger.
What?!
Are you afraid that you will run out?!
Cut me a real piece!

Phoebe, oh my god! What are you doing here?
I have to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Oh dear God!
Of course, of course.
Um, would you excuse me for a moment please?
Um, do you know each other's hometowns?
Why do not you go wh-what's going on?
Well, um, not much.
But I just thought the guys got engaged, that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, you know?
So, could I just move in with you for a few days?
Um, okay, yes, sure. But what's up with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing, why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yes, that's it! I go to the cinema and it starts in five minutes.
Do you realize that I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, I am sorry. I am so rude. Does anyone want to come to the cinema?

Look, look, there has to be a way we can work on it.
Okay, I can not imagine, I can not imagine my life without you.
Without, without those arms and your face and this heart.
Your good heart Rach, and, and ....
No.
I can not, you're a totally different person for me now.
I always thought of you as someone who would never ever hurt me.
God, and now I just can not stop painting with her, I can not, it does not matter what you say or what you do, Ross.
It's just changed, everything.
Forever.
Yes, but that can not be, I mean.
How is it then?

The windows are clean, the candles are lit.
Uh, the belt is too tight, I have to change the belt.
Did I shoot the fish?
No, because I made lasagna.
Am I out of control?
Just a touch.
Mon, I do not understand it.
I mean, you were with this guy, since how, what ... his midterms?
I mean, why are you suddenly so ... Oh.
What?
Could tonight be the night?
I dont know.
Look, he's a great guy and I love to be with him, but ... you know.
Things happen and they happen.
You do not plan these things.
So, did you shave your legs?
Yes.
Aha!

Horse!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
Okay, Raymond, Joey, you're done.
Hello!
Okay, well, let's try it. Whenever you are ready.
Oh oh.
There is a problem?
Well, that's noodle soup and I worked with tomato.
But that's fine, no problem.
No problem.
Hmm, noodle soup.
You know, that's - that's good, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
How is it different? Oh! Yes!
Okay, let's try it.
Hmm, noodle soup.
OK. Let's do that again.
OK.
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
COME ON!!!!
You know what? We have to continue.
No! No! II can do it again! See? Appearance! Hmm, noodle soup. Damn it!

OK. Give us only one second. Horse!
Yes?
Give her some money.
I really think they do not have rooms anymore.
You are not!! Ross, you save them only for the important people !! OK?! What-what if I was the president ?!
Well, then we would be in big trouble, you do not know where countries are.
OK.
Um, say, would you do it? Would you mind checking to see if any private rooms are available?
This is a hospital.
OK.
You know what?
I have to say that I really do not care about your tone.
And that's not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem about whoa!
Oh God!
Whoa!
What what?
Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Yes, it could not hurt to look.

All I'm saying is, when dogs experience jet lag, then, for the whole er, seven dog years to a human year, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, not only does he lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
This is funny. Who are you?
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman she touches is her ... close, personal friend.
You mean, they are lovers.
If you want to put a label on it.
Wow, um, anything else I should know?
Oh God, Ross, I can not do that.
Okay, fast and painful.
Oh god ... okay. Alright. Alright. OK. Ross, please do not hate me.
Oh what? What what?
Do you know Marcel?
...Yes?
Well, I ... somehow I lost him.

Hello Pheebs!
Hello!
How are you?
Well.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were at the coffee shop, did we decide to keep the phone, the sweet guy's phone?
Yes.
And remember, as I said, that I would keep it in my purse so that if it rang, I just could pick it up?
Yes!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone ?!
Ooh, now you have lost me.
You stole the phone!
No I did not!
No? So you say, if I call it, would not it ring?
No. Um, okay. But while you choose, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it works!
Phoebe!
It is not here.
Puzzler. A little bit like a puzzle. Why not, um, look into the copy room, maybe you have the contracts in there?
How could I have left her in the copy room?
I do not know, day! How can your genitals talk on the phone? OK? It is not a perfect world! Just go.
Fine.
Many Thanks. Hello? I still do not understand.

How are you'? Welcome. Nice to see you!
This will be your phone.
That's great. But I do not really expect many calls.
No, you answer it and take pledges.
But I am the host!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You will answer the phones.
You do not seem to understand. I was dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here is your telephone doctor.

Hi Guys.
Hey Günther. Hello. I mean, you go upstairs with the noisy guy?
Well, he is very charming.
I know he is too charming, but when you both go out it will be much harder for me to hate him.
Well, you'll just have to try.
Joey, where are they?
I do not know, Chandler should lead her around ...
Phew, close.

Oh!
Look, what happened!
Hope not, boys, we only see them from behind or from the neck.
In times like these, I wish the networks would send a different nudity than Denis Franz's butt.
Hello.

Okay, ten blocks away. Five to go.
Oh, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh, I am sorry! Need a break?
My boots in tan! Hello! Can you come a little closer so that I can see the price?
I can see it from here. It costs you a husband.
Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can go the rest of the way now. Just give me my boots.
Come on!
Oh God!
Yes, you like that, right?
Oh yes, right there!
You want it there? You take it baby!
Uh Phoebe?
Yes, say my name. Say it! And now I'll cover you again, and we'll never do that again.

Happy?! Should I be the Vic? Happy?
Well, why do not you tell me what you should be?
Huh?
Because I can not fucking find out!
I'm talking to you and it's nothing.
You look at me, and nothing.
Nothing.
You people let me fly! High! Okay, we'll pick it up tomorrow.
Well, that was ah ...

What?! What do you do?!
Do you know what just happened?
Yes. We - we had sex and then we fell asleep.
No. We were in the middle of sex and
No no! No, that is not true. No, best time ever! Yes, you rocked my world!
Do not worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Hey guys, I'll go out and go for a walk.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Oh, it is not!
Seriously, it moves!
What the hell is in there?
It's just my knitting, that's all! Yes! I knit that. I'm very good.

There will be a time in each of your careers if you have the chance to beat up another soap opera actor.
I had such an opportunity in the last, present.
And I am ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a homosexual role.
Yes, we both auditioned for the role, and um, as it turned out, ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and occupied it.
And now he's got a two-year contract with Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me, I'm stuck here, teaching a lot of people, most of them too ugly to even be on TV.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Many Thanks.

Rach?
I'm going right now.
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I uh Boy I'll tell you that it's such an honor to be nominated for a nomination
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
in reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank you, Neil. Thanks for the words.
Okay sweetheart, you can finish this later, we'll be late. We must go.
Please, do not play the music. Only one more.

I can not believe you do not want to know.
I mean, I could not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows ....
And Monica knows ...
What, you know, I do not even know!
Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
So, what will it be?
Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh great, now he knows, and I do not know!
I'm sorry, I'm just excited to be aunt!
Or an uncle ...
Hey Phoebe!
Hello Pheebs!
Pheebs!
Fine!
Phoebe, what's up?
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm not okay.
Oh, right, that's me!
Hey, Chandler, this table closes at 7, come on.
Fine.
Phoebe, what is it?
Alright, do you know Paolo?
I know his work, yes ...
Well, he made a move on me.
Whoa, store is open tomorrow!
More coffee here, please!

Hello.
Hello. What are you doing here?
Well, I - I've been thinking a lot about what you said, and um, I realized it, well, maybe I was a bit judgmental.
Yes, oh, but oh ...
Look, Phoebe, remember, hey, they've just met their Christmas ...
Fate.
For sure.
Yes.
Well.
OK. Yikes! That does not look very satisfied.
Oh, that's, ah, one of the old ones, he just takes it backwards.
You keep the old ones in the back, that's so old-fashioned.
Well, we have to make room for the fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old guys?
Well, they are going to the hacker.
Why do I have a feeling that is not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo !!!
Hello! Hello!!

Light still off?
Yes.
Oh. Maybe they are crazy.
Oh please, they have sex.
Shut up!
So, what do you think, is George?
I think he is shy.
Yes?
Yes. I think you have to pull it out. And then - if you do - he is a neat animal.

Hello! Hi, I'm Ross, you do not know me, but I'm a big, big fan of you. I mean,
Are not you with the girl over there?
Well, yes, somehow.
Um, but that's okay, we understand, um, we all have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you.
No, no, no, it's flattery.
I'm so sorry.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
Not, do not apologize so quickly.
I mean, this is a unique opportunity ...
Yes for you. Is this the list?
HM Yes.
Can I see it?
Eh, no.
Come on!
But okay.
I'm not on the list!
Um, you see, but that's not the final draft.
It is laminated!
Yeah, um, okay, you were, you were on the list, but my friend, Chandler picked up on the very good point that you're international, so I kicked you for Wynona Rider on the ground.
You know, it's ironic ...
What?
... because I have a list of five stupid coffee house types and yesterday I came across you for that guy over there.
We will only be friends.

Get out of here, you are lurking! Go on! Receive!
Hey Pheebs!
Ohh! You invented it!
Yes, I could not be mad at him for too long.
Yes, she could not live without the Chan Love.
Oh, get a room.
We have a.
I know. Use it.

Oh, listen, I have to ask!
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now he's doing that with lots of girls?
Yes much. Very much!
Ohh! And I am one of them !! Impressive! Oh, I can not believe it! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, you know, it's none of your business, but are not you married?
Yes. Oh, I just wish we could not be married a little bit! You know, I just wish we could be in a break!
Horse! I think she's trying to make something happen to you to get me back!
That's the only reason she could be here, right?
It may not have anything to do with the fact that - that maybe I am a good listener and I umh one
Ross, I tell you she uses you to get me back!
You know what?
I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.
Whoa!
Uh, that was your sister.
She - she thinks you only use me.
So?

I'm so sorry.
What are you doing here?!
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
What?!
Um, okay, okay, look.
I took this picture from your fridge.
Okay, because I know that's my dad.
Yes, that's Frank Buffay and you're right next to him.
Well, look, I deserve to know where I'm from.
Well?
So if you can help me find my father, then you should do it!
Otherwise you are only mean!
So just tell me the truth!
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My father is Chuck Magioni?
No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I sold him a house last year!
And I'm very sorry, but I do not know where your father is, and that's the truth.
Oh.
But um, you're right.
I think that a person should know where they come from.
W-why I ah, ahh, okay.
I am your mother.
Huh?
You know, I wanted to tell you yesterday, but somehow I felt dizzy and ...

What happens to your accent?
Come back?
What's that nonsense?
All right, I'm - I'm not English.
I'm from Long Island.
I was really nervous and the accent just came out.
I'm so sorry.
Well, if we could just go back to the lecture.
Um, were there any questions?
About paleontology.
Ok, I just wanted to make a good first impression.
Obviously I messed up.
But what you think of me is really important, because I hope to get a steady job here.
So, if you give me just one more chance to make a good impression
Horse !! Are you crazy?! I am
Well, hello Rachel!

Where are you going, Joe?
For a walk.
Oh. Do you mind if I join you?
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really have to sort out my thoughts.
Her thoughts? Plural?
Alright, I have only one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I have to see her!
I'm afraid I can not let you do that, Joe.
Now you tell me I can not see her ??
You kill me!
It is forbidden fruit!
It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stableboy ... why are you doing this, huh?
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
Yes, in fact he did, so I can not let you go.
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. That's the kind of stuff that makes great novels.
Great novels?
Fine ... mediocre porn

Okay, I think we can get the review back before they see it, but we have to go to Mr. Zelner's office.
Now he's only getting in at ten, so he's not a problem, but his assistant Betty comes early to have breakfast at her desk.
That's a bit sad.
Yes, Betty is somehow sad. That's why I think I can lure her with these chocolates. Now while I distract her,
I have it!
Here we go!
Hello Rachel, do you have a minute?
Yes, sure, Mr. Zelner, for you, something. OK. Fine. Cancel the plan, cancel the plan.
Uh, actually I want to talk to you both.
OK. Uh, can we, can we tell you something Herr Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Cassie, do you think everything is alright there?
Yes! Thank you for the permission to stay here.
Oh! No problem! I
What?

You are iron.
You are steel!
Let me ask you something, how come, when I call your computer support line, do I have to wait an hour and a half?
I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Can we concentrate on my training?
I mean, why of all people would you like to go out with Chip ?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools ...
Okay, that does not help me because we went to the same high school.
You've gone to where you've been, and you've got to ride Chip's motorcycle and wear his letterman's jacket.
I went to one where I wore a band uniform that they had custom made.
They had to have done extra?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my god, they told us that was for the mascot!
At that time I thought that I would never get the chance to go out with a chip Matthews, and now he is - he has called me and asked me.
And the fat girl in me really wants to go.
I - I owe her that.
I never let her eat.
Oh, you go out with him.
Really?!
Yes. Only if it is possible, could you leave him somewhere and have sex with another man?
I'll try it.

Hello! Great guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about the girl you dance with.
Yes, yes, okay.
Uh, look buddy, I came with this girl and I had this plan to kiss her at the countdown of the new years - I try to win her, so I wondered if ..
Oh man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, gentle!
Well, I was hoping that I could know this tonight
Ross, get over it! It's not that she hates you.
Yes but
Ross, she's not funny, she just wants her stuff to be unique.
Huh. Do you know what is not unique? A twin!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Ooh, Phoebe is here! Okay, let's all the lights off and we'll watch the movie!
OK. Hey-ooh, cool sheets!
Oh, do you like it? Do you want to know where I have it?
For sure!
He has a flea market!
You bought your bedding at a flea market? Ross come on, you have to loosen the purse a bit.

And Joey?
What do you think she does?
Am I the only one who does not think she's hot? Horse?
Um, I mean, I think she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Many Thanks!
Now that Rachel has disappeared?
So hot that I cried myself to sleep last night.

Oh God, help us.
What?
Ugly naked guy laying kitchen tile. Ohhh!
Ohhh! Look, I ask for a favor. If I do that for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but I made a big mistake. I should never have quit with her. Will you help me? Sorry?

Honey, this morning was fun, was not it? I jump on you in the shower.
Yes! And maybe one day we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Look, Carol umm, I was, maybe I thought, um, maybe we can spice things up a bit.
What do you think?
Carol, our sex life is - it just does not work
Hey, little guy!
Hey, uh-hey, why do not you grab some shoes?
Hey, why do not you show daddy how to put on your shoes, in your room!
Yay!
!
Yay!
Yay!
Seriously, I thought of our sex life, maybe I do not know, we could try some new things.
You know?
For fun?
Like what?
Well, I do not know, um, what if we made each other too tight?
Um, some people eat each other stuff.
No!
Um, do you know us - we could try dirty talk?
Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
I love this idea!

Hey, Sophie!
So who was the idea to get everyone on skates in the diner?
Oh, an idiot customer has put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my god, they took my idea!
That was you?!
Yes! Okay, here you go.
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Are you all right?
Oh my.

Sit!
Hello.
Oh my god, Joshua!
All those things I said that I'm not ready
You are not true?
No, they are - they are all true.
Oh.
But
Oh! Oh, I love that.
Do you want to go in and have coffee?
Yes.
OK. Everytime.

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hey, you will not believe what I have to do for work today.
Yes, but, Ross you
What, Phoebe, have you whipped the potatoes? Ross needs lump!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just thought we could whip it and then add peas and onions.
Why should we do that?
Well, because then they would be the way my mother made her before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes are coming up.
Ok, goodbye, guys. Thank you for everything. Oh sorry! Oh sorry!
The most incredible thing happened. Underdog just got away.
The balloon?
No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Just before he reached
I can not, I have to go.
Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let go of the city. How often does this happen?
Hardly ever.
Do you have the keys?
OK.

What do you think?
Many things.
What do you think, is she?
May I help you?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to watch.
You do not watch a dance class. you
What does she mean?
I think she means "you"
Okay, tell anyone that you think I could be me?
People! The last time around were some empty yogurt containers after class. Let's not do that again!
She could be you.
Let's start. Five, six, one-five, six, seven, eight ...
Okay, I do not understand that!
I totally understand it!
Have you ever had the feeling that you are so incredibly uncoordinated sometimes?
What? They only click when they click.
Okay, people, everyone is now reaching for a partner.
OK. And, my, dead, mother, says it's you. I'm with Rachel.
Great. It's physical education again.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it never was.
No it was not.
Ooh, and it's so nice to have this little sink here ...

Oh, is not that nice? It's so quiet, I could spend the whole day here.
I know
Open your curtains! Open your curtains!
I'm so glad we have adjoining rooms!
The sun is shining!
Hello! Do you remember when I had corneas?
Okay, listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs and I get the magazines and the lotion.
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
No no!
Damn it!
The walls are pretty thin, guys!

Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all due respect, I would like to donate something.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Oh that's a shame. I somehow saved. Uh, are you sure there are no studies I can attend?
Well, here's a schedule for what's coming.
Many Thanks. Well, but it starts now.
Oh that's available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
But it's $ 2,000.
We are sorry.
Well, how about this? To test the impact of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
We have already achieved the results and they are not good.

Hello! How's it going?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes, it has! I made cookies!
Oh, that's alright. I'm still full of your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now because they are hot from the oven.
OK.
Ohh O! But not in here! Can not she eat in bed, remember? No crumbs!
Okay, I'll be right away.
OK!
What do you do?
That does not lock it?

You know, it still smells like monkeys.
This saves us a conversation.
Well, listen, that was great, but I am officially extinguished.
Me too, we should go.
No.
Oh. Mine does it.

Okay, here comes another camera.
Law. Not a big problem. Stay calm.
Why are you continuing this?
If we want to be in front of the camera, we have to get up on one of these platforms.
They filmed the people there all day.
Law.
Hey, what did you do to get up there?
Oh yeah? Well, when you learned to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Yes!
Hello! You're a great dancer!
"Really?"
Yes, well, you'd be better if you just relax your hips a bit.
What do you think?
Like this.
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
Uh-huh.
Okay, you're dancing with the girl over there.
No-No-No-No-No we came together!
I do not see it. You dance with the big guy over there. Big guy, raise your hand!
No, no, dude, please let me dance with the girl, I really like her and I think I have a chance.
Really, y'think like that? Not me..

Why are not you home yet!
Is someone there?
Oh yes, it's me! We are sorry!
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm just, I just look out of your window. At-by the view. What are you doing right now?
We have some
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Who? Is that your sister?
Oh, she
God, Ross is dating your sister! How strange is that ?!
Oh my god, look, he's undressing!
He takes off her coat!
Oh, that's just awful.
Horse! Waiting!
Elizabeth, thank God! I have just thought about it
You suck!!
What?!
Okay, the breakup is not finished!

Hello.
Hello.
Listen, I understand, if you came by to beat me, I deserve it.
No, I do not want to hit you.
Oh what then? Kick me?
No.
My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What are you doing here?
Well, the delivery went to you and I realized that they had forgotten that.
Ah, must have been pretty obvious, since it was the only thing in your business.
Listen, home delivery is really part of my job description.
Oh.
Oh, I came here to ask you.
Oh! Impressive! Oh yeah! That sounds good. I'll just put it back in my bag, pretend
For sure!
Horny slut. No! You are a horny bitch! Nope! You are the horny bitch! No! You are a horny bitch!

Shopkeeper !! You have the best taste in men!
Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had a great time last night! I mean, I think that could turn into something serious.
Really?! I - I thought you were not looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for a kind of fling.
Well, you know, maybe. You did not tell him that? Law?
Ummmmmmmmm, no.
You told the guy I'm looking for a fling ?! You do not tell that guy!
Why not?! I would love to hear that some hot girl is just waiting to get - oh I understand.
Oh, between you tell him I wanted to have an affair and I wanted to get off on the first date - oh, he's going to get such a wrong idea.

Okay, I'm back in high school, I'm in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize that I'm totally naked.
Oh yeah. Had this dream.
Then I look down and I realize there's a phone ... there.
Instead of...?
Right.
Never had this dream.
No.
Suddenly the phone rings.
And they did not look at you before ?!
Finally, I think I should answer better,

Honey! Dinner is ready!
What does my little cook have for me tonight?
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Yes! And a lot of it!
Thank you sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. OK.
Okay, let's go.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How are you'?

Something went wrong with Underdog, and they could not bring his head up.
Anyway, um, his head is falling down like Broadway, right, and I just think ... how inappropriate that is.
Um, I have something in my eyes, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Oh dear God.
What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like ... cocktails in the Appalachians.
Come on, they are close.
Shut down? She has her tongue in his ear.
Oh, how you never got a bit wild with Ross.
Joey, that's sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's not really true, is it?
Well, who says what's right? I mean...
Oh my god, what did you think?
Okay, look, I'm not proud of that, ok? Well, maybe I am a little bit.
Oh!
Ow!
I'm out of here.
Wait wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
"Really?"
Yes. I think if we put our heads together, we can split them up.

Hello! A marriage please!
Yes, we want to marry!
Well.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What do you do?
Oh that is
No, just because that's the final song.
OK! That's it! We are getting married!
Are you sure you want to do that?
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Waiting! OK!
Would you ever be a substitute for someone?
It depends on who asked.
What if I had asked?
Oh, Mon, sure.
"Really?"
Yes. You do not ask, are you?
No.
Yes! Total!
Oh! Many Thanks! Many Thanks! Many Thanks! Yes! Many Thanks!

You will not believe it! Joshua came to work today and guess what happened?
He asked you?!
No. But I showed him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Naughty!
What's this?
Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, okay, should I be scared?
I know switch is doing something, okay?
So I went to the city hall and got it.
I only had to pay $ 25 and wait three hours.
Impressive! If only more people knew.

Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all think. But Chandler is in
Yes! No, I thought so.
So I ask you, take a moment before you judge me.
Oh, nobody judges you.
Oh! OK! You, Mr. Right Place at the right time, call me!
Oh man!
I want this place so much !!
I was so sure it would work!
There are twelve dollars that I will never see again!
All right, sweetheart, we'll go better if we want to see the movie.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye Chandler! I miss you now.
Okay, did you see that ?! With the inappropriate and the pinch !!
Actually, I did it!
Okay, do you believe now that she is attracted to me?
Ohhh, oh my god! Oh dear God! She knows about us!
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows, and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for that!
Okay, but what about my sexy butt and my biceps? She knows!

Ross, Um, you've been there for a long time. I start to freak.
Okay, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn off the light?
No, let's just start the light.
Oh dear God!
Do you want to go now? Because I'll take you right now, mate! You want to go?
Oh good.
Ready? Rings!
Okay, you know, uh, that's great. That helps a lot. Many Thanks.

Well, remember, something big and long will be hard to maneuver, luckily I have a lot of experience in this area.
Can we concentrate here please, the life of a naked man is in balance!
I tell you that he is dead. What we will have here is a dead guy on the stick.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Okay, a little bit higher.
Beware of the angle.
Okay, okay, we're approaching the window. Thread the needle.
Thread the upper one.
He lives! He lives !!!
And yet we are still poking him.
Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
He does not look happy.
Hey-hey, now he shows us his poking device.
Hey, that will never work out, mate!

Well, they have uh, some unusual nicknames for each other.
Including Umm, nasty bitch and uh, sick bastard.
Oh god, oh!
Contraction!
Yes? OK.
Oh! Au !!
Are you looking at her ?!
No!
Do not you look at her, you sick bastard!
Honey, I swear it! I did not look at her!
She is in work! You like that sick son of a bitch!
Umm. Um, I'm - I'm just -
See? See? It was because you look so perverted!
No, no, I'm sure no one was looking for it. Just a little privacy.
You miss your girlfriend?
Just ignore it.
Horse.
What? What?
He looks at me.
Hello! Do you want to live to see your baby ?!
Do not you talk like that to my husband, you stupid bastard!

Pat Sajak?
Yes!
Alex Trebek?
Yes of course!
Chuck Woolery?
Certainly! Phoebe, you will not find a single Game Show host whose ass I can not kick.
Say it!
Say, we are unagi!
You are nothing! It's something you have!
Say it!
You know what? I can come out easily, but there is a chance that you can be very, very hurt!

Hey, Rach, I can borrow your eyelash shaper, I think I lost mine.
Yes, it is in there.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you shortly?
Oohh !! Ohh! Oh oh oh! Oh oh !!
Ohhhhhhhhh !!!!!!!
Yes. Yes.
You?! And - and you ?!
Yes, but you can not tell anyone! Nobody knows!
As?! When?!
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we did not tell anyone was that we did not want to make a big deal out of it.
But it's a big deal !! I have to tell someone!
No no no no no! You can not!
Sorry? You're welcome?! We just do not want to talk about it, okay? Just promise that you will not tell it.
Well! Man, that's incredible! I mean, that's it
I know, it's great!
Oh, I do not want to see that!
We are so stupid! Do you know what's going on there? They try to take Joey!

And my second grade teacher was Mrs. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Madam, Mrs. Gobb?
No Cobb, as in the Cobb salad.
Well, what exactly is in a Cobb salad?
Ahh!
What do we do? What do we do?
Um, um, we'll turn it over. Ducks or clowns.
Oh, we will shoot for the baby?
Do you have a better idea?
Alright, call it up.
Heads.
Heads it is.
Yes! Angry!
We have to give something to the heads.
Law. Ok, ok, um, ducks are heads because ducks have heads.
What kind of scary clowns came for your birthday?

Okay, a few tricks of the trade.
Well, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so when I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I'll cut a hole in my pocket, pick up tweezers, and just start pulling.
Or ah, or say, I want to convey that I've just done something bad.
That would be the basic "I have a hook in my eyebrow and I like it" Okay, say, I just got bad news, well, all I'm doing there is trying to share 232 and 13.
And that is how it is done.
Great soap opera that plays all night, class released.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.
Then I have to ask you to keep it.
Who are you?
Hi, I'm Eric, I'll be Chandler's new roommate.
I am Chandler's new roommate.
II do not think so.
I could be Chandler's new roommate.
But he told me on the phone.
He told me personally.
That's funny.
Well, I'm going to my new apartment now. Ehh!

Hello! Look who I found!
Oh, hey people!
You know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought they might be able to help us find out where the presents are hidden.
Yes, when the presents are hidden to the south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your sly jokes - any ideas?
No!
Did not think so!
Okay, come on guys, show us where the presents are!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica brought me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica, that's as good as garbage?
Hmm, how about my Azzz?
Hey, that's hollow.
What?
This bank is hollow! I can not believe that I never knew that! Oh, the presents !!!
No, do not look at her directly!
What?
Okay, no, we could look at her!
I

Hello! I am so glad you are here, but it will take a while. I - I wish you had called first.
Oh, that's alright, I'll come back later with your dad.
Oh good.
I actually had to talk to you before birth.
Okay, what's up?
I've brought something I want to give you, provided, of course, that you want it.
Ma, you ask me if I should marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
Mama no, come on! Many Thanks.
Just listen to me!

Maybe that would have happened if I had had more care, or I had paid more attention, or had a uterus.
I can not believe that!
I know no, no, you know that you do not deserve that, not you Ross.
You are, you are real, you are so good.
Many Thanks.
And you are so cute. And you are nice
Many Thanks.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Huh?
Okay, it's okay.
Oh.
Wait wait.
What?
My foot is in my pocket.
What?
No, I can not understand it.
Rachel?
Yes. Hello Mark!
Hello. I just talked to Joanna and she loves you. You have it, you have the job.
Oh, I did it!
Yes.
Oh dear God!!
Congratulations !! -Lationen.

I can not believe that I did that! What an idiot!
Oh, stop beating yourself!
People make mistakes!
These things happen!
Is not there a message you forgot?
Apparently you are not very good at it!
I
Philadelphia.
Oh dear God! That's how she was! Oh, I have - I have goose bumps.
"Really?"
Well, you know, I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Yes / Yes.
But if - no, okay. These idiots may not interest you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Did you hear that?!
I do not need you to take care of me!
Because the universe cares!
The whole universe!
I really wish they only cared a bit.
You know, I do not think it's you.
This is a funky place.
Hello!
Guys!
Oh no, it's you.
Yes.

I like this. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
They can not all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Oh, there it is.
Oh dear God! These are my bedroom eyes ?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull on this thread?
I have a really good time!
Me too! I'm sorry the guy in the subway licked your neck.
Ohh. No, that's okay, he's a friend.
Hey uh, I do not want to be overbearing, but I have these two tickets to the Ballroom Dance Finale tomorrow night, if you want to go?
Yeah, I know, I - I mean, I missed the semifinals, so I'd just be lost.
I know it's really lame, but I got those tickets from my boss and - Oh no! No! No! My God!
Okay, do not freak out. I will go.
No, it's Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I can not handle her now. This woman is crazy!
OK I know. Please wait. Hey Ross?
Yes?
Yeah, um, this is Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there, do you think now that you can distract her so we can slip?
What?! No!
All right, but I have two tickets for the Ballroom Dance Finale.
Look, I do not think so Pheebs. Good, I will do it. But only because you are a friend.

Well, I-I-I'm done with it. Do you want something Ross? Sports? International? Apartment Listings?
I will do sports.
Mine!
Well. Uh, international.
Okay, look, I - I know what you want to say
You two will have very hairy children.
Okay, I did not know you would say that.
Horse! Janice?
Alright, wait!
Please wait.
Please wait.
That's Ross, okay?
He is our friend.
He obviously went crazy.
He obviously lost his mind.
Look, me
So you will really see her again?
Phoebe! Do not take ideas in his head!
I
Damn Phoebe !!

Hey, we do not have to ...
Yes, we have, um.
Um, I think you're really, really great ...
Oh God!
Here we go again.
Why does this happen to me again and again?
Is it something I'm doing out there?
Is that my fault?
Or am I just crazy?
II do not know, I do not know what to say.
Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.

Waiting!
Terry!
You're welcome!
Look, I just lost my other job.
OK?
You have no idea how much I need it.
Please, help me from old times.
This poor guy has been in a coma for five years. It is hopeless.
It is not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramoray is a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
Good Morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
I'm back, baby! Hahaha!

This kid really kicked me on the plane.
Well, you pulled his hair.
He took my snack!
I can not get in again!
OK! Oh god, do you know what? It is very bad.
Well, I did not tell you to go. Here. There. OK.
That does not mean anything, right?
Of course! Only an idiot would carry this stuff if you did not have the car! Law?
This is true.
Yes, but only a genius would swallow a sonic gun.
Oh, I was there. Yes, I will drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you do not have one.
Come on! What do you do?! I am in character! Would you talk to her?
Ahh, I think it just moved. It really pokes me on.
All right, we're going to the emergency room.
What?! No, you can not, you can not leave me here with them! We sit babysitting!
The babies sleep, I'm sure you're alone for a while!
But you - you can not leave me with them! We - we are a team! We play a zone! You will triple me!
He has some plastic in his throat, we have to go to the hospital.
But no, because a doctor can not help him, it will simply go through his system in seven years.
I think that's gum.
I'm pretty sure it's a weapon.
Okay, listen, that really hurts. Let's go.
A real man would not just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?

Only then could I reach him
Hello! How are the Gellern?
Do not call us that!
The judge did not let us cancel! Now we have to divorce !! Has a porsch surrendered to you?
Hello! It is Porsche !!

Hey sweetie!
Hello!
There is no going back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate stuff like that.
Yes, I know, but I thought, you know.
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry, and then you would not think that I know you, all inwardly dead.
Oh, that's so cute! Look, Chandler, I do not care if you can not cry, I love you.
Oh, that makes me so warm in my hollow tin box.
Stop it!
No, I mean, come on, think about it seriously, we marry, we're at the altar and I'm like that.
I do not care, because I know you'll feel everything in here.
Yes?
Of course he is!
What, do you think, would I just use my son as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
Alright, I'm sorry.
I have to make a wrong Ben.

The basket is completely empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the sweets!
Well, either that or uh
Joey !!
Yes?
Did you eat the sweets of your neighbors ?!
Uh, that was the plan, but when I was there, only a few pieces left!
Yes, and they come all day long. They love it!
You love my sweets? Oh man!!! I have to do more !!
Hey Mon, you might want to do more lasagna because a lot of it could have happened.
Horse! The neighbors ate all my sweets !!
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like one
For sure!
Yeah, since you, uh, told me that story about this bike, I could not stop thinking about it.
I mean, everyone should have a-a
Oh my god Ross !!
You like it?
I
Yes?
Hello darlings.
And there is dad!

There he is! There he is!
From where?
Right - where we searched all night!
He is so cute!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yes, drop it! Let the towel fall! Please leave the - wowww.

I have to tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yes, is not he?
It's so great to meet a guy who's smart and witty and has an emotional age of more than eight years.
Do you know what else? He is amazing in bed.
Impressive. My brother never told me that when he lost his virginity.
Huh. That's nice.

and the miracle was that the bit of oil that should have lasted only one day was burnt
Eight whole days.
That's right, and that's why we're celebrating Hanukkah today. The end.
Brilliant!
Yes?
My favorite part was when
The armadillo was not really like that
Hello!
Oh.
Impressive! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral here.
Come on, come on, we are - we are - we light the candles!
Oh.
Oh.
Okay, I understand why

He says, "Walking with you makes this strange city feel like home."
Yes sure. Good luck!
I finish!! Woo-hoo! I am fine!! I'm fine!!
Impressive! That's exciting, you went to Japan, invented a woman.
What?
I'm just saying, this woman, I mean, she's fictional. No?
Why would you say that?
Because you are still in Monica.
So you told her there was someone else, so she'd agree to work with you, so remember, oh, if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something could happen and ...
You're good. You're good!
Yes, no, I'm pretty intuitive and mentally. It is a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you will not tell her?
Absolutely, oh, I promise. Tell her something?
Many thanks.
No I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive, but my memory is bad.

Excuse me, excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There is no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
No problem. I can not wait for you to meet my friends.
"Really?"
Yes.
Do not you think they are judging and ridiculing me?
No, no, they will. I just ... uh ...
Can not wait.
Do I know you?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How did you feel?
Alright, well, I'm a lawyer now.
You can not be a lawyer. You are eight.
Look, it was nice to see you. I have to walk behind the stage.
Uh, wait, behind the scenes?
Oh yes, my company represents the band.
Horse.
Chandler.
How are you?
Listen, you want to meet the group?
Come on.
Are you one of those who fool around with my dad?

Do you have respect for your body?
Do not you understand what you are - you do it to yourself?
Hey, you know, I've had it with you and your cancer and your emphysema and heart disease.
The bottom line is, smoking is cool and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to talk to you.
"Really?"
He does?
Hey, buddy, what's up!
Oh, she told you about it, hm.
Well, yes, I have one now and then.
Well, yes, now.
Well, it's not that big ... well, that's true ... man, you know, nobody ever said it that way.
Alright, thanks!
God, he is good.
If only he were a woman.
Yes.

Hey, Frank.
Listen, okay, I know that you think I liked this totally evil thing, but I did not.
There's someone who can explain that better than me.
Hello Frank.
Hello, Mrs. Ritter.
Phoebe is right, Frank.
I know it's hard to hear, but it would have been wrong to get away with it.
I-II-I was selfish, even if we, we now want the same things, not in the future.
Is that it, is that what it is?
Yes, but not only that.
Right, not only that. Umm, although we love each other as much as we do, anyway
Yet.
Yet. Um, you're too young to really know what you want.
Exactly exactly.
All right, it's a goodbye kiss, that's good.
Bye.
Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I say, you know, you know, that's clearly wrong.
Okay, I have decided that I will allow that!
Okay, can I just get my purse?
Okay, good, good.
,

Oh, look.
The last candle burns out.
10, 9, 8, 7 ... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48 ....
Many Thanks.
Many Thanks.
Somehow ... scary without light.
Bwah-hah-hah!
OK, people, people? I have the definite. Mwwwoooo-hah-hah ...
Oh oh oh.
Hello Ross. This is probably not the best time to mention it, but you have to throw a party for Monica.

All these things need a lot of space. Hey, um, how serious are you to keep Ben in your life?
You blew her away!
Oh, I can not tell you how great it was to see the crowd and see your face!
I mean ... uh, did you know that you're mumbling the words with me?
I was
No, okay! I felt like a rock star!
Oh dear God! I am yours
I'd better not find you naked in my hotel room!
Look, I've taken it too far!

Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Could have played
Many Thanks.
Okay, Pheebs: Right blue. Well.
Hello? Oh, er, Rachel, it's the one
Oh ok. Will you take my place?
Alright. Yes, that's Rachel.
No no!
Hello?
Oh, yes, no, I know, I - I did not use it often.
Oh, well, thanks, but I'm fine.
Green. To the green.
I have magic beans. Never - no matter.
To the left, to the left - aww!
Ohhh ... I'm fine.

Hello!
Please tell me that you have received the message!
Which message?
The actor who played Mac could not do it, they had to see you at 2 o'clock.
What?! It is 6 o'clock!
You-I-wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
I wrote it on the board, then I went through all of New York City and searched for you!
I went on horseback!
I went to the cafe!
I went to every place where they made sandwiches!
This is the day you will die? See-darnit, I have shuffleboard that day.
That's what you think.
Well, I mean, what about your grandmother's friends? Would not they have the recipe?
Well, do you know that maybe I have relatives in France who would know? My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother Nesele Tolouse.
How was her name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Nestle madhouse
Oh, you Americans always crush the French language.
(grabs a bag
Yes!! Oh.
I can not believe I just spent the last two days figuring out the recipe and it was in my closet all the time!
I know! You see, it's stuff like that, which is why you burn in hell !!

So, we are decided, not on plaid, yes on pink?
Absolute!
I am so on board!
Rachel did not light it?
Yes, I have, but you know what? I'm really trying to look back, you know? Good luck, revenge.
I've actually thought about stopping recently.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I tell myself that I stop, but every Monday morning it is like this
Tell me about it!
Well then let's just stop! We will just stop! Let us all stop!
It sounds appealing.
Oh, I never could.
Oh, but you could.
You can.
Absolute!
We can help each other!
We can - what are these - these patches!
We could be like the patch sisters!
Oh, you know, we really should stop. Okay, let's stop!
Yes! Great! Give me these cigs! Give it! Give it!
My late husband gave me this lighter. I'm not joking.
Alright!

I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Well, maybe it's a contest, you know? How, collect all five?
Do you want to see that?
No no!
Oh, hey, do not do that! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, that's so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a mistake!
Big thing!
How Joey's constant cracking is not annoying?
And Ross, if he skips every single word?
And Monica, with the snort when she laughs?
I mean, what the hell is this thing?
... I accept all these mistakes, why can not you accept me for that?
... Does cracking bother everyone?
Well, I - I could live without it.
Well, is it, how, a bit annoying, or is it like Phoebe chewing her hair?
Oh, now, do not listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's adorable.
Oh, "you do, are you doing"?
You know, there is nothing wrong with speaking right.
"In fact, there is not" ... I should really go back to work.
Yes, otherwise someone could get what they ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out and the gloves come on.

Awww! Mel Torme has died.
Joey, this paper is like a year old!
Oh! Does that mean that?
Hello.
Hello.
Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure?
Well, no. But, I bet she probably does.
Probably?
Yes, I do not like that word.
What "likely" really means.
Yes, um.
Yeah, oh, "Your mother probably will not kill herself, you know?
I'm sorry, but I do not have all the hopes for Rachel and I live together on "Probably!"
You know?
You must take care of yourself!
in the
Bing does not seem so funny right now, right?

Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic wants to greet his future bride.
Oh! Impressive! He takes your breath away, right?
He is a guardian. How do you feel?
Oh, I'm fine.
Can I say, I really admire what you are doing. Raise it all alone.
Oh, I'm not alone. I have Ross.
Oh sure. Now. But what happens when he meets someone and marries?
Well, he's divorced, it's Ross!
I tell you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say that they will be there until they start their true family.
Well, I - That'll never happen to Ross.
Oh, that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm happy when my kid can spend the weekend with her dad and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
OK.
And Tim, I just want to say, good luck here.

Hello. Who is he?
New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
You have your baby!
It is not fair Ross we arrived here first!
Immediately after you left, you brought her to the delivery.
Oh, but not before she gave me a juicy shot of Jamie crowning.
Impressive! We are sorry. So, how are the new people?
Phoebe?
Yes?
Look at the guy at the window, wow!
He's terribly short and I think he talks to himself. And to be honest, he's not so good in bed.
Oh, what's wrong with me lately?
I mean, it's like every guy I see - I mean, look here.
Look at this guy, I mean, usually that's not someone I would - I'd be interested, but right now, with the way I feel, I just want to rip off his sweatpants and his fanny pack.
A moment! That's about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yes.
This is perfectly normal for the fourth month your hormones start to go crazy.
Really?! So this happened to you?
Oh absolutely yes!
Oh, and remember, now I was wearing triplets, so medical terms that I was - I was thrice so horny.
Impressive! That explains so much! Last weekend I went from shop to shop on the lap of Santa Claus.
Yes. Yes, I remember trying to steal a cardboard box from Evander Holyfield

Pooh!
I do not know what I will do!
I called the company that sent, and they do not care!
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if that's not an emergency, then what?
Hi Guys!
Hello!
Hello
I just wanted to thank you again for the last night, what a great party!
And the guys from work had a lot of fun.
You know, one of them has never been to a bachelorette party.
Yes!
And - and no one had ever been to a party
So, hey, that er, that wedding ring, eh? Man, that's nice!
Yes exactly!
I was uh, I thought I could pick one of these babies for myself, maybe I'd like to get one of those
This ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, the ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you could say the ring is irreplaceable.
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations and every bride who wore it had a long and happy life.
So you could say it's a magic ring.
OH DEAR GOD!! I did not really believe it until you said it !!

Well, obviously only one of us can go out with her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well, let's look at it objectively, I think I should go out with it
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
That's interesting, but look at it. I make an appointment with her
Yes, yes, I like that, but only to go in a different direction
Okay, okay. This could take a while.
Yes, we should order some food then.
No Joey! Look, why not, why do not we just let them decide? OK? Hey-hey, we will
That sounds fair.
Maybe I'll take her to the new French restaurant on the street
Ah yes - wait a second now!
Look, we have to set a spending limit on the date.
I do not have the money to bring her to such a fancy place.
I'm sorry, I'm on dates.
Well, I guess I'll just have to do what I do about data.
So let's decide on the spending limit
Yes. Um, a piece of six dollars?
I thought more like a hundred.
OK. Can I borrow $ 94?

Hi, again.
Hello!
Hello!
Many Thanks.
Oh, do not thank me, thank the idiot who never showed up. Okay, I have to get to work.
Do you want help with this?
Oh, no thank you, I got it. No, I do not!
Whoa! Are you alright?
Angry! Stood too fast, got a little head rush.
It's the heat. And - and the humidity.
That's uh, that's a difficult combination.
Do you want some lemonade?
As if you would not believe it. Impressive! This is a great place.
What do you think?
Do you remember how you said that you are really close to poetry? Oh.

Oh!
Hey, someone left his keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Transcriber's Note: Come on!
Who would leave the keys to their Porsche?
If I had a Porsche, I would have operatively attached the keys to my hand!
Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yes, that's what I drive. I make four dollars an hour, I've saved 350 years!
Na-oh! Has anyone lost their keys?
Joey, why do not you put her in the lost and found?
There is a lost and found? My shoe!
You left a shoe here ?!
Well, I only noticed it when I got home.
I would not run all the way down here with a shoe!
You know what?
I'll find that boy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh well, when he gets back to his keys, I'll surely give him your shoe.
Great! Many Thanks.

Ok, and that's Funny Clown. Funny clown is only for after his nap, not before his nap or he will not sleep.
Carol, we've been through this before, ok?
We're having a good time.
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Do not look so surprised. I am a nice person.
Oh, that's so cute.
Oh, I have that for him.
My moms love me. That's smart.
Hello?
Oh, Hi, Ju - Hello, Jew!
Uh huh?
Uh huh?
OK. Um, sure, that would be great.
See you.
Bye.
Did you just say hello, Jew?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did it. That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz. Yes, he likes it. Reaffirms his belief.

Here we go! I do not want my best guest straining their eyes!
Thanks Monica!
Does this smell bother you?
What is the smell of Joey? No, I can barely smell it over here.
Well, let me know if you can, because you know I can bake a cake to cover it.
I can smell it a bit, bake the cake.
OK!
OK.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It is the fire inspector.
Oh! Hello? Yes, that's Phoebe. Really?!
Yes, it turns out that it was not the hair straightener that triggered the fire.
No, no, it was the candles.
It is not good to leave candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in the Fire School is Uhh Uhh Okay.
I have to go now.

Joey suggested it to me.
Is he crazy?! You only had Ross' baby!
Well, I - I said yes.
What?!
Are you crazy?
You only had Ross' baby!
It is so inappropriate.
No, it's worse than that.
It is wrong.
It's ... It's bigger than mine!
I know.
You can not marry him!
Why not? I do not want to do this alone! And he's such a cute guy and he loves me so much.
Do you love him?
For sure.
For sure?
Yes, I mean whatever.
Honey, the question is ... do you really want to marry Joey?
No, I do not. Could you be a sweetheart and tell him?

So, you two are married, right? What happened? You just drift apart?
Here comes the bride.
Oh my god Monica!
I want to wear this every day.
You look so beautiful.
I'm so happy for myself.
Hello?
Hello! Has Chandler already appeared?
Yes, we got it back. All is well.
Damn it!
Uh, you know something?
I'll tell you who it hurts!
It hurts the child whose clothes are stolen in physical education, so he just has to go to the director's office with a catcher's glove!
That was
I will be! Listen, I do not want you to teach my son this stuff anymore. OK?
Fine.
Okay, but I'll let you know that when I taught him the stuff, he called me Fun Fun Rachel.
And I loved being fun, Aunt Rachel, but I'll be boring and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel again, if that's what you want!
No, that's not what I want. Um, I'm glad you connected, but me
Look, he has no brothers or sisters, somebody has to teach him the stuff!
And I did not teach him anything that a normal 6-year-old does not know anyway!
Crap !!
I should go!

Look at this! Look at this! You go to the first-class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
No.
Neither do I! We have to go in!
Act as if you belong.
Oh dear God! Oranges!
Shh! Nice to see you again.
Uh Sir, may I please see your tickets?
Yes, please.
I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can not see the seat number.
Oh, that's alright, I memorized it. It is 1A.
OK. Mrs. Green! Okay, I'm really sorry !! I apologize for the ... Okay, I bit my tongue, but it's me

Hello! Look, who's back! It's the birthday girl! How is the birthday boy?
Well, I'm fine, but I think you're beating the rest of the kids.
What?
OK!
You know what?
I realized that it was stupid to be angry about not having a husband and children.
All I really needed was a plan.
I want to have three children
Oh let me guess, and you want them all at the same time and you want them for your brother.
As I said, I should probably have the first of the three children when I'm 35, which gives me five years.
I love this plan!
I want to marry this plan!
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You are crazy!
Uh, actually I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
Oh oh! So it will be, right? Yes, I can break the rules, you know!
Oh yeah? What will you do?
I dont know.
Why am I not surprised?
Do you know what Ross? I will not let you get away with it!
I do not think you have a lot of choices.
Well, we will see!
Bye!
Goodbye! Hello! So just a light shift?
Yes. Yes. Only here and there.

Father?
I'm there!
Hello!
Hello. God, it seems like yesterday you just came to watch me at work.
Dad, we - we can not believe you're selling the house.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully they'll clear their control before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Let's get our things and disappear.
I am sorry that we can not keep your children's things anymore.
Oh, that's okay, I can not wait to see everything again! All memories
Well, I do not know what's in the boxes, but I know it's six or seven
Before I
Yeah, not as much as you got used to playing uncooked dough eaters.
Hey, it's unreasonable to expect a kid to be waiting for you

Ok, I opened the opening.
Hello, I am Ben. I am a hospital worker Ben. It's Ben ... to the rescue!
Ben, are you ready?
Okay, give me your foot.
Ok, on three, Ben.
One two Three.
Ok, that's it, Ben.
What do you see?
Well, Susan, I see something that looks like a dark vent. Waiting. Yes, it is indeed a dark vent.
Phoebs, it's open! It's open!
Waiting! You forgot your legs!

You have a very impressive CV, Ms. Green. I particularly like what I see here about the introduction of a new filing system.
Many Thanks.
Filing system?
Oh oh!
You mean these little colored labels that you put on all folders?
It has certainly brightened the inside of the filing cabinets.
Well, they are, they - they do more than that.
I realize that you have been trusted with a lot of fairly important responsibilities.
Yes, Joanna really was an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel was really amazing when she got me my morning bag. It's amazing how she almost manages to do it
I-II-I have more responsibility than that, of course.
Oh yes, there is the coffee. Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes that is very good. Well, a big part of this job is maintaining personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that
And Rachel should not have a problem with that. The only problem could be a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
I enjoy working with designers!
With them, among them, what is the difference? Eh, revenge?

Chandler, do you have a wizard right?
Did she call? You - you told her I was sick, right? Always tell her I'm sick!
Chandler, listen, sweetheart, I know you can do that. OK? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yes! Okay, maybe you do not have to smile. Let's try something different. Let's try, try to look sexy.
OK.
Or not.

Where is Chandler?
Here I am.
Wash your hands !!!
How did you know?
Hello! What is she doing here?
Relax, Ross. She is not made of ice!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, have the states laid out geographically ...
What happened in Atlantic City ?!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Did not you hear me saying, "You-building?!"
And this girl is looking at Chandler, okay?
After a while he goes to her and after a minute or two I see them kissing.
Now I know what you're thinking, Chandler is not the kind of guy who just walks in bars and plays with girls, and you're right, Chandler is not the type of guy who just walks in bars and whacks with girls.
You kissed a guy? !! Oh dear God.
It was dark in my defense and he was a very nice guy.
Oh Mon, I laughed so much
Ho-ho, how hard did we have to kick your underwear out again?
Whichever type, you kissed a guy.

So, um, will you stay with me as long as I need you?
Of course I am!
Oh, Mom, I swear, I'm not an idiot.
I've read all sorts of pregnancy and childbirth books, but I - I just did not think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
And - and then guess what?
The baby is coming and I do not know what to do.
Oh, can I surrender to my diaper genius?
No honey, you'll be fine.
Wait - wait where are you going? Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.
OK.
Now do not worry! Everything will be alright.
It
Hello!
Hello! Why are you red and sweaty?
I only have Bamboozled Chandler! What is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.

Okay, the reason why I asked you to brunch today is that I thought about who my maid of honor should be.
Oh dear God! That's it! I really hope it's you!
I hope you are.
Me too!
First of all um, I love you both so much and you both are so important to me
Okay, blah-blah-blah-blah !! Who is it?!
Well, I thought we might be able to develop a system where we deliver each other out as a maid of honor.
How hypothetical, if Phoebe belonged to me
Yes!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
Still.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor
Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachel, so we all would do it once and nobody would get upset.
Yes, that's a pretty good idea.
Yes I'll do it. So who will be yours?
Well, that's the best part. Um,
Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I do not have to!
Well, from
I really do not decide!
Fine!
Yes that's right.
Aww, and good luck to you! What a nice lady!

If you want to make a Christmas present to Joey that upsets the whole building, why not give him something more subtle, like a wrecking ball or a vial of smallpox released in the hallway?
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air and I have to say, "Oh my eye!
Oh God, my eye! "
I mean, it's so annoying.
Yes thank you. You see, normal people should react to drums.
Phoebe, you have Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she would not want to live there anymore?
Maybe on a certain level.

Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, I'll pick you up for our date. These are for you.
Oh, lilies. Joey, they are my favorites. Many Thanks.
And, a brownie!
Well, half a brownie.
Actually, it's just a bag.
It was a long walk from the flower shop and I felt so weak
Oh man!
This is so great!
I actually feel like I'm on a real date!
Although, I have a touch of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes until then.
Hey, come on, this is a real date.
Uh, so nice that you are here.
Foosball, right?
Pizza box.
Oh, a subscription to
Yes, that's my roommate.
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a standing guy.
Oh yes, but he is very protective of me, so you better take care of yourself.
Ah, so, is this roommate good?
Hm-mmm.
Oh yes, it must be hard to keep your hands off him, eh?
Yes, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
No no no no! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!

Can you believe what an idiot Ross was?
Yes I know. He can become really competitive.
Ha. Haha.
What?
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
You're welcome! I'm not as bad as Ross.
Oh, I want to be different. The
That was
Oooooh. : Oh! I have an interview! I have an interview!
Well, do not play raquetball!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
He did not get the glasses!
Well, sounds like you have two problems.
Bye Baby.
Ciao, Bela.
Are you waiting for me to do that?
So you will tell him?
Why should I tell him?
How about, if you do not, his mother could.
Oh...
What are you doing here?
Uhhhh .... he does not even wear a jockstrap!
... what did I ask?

God. I feel hurt.
Did anyone still feel that she just wanted to peel the skin off her body to do something different?
Ross, ten o'clock.
Is it? Feels like two.
No,
What?
At eight, nine, ten o'clock is a beautiful woman!
Oh. Hello!
She's gorgeous! It makes the women I dream of look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go over to her! She is not with anyone.
Oh, and what would my first line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh. "
Oh come on. She is a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she?
He could never get such a woman in a million years.
Thanks buddy.
Oh, oh, but you know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
You could do that!
Y'think?
OK, that's enough of the view. Look at that, look at that. Sit down, sit down.
OK.
That's great! Helen, could you come in for a moment?
Thanks Helen, that will be everything.
The last time I do that, I promise.

I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh-huh.
And I will cook everything you want here and do everything!
Yes you will! And, are you kidding me ?!
Come Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Sorry? Please, please, please?
OK.
OK.
So, are we going in there?
I am!!

Impressive!
It is actually in the manual.
I can not go out with you or have a hot plate in my office.
I can not believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I've appreciated that you got up for me. It felt really good. It somehow made me even more like you.
I know, I know that I really like you too. But we - we can not date. It's against the rules. It is forbidden.
Impressive!
What?
Just to hear that you have described it as forbidden, it is really hot.
"Really?"
Yes.
Well, I - I - I do not care how hot it is - it's uh, it's wrong.
Stop it!
No! No! It is wrong! It is - it is naughty. It is taboo.
Close the book!
Let's get a hot plate too!

Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you have a great job! Good friends
Yes! So, when are you going to marry?
Oh, I do not do it, I'm just trying that.
I do the same.
I was only joking. I am marrying the 25th of July
I'm just having fun. I will marry in December.
When will you get married?
Oh May 15th
Oooh, it is getting closer!
Yes!
So, who is your photographer?
Jeffery.
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the wedding he did?
The best man? Impressive!
I know! I almost canceled my wedding. Oh, who is your band ?!
Oh, my fiance wants the swing kings.
Oh, you are so lucky. My fiance wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Ooh, is that spelled out with a "C" or a "K"? Oh dear God! It does not matter; They are both great!
Oh you know something?
You know what?
Now that you know what you want, you should go to Kleinman and halve it.
This place is so overpriced.
So, is that in a different color right?

I tell you, over the next few years, schoolchildren will consider it as one of the biggest first dates ever.
It was amazing!
We could be totally ourselves, we did not have to play games ...
Did you call her already?
Let her know that I like her?
What are you, crazy?
It's the next day!
How needy do I want to appear?
I'm right, right?
Oh yeah. Yes. Let her dangle.
I can not believe that my parents are putting pressure on me to find one of you people.
Oh god, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosterone!
Which is the real San Francisco, by the way. I have your machine.
Your answering machine?
No, interestingly enough, she picked up leaf blowers.
So, uh, why did not you say anything?
Oh, no, no, no. The last time I left a spontaneous message, I used the phrase "Yes, indeed - o."
Look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, do not look all at once!
Okay, okay, what's up?
Okay, they just talk ...
Yes, well, does he look upset? Does he look as if he has just been told to push something?

So, um, what are you doing professionally?
Well, um, in recent years I've been working ... which is weird, because that was not even my main subject.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
I thought they could ... I'll try to come back as soon as possible. I'm so sorry.
This is funny.
Hey, do you think ... would it be weird if I invited Carol to join us?
Because she is now alone and pregnant and sad.
I guess.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Do you want to come over and join us?
Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on.
These people will come down.
You guys will skate, right?
Let's try to scoop!
Come on.
Come on.
Um, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches the sixth grade.
And, Kristin, Kristin ...... does something that strangely was not even her main subject!

OK.
Well.
When I was six years old.
Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big bike.
And instead, my parents got me this little plastic chicken on which you jump around.
It was embarrasing; Kids made fun of me.
That was a pretty tough year.
That's great!
See?
I have the feeling that I know you a little better!
Many Thanks.
Okay, come on.
Now we can go out to eat.
Let's go.
It was terrible. They called me chicken boys.
Oh!

Will you choose one, choose one! Here, how about this?
These are garden furniture!
So, as people come and think, "Oh, oh, I'm out again?" Of course!
What about the birds?
I do not know, birds just do not say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
You choose one.
Alright, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so forget the birds, but big red insects recommend good food!
Good, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I will not! Kip would have liked the birds!

Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?
Bijan for ... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe you could take a cup of coffee after work.
Oh, actually I have plans.
Ready, Annabelle?
You bet. Maybe another time?
Hey, it's not the first time that I've defeated a girl from a cowboy who injects Cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!

That was amazing!
Phoebe and Gary are
That was amazing.
We are the hottest! Huh?
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
No, you are the best.
I
Hi Guys! What did he do?
Hey Joey! Is not that the girl who wished you the other day?
How are you'?

So what will you do?
What can I do? A person wants to dissolve, you break.
Hey, no way! Come on, that's you, call her and explain.
Oh, come on, we just had this big fight, alright, do not I have to wait a while?
Hey, that's not like swimming after eating, pick up the phone !!
You know that all swimming is a myth.
Yes, tell my uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, he really believes that.

It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt very fat this morning.
Well, okay, so what's up now - get the eggs, put them in.
Okay, it will only take a little while to prepare the embryos.
Embryosss? As in "More than one?"
Um-hmm, actually five.
Five? Okay, where do I give birth to a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We're doing five, because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
That's it! 25 percent? That means there's 75 percent chance of not having a baby!
Hey, you know, I've been thinking, what are the chances, if - if you have 200 of them in there?
Sweety, now she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Okay, you know, do not worry, because I - I'll do it as many times as needed to get it right.
Well, you see, that - the thing is, we - we only have, we have a shot to get it right.
Umm, it costs $ 16,000 every time you do that.
So, um, we somehow use all the money we have, just this once.
Wow !! That - okay, that's one
No, I'm sorry.
Impressive! You really do not know anything!
I know! Why do not you get drunk? It worked for many girls in my high school.

We are sorry. How is Joey?
Oh just great.
He beeps me with codes now.
One is: "Bring me food."
Two is: "I'm with a girl, bring us food."
Three is: "I am lost and I can not find food."
Hello! Is uh, is she alright?
Yes! It's right in there!
Oh cool. Hello! Take off your pants, they look finished!

Hello!
Hello!
You have something to eat? I just went to Johnos for a chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry to dinner, but everything was hurt. So we turned it off!
Pheebs, if this guy always closes all our favorite places, where will we eat ?!
I do not know, clean places?
Umm, yummy!
It's Danny.
Do not let him in! I should be at a regattagala.
We're almost there! Can not you just say that it starts later?
What? What kind of Regattagala starts at night ?!
The wrong kind!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. Do you have a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party.
OK great!
Hey, guys, do you know what Larry would say? He would say, "We'll see you."

You are so efficient. I love you!
Let's go!
No no no! We need something old!
Oh, great, I have condoms in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
That will work!
I do not think so.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Here you take that easy.
That's theft!
No, we will bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Ohh.
Okay, one thing at a time.

I'm sorry. So. What did you do?
Oh, not much. I got a job.
Oh that's great.
Why are you so tanned?
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
Nope! I lie. I am so drunk.
Oh god, oh.
Great, Monica, you know what, you could have called, I was up here, I was worried ...
Monica? Monica!
Water rules!
Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they want to know if you're going to work?
Nope. Go
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You will lose your job! That is not you!
No, it's me!
You know, I'm not just the person who has to freak out the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that.
I am Monana!
Hello? Yes, she is, please, wait a second. Monana, this is for you, the credit card people.
Helloooo? Yes. Oh dear God. Many Thanks.
What?
They arrested Monica.

Note the quaint lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and normally outside, as his elusive subject was itself light.
Do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain thinks monster trucks!
Ok, remember, when you come to the museum, Monet is not spelled as M-O-N-A-Y.
I have just...
I wrote that phonetically for you.
Phonetically?
Yes, that means ... you know? We just have ... we do not have time for that.
OK.
Ok, but you know something? I have to say, I am really impressed that you can remember all this so fast!
Ah! I am an actor! I can learn everything by heart! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal-zygomatic craniotomy".
Impressive. What does it matter?
No idea!
But the guy I said it dies in the next scene, so I think it means "you'll be eaten by a bear".
OK! Are we coming to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses Chiaroscuro here to highlight the fear of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! ,
No, ah! No, ah! No no no! No ad libbing and dude, you can not
Come on! You...
No!

Oh. Oh oh.
Hello! What happened to you? Why did not you come up?
Done!
You're done right now?
Well, I wanted to be thorough.
I mean that - that is clearly very, very important for you, for us!
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
So, um, right?
I'm so sorry.
Makes it?
Makes it? Makes it? Yes, I wanted to give it all, right? Part just another look.
What are you talking about, Ross, you said you read it twice!
Look, you know what, either it does or does not, and if you have to do it
No, revenge, no. Not me, not me, not me
Are you sure?
Oh sure! I'm sure.
I know.

You got married again.
Yes.
This is your second marriage in two years.
Yes, the second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, I've been a divorce lawyer for 23 years and never had so much business from a client.
Why do not you tell me what happened?
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel you called in the second marriage at the altar?
Yes Yes Yes! But I - I do it
Oh, that's better then.
That was just a drunken mistake and I have to cancel it.
Aha. Did you consider a therapy?
I only think so
There are a few forms to fill out.
Easy.
And we have to have witnesses who can testify that you are not of uh, sanity.
No problem.
And we need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Oh!
There is no way to do this without them?
Because I was somehow ready to tell her it was done.
No!
OK.

So, Phoebs owes $ 7.50, Monica, you owe $ 10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
But thanks for teaching us Cross Eyed Mary. You guys, we have to play this in our normal game.
Alright, here are my $ 7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Oh, I cursed it. So bad things will happen to whoever spends it.
That's alright, I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.
That way I can break it with a movie.
Well, that leaves only the big green poker machine that owes fifteen ...
Ah! Huh?

Do you want to do it now?
Great!
Ok, I just want to be sure this time. Andie McDowell is the girl out
No no no no no no. This is Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the type of
Oh yeah. OK thanks.
You're welcome.

is for me to no longer see you.
That's crazy!
You can not do that!
What will you tell her?
Oh God.
Oh, you agreed, did not you?
It's awful, I know, I mean, I feel terrible, but I have to do that if I want my marriage to work.
And I have to, I have to do it
Ohh! I'm lucky! Oh dear God! The
You have no idea what a nightmare that was. That's so difficult.
Oh, really? Is it Ross? Yes? Okay, let me make this a little easier for you.
What do you do?
Breaking out!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yes, well, that's how crazy I am !!

These little women. Impressive!
You like it, right?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I do not see how he could ever forgive her.
Umm, Jo is a girl, it's an abbreviation for Josephine.
Chandler.
Hello.
Hello.
Joey.
Hey-hey!
Hello.
This is Monica.
Whoa!
And that's Rachel.
Hello!
Wow !!
I will get coffee.
Hey, how are you doing something?
We do not, really.
Well, well, do you have many big plans now?
Oh yeah! Yes, no, we will connect, you know, and everything.
Yeah, I thought maybe we could go to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a whore.
You know, we do not really exploit life in the city.
I know.

Okay, Chandler!
OK.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth, someone will give you something."
Oh, thank you.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spit.
Oh, wait, and on the nineteenth a secret swarm reports.
Hi Guys!
Hello!!
Oh dear God! It is Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!!!!!!
Oh, that's right. It's your first day! Are you ready to tackle fake crimes with your robot sidekick?
Am I crazy? The main role in my own TV series? I've dreamed of that for years! Why did not I prepare myself ?!
No! Joey, you will be great!
But I had to deal with a robot Pheebs and - and I know nothing about technology!
I can not even use Chandler's computer except to find porn!
And - and that's just because it's right there when you turn it on!
I think our lover's spit will do something at the beginning of the month.
I'll wait.

Well, that's last minute, so I apologize for the mess. OK?
Oh dear God! It certainly did not look like I lived here.
I know!
Look, there is only one problem.
There's only room for one, so one of you has to stay with Joey.
Well, since the fire was somehow my fault, I think you should stay here.
Hello! Hey-hey, nobody was guilty of Pheebs. OK? It was an accident.
Well, no, it was my fault, so you should get the nice room.
OK!
So revenge!
You are the first guest at Hotel Monica!
Um, you just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.
And I thought I would bring her to you, you know, in bed.
Oh, you've been through so much.
I have.

That's just Bactine. You will not feel any pain.
Sorry, that was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Why do not we just put the "poor Tooty" in the hall?
During a power failure? He would be trampled!
Yes?

Ben, I want you to know that there may be times when I can not be around.
But I will still come back like that.
And sometimes I may be gone longer, like that.
But I will still come back like that.
And sometimes I want you to be a third party, and I will continue like this.
He is so amazing.
Oh, I know. Look at him.
Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I do not think that's his name.
Oh, look, look, he closes his eyes. Look, he opens his eyes.
He does not do much, right?
No, that's pretty much everything.
Do you want to drink coffee?
Yes.
Okay, see you later.
Oh, look, he closes his eyes again.
Come on, they will love you.

May I help you.
Oh dear God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I am from the forest! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
Oh, it's like a big weight has been lifted!
Look, no hair loss, no rash, no hives, I'm just so happy!
Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria - Oh.

Well, thanks for lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I did not pay, I thought you pay!
So we apparently do not pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
How did it go?
Had the money in the wrong hand.

Okay, I'll steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants to take responsibility for ensuring that nothing happens?
I will do it.
Who wants it? Someone?
I said, I will do it!
Nobody wants to do it? Good, I'll do it myself.
Monica! I will not mess it up!
You know what?
You're right, I'm sorry.
Actually, you were a great help tonight.
Yes, and thank you for putting my grandmother in the taxi and making sure she came safely to the hotel.
Well, of course I'm here for that!
OK. We are sorry.
Pooh! What grandmother?

Hello. Day, I have a conference call today, is that correct?
Yes, at 4:00.
Okay thanks.
That's all.
Waiting!
Waiting!
Did you see that?
This postman had no idea that something was going on between us.
You saw my huge pile of porn, right?

Hey Monica, it's chip.
Yes!!
Who is Chip?
Shhh!
Good thing you're running into the bank in the bank today, so here's my number 555-9323. Call me. Later.
Chip, is Chip Matthews.
The guy who brought Rachel to Prom? Why is he calling you?
Because I met him in the bank, he is still so cute.
Monica, you are so lucky! He is like the most popular guy in school !!
I know!! Chip? Hello! It is Monica. "Kay. "Kay. OK. Goodbye. Oh my god we just had
I just wanted to leave.
Well! Because I have a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I do not fall asleep.
Why? Did you write it?
Impressive! Look at this, called Chip Matthews. I wonder what he wants?
Well, actually ...

Here is your tea Phoebe.
It is so good. Oh thank you.
Well.
I'm so glad you liked it.
Oh!
What?!
What?! She made the tea!
Oh! No, I - I think I just had a contraction.
You what?
Oh dear God!
I like her. She looks smart.

I have no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry that I had to work tonight.
Oh, it's ok. You were worth the wait, and I do not mean just tonight.
I actually have
: Yes, well, your friends are against it.
I've been a nice guy so far, but I do not need that grief.
I call the landlord and tell him that Monica illegally rents the apartment of the grandmother here.
Your friends are here, buddy.
Why do not you tell me something I do not know!

Well! I found one that fits!
Now you know what they say, the 23
Who owns this?
Oh, is it important ?! All that matters is that you look so good.
Oh damn!
No! Do not say that! Do not say that!
Damn it!
No, not! Go back to repeat!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!

Hello revenge! Hey, do you mind if I read my comics here?
For sure! Why?
Well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's hard to concentrate.
What?!
She just called and said that she would work late!
She keeps lying to me!
That's it!
You know what?
I just go and confront them immediately!
Well, Chandler, I-I'd love to drop by tonight.
"Really?"
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, at seven?
Yes.
Well. I am looking forward to you and me during intercourse.
Hey-hey, look at it! Listen! Ugly naked guy has a naked boyfriend!
Oh yeah! Oh dear God! This is
Yes, it is! Naked steed !!

You know, hey! You're the one who finished it, remember?
Yes, because it was me
You still love me?
No.
What does that mean? What do you want, I want, come back together?
No! Could be! I, I do not know.
What?!
I only feel, me, me - I only ...

I have won! I have won! I have won!
I have won! That was my neighborhood!
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
Excuse me please! This lady played my neighborhood, that's my money.
Is that true, miss?
Sells drugs to children.
What?!
She sells drugs to children.
It was my neighborhood!
Was it her neighborhood?
How about we talk about it at dinner?
Okay, lady, you're out of here.
No! No, you can not arrest me! No!! I will not go back! I will not go back to this hellhole !!
I'll just get you out!
Oh ok.

Hello!
Hello!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that could make you stay married. We register, and
No!
Ross, come on!
No!
Listen, look, I've been thinking a lot about how to tell you that, and the bottom line, Ross, we can not stay married.
I do not know if it's true.
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, okay, do you know what that is?
Oh Ross, come on! That's not, that's not a marriage !! This is the worst hangover in the world! Ross, listen, if
Well. Good, I will do it.
Many Thanks. Hey-hey um, is there any such thing as a cancellation shower?

Hello! What are you doing right now?
Hello.
Make sweets for the neighbors.
Yes!
So can I really never win anymore?
How much has anyone ever won before?

He is so cute. So, where did you grow up?
Brooklyn Heights.
Cleveland.
How, how did that happen?
Oh dear God.
What?
I suddenly had the feeling that I fell. But I am not.

Many Thanks.
That was very nice Ashley.
No no.
So, am I off now?
I'm the next one!
Oh!
Obviously they do.
What?!

Ok, I'll take a break, I'll go out the window.
No, no, no, not! I've been waiting to go out with Lorraine forever. Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You asked me for the woman I kicked out twice in the last five months!
Can you stop screaming? You make me nervous, and I can not go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on !!!

Hey guys, guess what?
The British are coming?
Ohh, you and your ways. There is Christmas time. I will be one of those fundraisers.
Yes, I already have my bell and later ... I'll get my bucket.
Ohh.
Yes, yes, I will be out there spreading joy to the people.
I mean, last year I spread a little joy, but not really enough.
So I'm going to do the whole city this year.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. she was
I can not
Oh! Look at that, the time is up! It's my turn!
That was half an hour?
It's your timer.
You know, I do not want to use it, but I give it
Good, then massage me really nice!
Ah! Ahh !! Ahh !!
It's so good, right?
It's so good, I do not know what I did to earn it!
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Goodbye muscles !!

Oh who-who-whoa!
Wait a minute, open your hand. Let me see.
Quarter.
Dime.
Lint?
Not interested.
What's this?
A Canadian coin?
Get out!
Whoa-who-whoa!
No drinks near the bucket!
Put them there and then you can contribute!
And you can see the injured rabbit over there!
Hello Bob!
I thought I told you to come out here!
Uh, Phoebe, we got complaints and uh, we'll take you to a lesser known place.
Well, because we thought you knew it !! It is so obvious! God, that would be Monica to say, "Hey, you like things clean."

Hello Joe! Want to shoot some hoops?
Oh no, I can not go. I practice; I got an audition as moderator of a new game show.
Oh cool!
That's great.
Yes, yes, and if I get it during the day, I will Drake Remoray, but by night I will be Joey Trrrribbiani!
You will be perfect for it! That's your name!
But the audition is in a few hours and I do not even understand the game.
Do you want help?
Really? That would be great! You can be the candidates!
Brilliant!
Okay, I guess we can lose to Junior High Girls a few times.
Well! Let's play Bamboozled!
Bamboozled?
Yeah, is not that a cool name?
Yes!
No!
Oh. Okay, just breathe.
Oh darling, I think I have one too!
Look at that! Here we go!

Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the paleontology department, fifth floor, stack 437?
Oh well! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to a responsible person, please ?!
How can I help you?
Hi, I wonder if it is possible to increase the security in paleontology?
See, I-I've written a book up there, and instead of reading it, the people who are there are good and rolling around in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
But as far as security is concerned, the library is unfortunately very understaffed.
I can not help you.
All right then.
Fine!
If - if I am the only person who appreciates the sanctity of the written Word, I will go up and defend it myself!
And you do not follow me?

OK. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant or in his shower drain?
Oh dear God! Phoebe, it's Ross and this girl.
No! No! Look at this! It is a line of ants! You work as a team!
Phoebe!
Right, oh yes.
Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is going to break up with her.
Uff, I hope he drops her easily.
Let's go.
Come on, Phoebe, look at this!
They do not break apart, look at them.
Okay, do you know what that is?
That's one, that's a second date, that's it!
Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh ...
Oh no! That's really nothing, she is
Ohh! Phoebe, that's all your fault! Now he loves her, he'll marry her, and that's all your fault.
You know where I work!
I do?
The cinema, you were there all the time.
Are you still working in the multiplex?
Oh, like I'm giving up this job! Free popcorn and sweets whenever I want. I can bring you free posters for your room.
Thanks, I'm done. Are you still living with your parents?
Oh yes, but I can stay as long as I want.

Nice car!
Yes, it does not belong to me.
I love your car.
Yes, it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Me too! Yes. And comfortable. Are you doing leather seats?
Yes!
It has it!

Joey, please!
We are sorry.
ahhhhhhhhhh
Hello children!
Hello! Do you want to play table football? Sorry?
OK.
No no no! We have to bring the table to my room, yeah! Because of all the boxes. Come on!
Alright, I have a question.
Bye little doll Joey hand?
No, the quiet thing!
You mean that.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-don't know how much of it I can take! Did you know that he pasted my?
Alright, you know, that might be tough, but come on, that's Ross! I survived college with him!
Okay, I guess I can last a little longer. Let's have a game.
OK.
No no no no!
YES!!
Uh, guys,
Okay, so he's gone here.
Okay, you know what, because you said that, I will not go out tonight.

I know it does not make much sense
A lot of
See Chandler, it was instinct! OK? I just did it!
So you risk your life for a sandwich!
I know, it sounds crazy, but Chandler, that's the best sandwich in the world!
So you did not choose Ross in front of me.
No! I would never do that! You - you are like my brother!
Really?!
Yes! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Many Thanks.
No, oh, oh-oi, just, it's not a hot dog!
How good is that?
Oh-oi-ho, yes!
See?
Uh-huh.
Oh-who-hey, dude, what are you doing ?!
I thought, you show me how much you mean to me.
Yes. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!

Look at the ring.
Kind! One and a half car easy.
Hello.
Hey-hey Pheebs!
What?
Chandler will ask Monica to marry him!
Oh, I know, I helped pick the ring.
You told her before you told us?
Well, she came in as I looked at the ringlets. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?

Just take a look.
The Congress is debating a new deficit reduction ... the mayor wants to increase the subway tariffs again ... the high was forty-five today ... and - oh, teams were playing sports.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
No ... not - not special enough.
Oh! How about Agamemnon?
Waaay too special.

Hey Pheebs!
Hello!
Listen. How much of a man am I ?!
Impressive! Kind! Male and also a kind of slut.
You know, I'm starting to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh-huh.
Silk? Feels really good!
Ah yes, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Come on, come in.
Thank you for allowing me to stay here! I mean, Monica was nice, but her fiancé is staring a lot.
Oh.
Oh dear God! You make a great Chandler!
Uh-huh. Yes, I - I have a knack for impressions.
Well, maybe, after we get to know each other again, you can do it.
Yeah no !!

Hello! You! Look at it, look at it! Guess what job I got.
I do not know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
What?
Blue Blazer back. He - he wants it back.
But you - you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Well, you - you know what I meant.
No, you messed up You are stupid.
So, what job do you have Joe?
Oh, ah, tour guide in the museum. Yes, Ross has it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, do not you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
I just went to the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
You know, if we ever go to war and you're trapped, it's your turn
It is getting worse and worse!
You know?
I mean, it's bad enough that I fell in love with my roommate - which, by the way, I know she knows.
Because every time we are together in the room, this strange energy is between us.
And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
And now I have seen her naked.
I mean, at least, if I've seen her with dressed clothes, I imagine her body is covered in trees or something.
But there are no logs, it is smooth!
Smooth!
Impressive! Could everyone totally see his robe?
Yes! Oh dear God!

So, you and Angela, what?
Yes. Pretty much.
Oh, that's what she meant!
You know, if they shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!
You know, short for museum, and avoid the confusion!
Yes, most of it is a place
Okay, sure, so I'll take her to the MET.
Yeah, um, ok, there's this great, rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.
You know what?
She loves architecture, do you know what you should do?
You should take a walk down to St. Patrick's Cathedral and there is this great little cake shop that she would love.
Gosh, sounds like you're going to this date!
But I am not! , You know what if you feel like Thai food ...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slowly, you go
OK.
You have to tell me exactly what to do there.
Okay, if you go to the museum, go right, that's the antiques wing.
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, until the Byzantine Empire.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So I go through the door and make the right

Hello!
Hey, is everything okay with the cancellation?
Oh yes, no problems. Everything is done.
Ross, thanks. Hey, do you want to watch a movie?
Oh yes, why not?
Pheebs?
No thanks, I have already seen one.
Okay, um, I'll get my sweater.
OK. You, you want to hear something strange?
Always.
I did not get the cancellation.
What?!
We are still married! Do not tell Rachel. See you later.

Hello! Are you alright?
Fabulous.
Listen, playwrights, they're nothing but people who can not do it as actors. Do you know what you should do?
Exactly. So you did not say anything to Issac, did you?
Oh, well, I'll tell Issac everything.
You say so, of course. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hello! You know, we did not really meet ...
You dog!
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, you see, I happen to have a girlfriend.
Oh right, that Rachel Chick from the coffee.
Yes, that's one. Listen, I do not want to hurt her.
Oh, hey, man, I know, no matter how much we love her, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Yes. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Aw, no problem, dude. You know, we have to take care of each other. We are the same, you and me.
No, we are not.
Yes, we are.
No, we are not.
Yes, we are.
No, we are not!!
Okay, we are not.
Law.
But we are.
Fine. All I have to do is know that you will not tell your sister.
I can promise not to tell her again.

Emily!
Oh dear God! What are you doing here?
I just had to see you again before you left.
You're so sweet.
That's, that's a big candy bar. (She holds one of those huge ones
Me too.
Well, that's me. Here, have that. I may anyway only have a piece of carryon.
Wait, listen.
II have to tell you something.
Um, I thought, I'll just come out and say it.
OK?
I-II-I-ah, I-I think I love you.
Oh. Many Thanks.
This is not a problem.

Monica!
She sleeps.
I know, just quick question, quick question. Which one was
Deep Impact
Sorry, I just can not sleep.
Oh!
Where is the book you read with the two women skating and wearing the hats with the flowers on them?
Because every time I look at this cover, I'm like
It is in the living room, where there is also a light! And nobody will kick you in the shin.
Hey Ross! So, I have just visited the er, real estate area
Yes?
Look at that.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house.
Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb in the front and that uh, the window in the attic is oh my god!
!
What? What happened to the window in the attic ?!
I can not believe that mom and dad sell the house!
I can not believe it - they did not even tell us!
I can not believe that I still do not know what happened to that
Uh, hello father! Monica and I have just seen the house in the newspaper! Yes, we are surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
We are sorry!

Okay, so
Nothing?
Look, you and I got a present.
OK?
We have to do something with it.
Like-like, hand modeling!
Huh?
Or - or magic!
And you
I have to come back
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Wow, wow!
We could have our own show!
You know, we could clap our hands together, people will love it!
Huh?
And - and - and I wrote a song for ourselves!
(Singing, to the melody of
That's okay.
But you have not heard the choir yet!

Well, she will understand, right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Daddy, she does not care.
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all she's got is growing new stuff!
See, that's just the kind of thing that makes her think you love me more than you love her.
Oh my god, does she really think so?
Well, can you blame her?
Well, I do not know, I - I suppose we may have unconsciously favored you, you were a medical miracle! The doctor said your mother could
Dad, Dad, I do not want to hear about it.
"Really?"
Well, not right now.
Okay, Monica came here for some memories and damn, we'll give her something!
Okay, grab some empty boxes.
OK?
We will - take stuff from me and whatever we can pass on as hers - we will bring them in there.
Great!
You know, Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could?
Yes! I sail all my life. When I was fifteen, my dad bought my own boat.
Your own boat?
What?! What?! He tried to cheer me up! My pony was ill.

He comes here for Thanksgiving!
Count in our heads so well
I guess I'm done.
Fun is over!
Wait, wait, people! If - if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Uh-huh!
I think I'll get away.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help to control the fun! Oh!

Dehydrated Japanese noodles under neon light ... does it
Question. You do not go out with anyone, or you, because I met someone who would be perfect for you.
Ah, yes, perfect, could be a problem. Did you say "dependent" or "self-destructive" ...
Want a date Saturday?
Yes, please.
OK. He is cute, he is funny, he is-
He is a he?
Good yes!
...Oh God.
I just- I thought- Fine, Shelley.
I'll just rinse off the toilet now ...
Okay goodbye ...

Well, it's official that there are no good movies.
Let's go to a bad and make out.
Maybe you want me to turn so you can bump Bunny against my back.
Hello!
Hello.
Hey man. How are you?
Maybe you can tell me.
My agent would like to know why I did not show up at the audition that I did not know I had today.
The first good thing she gets me in weeks.
How could you not give me the message?
!
Well, I'll tell you that I feel guilty, but, ah, it was not me.
Yes, it was! He was it! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
Look at Joe, so your parents told you not to jump on the bed.

May I ask you something? Have you ever had a crush on a guy?
So you wanted to tie my tie?
There's this kid in my class who says he's in love with me.
Whoa!
Whoa what?
Ross has a friend.
I'll do it
"Really?"
Yes!
I dont know.
I mean, last year Elizabeth now - now this kid.
What-what-what-what is it?
Do I give any kind of sexy professor vibe?
Not now.
It-it-the point is that my natural charisma has made him fail his interim exam.
Oh, look now, I feel bad for the kid!
I once had a crush on a teacher and it was so hard!
You know, I could not concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
I mean, come on, you remember what it's like to be 19 and be in love.
Oh yeah! Many Thanks! Oh, that's how the French drink it.

A new pair of shoes for the Chan-chan man! Yes!
Yes! I have - I have never seen such a role in my life!
That's right, baby! Okay, what do I want now?
Okay, um, ah, an 8. Ah, a 6?
Choose a number! That is yours
8. 8!
Many Thanks!
If you get this one, we all buy a steak dinner here!
Yes I understand.
Take as much time as you want.
Ten, even twenty minutes, when you need it.
I'll be there.
Do not smoke.

We will really do that, right?
Looks like it.
You know, if that's too weird for you, we can still go out there
I understand it!
OK.
Susan! Hello!
Hello!
Thank you for coming.
Oh, I would not miss it for the world.
By the way, I'm Ross.
Hello Ross. I love what you did with this room.
Thank you very much.
How hot is that ?!

Guess who is here. It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben. "A real American hero, I am
G.I. Joe
Look, Ben, it's a toy that protects US oil interests overseas!
It took me 28 years to find a man to spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years, then I'm 56 before I can have a baby and that's just stupid.
That's stupid.
I do not need a real man, just a few of his best swimmers.
And there are places you can go to fetch the stuff.
Back down in the docks?

Hello. How many, how many have you sold?
I will not tell you! You're the bad guy who broke Sarah's leg.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
You are a big scrud.
What is a Scrud?
Why do not you look in the mirror, Scrud?
I do not have, too. I can only watch you.
Alright, girl and man. Let's see your last results. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of biscuits, very nice.
Not nice enough.
Charla, 278. I'm sorry, darling, but still good.
So how did the lasagna go?
Really?!
Well.
You owe me three beautiful things.
Yes, I have thought a lot about you.
I know.
It's hard this whole platonic thing.
It is a word!
Yes, I think it's better that way. Yes, we are smart. Yes I am sure.
Are you really sure?
I'll call you back.

So, will you really go out with this nurse?
Well, you and I just mess around, I thought, why not fool around with him.
You know, I do not know if you've ever looked up the term in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together.
But if you have that new twisted dictionary that's aimed at me, you know, you have to get my original dictionary.
I am
I think you are better than you think.
"Really?" Okay, so
Do you know when to stop?
You know, I felt that I should stop. So are we okay?
Yes. Okay, I'll tell Dan that it will not happen. Do not do the dance.
Law!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Do you know, ow!
Hey! - Hey! What's happening?
She broke my arm.
He touched my fanny.
No, she touched mine first!
That's my job!
Are you British?!
No not more.
Why are you going shopping here? You do not live in this neighborhood. Did you wait here for me?
Yes, hm. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up a few things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party does barley serve?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends are not as demanding as yours.
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Who is party?
A woman
Which woman ?!
Chelsea.
Okay, you know, one of two things happens here.
Either you see someone behind my back, which would make you the biggest idiot on the planet.
Or you pretend to see someone who makes you so pathetic that I could start crying here in the Grain Course.
So which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be the guy?

Great story again! The yarns you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
You know, I-I-really should go.
Oh no, no! Stay! Stay! Because you - you should - you - you should stay!
Impressive. Oh, I'm really flattered, but I just do not feel that way.
Oh no - no, that's not - no - no!
Did you just strip me?
OK, well, you would not let me finish and I was Jus ... [Monica hits her back] Au. That hurts [wobbles Monica]
Oh! Well. Well, let's not do that!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
OK, now I'll kick an ass.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
I know! I know! I know!
Okay, now I'll let you go when you both stop.
Fine!
Fine!
Here we go. You know, if we were in prison you would be my bitches.
Okay, buddy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I carry everything you own.
Oh dear God!
Look at me! I am Chandler! I could
Yes.
Whew, it's hot with all that stuff on.
I ah, I do not do any, I do not know, lunges.

Hello.
Hello.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry.
I do not need a game room.
I mean, when I was a kid, I was just playing these games because I could not get girls, and now me
Stop, Chandler. I am sorry, too.
"Really?"
Yes! Oh yeah!
Ohh.
Listen, we do not have to make this a guest room, we can think of something together with the room.
That's a great idea! We can
Total!
We do not have to come up with that now.
Oh good.
Yes, and I'm fine with being a weakling.
That's great. Good for you.
I am not very low maintenance!
I am not a weakling!
Who said you were?
You did!
Oh, I'm flaky. I will say everything.

Okay, I know that will sound silly, but I think if I can, you know, if I can do my own laundry, there's nothing I can not do.
That does not sound stupid to me.
You know, it's like the first time I had to eat after Carol left me?
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
Go on Ross ... Uh-oh.
What, oh?
Oh, oh, oh, the laundry is ready.
It's, uh, it's a song.
The washcloth we sing.
Oh, oh, the laundry is done, oh-oh, oh-oh.
Ross, what's up?
Nothing nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry is ready.
Why are you here?
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had problems last time because we seem to ...
No no no ... i mean
Oh! Someone is a bit moody today because they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kids size.
What!?
That was fun! But I have to get an invasive vaginal exam!
I would like to stay, but I got ... a hot date anyway ...
Please go! Please let me know if you need a hand!
I think it just dropped off.

I do not want to be single, okay? I ... I - I just want to marry again!
And I only want a million dollars!
Rachel ?!
Yes.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us and I will not let them go!
And we are not a few fools!
I hear you, Mugsy!
But look, all these rooms are ok, okay?
Can you just pick one so I can watch - have a perfect, magical weekend with you.
OK,
Nothing! It's over! Hell again! This is a regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn off the TV? OK? Do we really want to spend the whole weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, do I disturb the fun of changing rooms?
Hey, do not blame me for wailing tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bellman, who had to carry luggage in 10 different rooms?
I do not know how about the idiot who thought he could go from Albany to Canada with half a tank of gas!
Do not talk bad about the dead.
We should spend a romantic weekend together, it - what's wrong with you?
I just want to watch a little bit of TV. What's the big deal? Gosh, mom, relax.
What did you say?
I said, "My goodness, relax, Monnnnn."

You know, maybe it's best we can never do it again.
Yes, somehow it makes that one night special. You know, technically we are still
I'm going to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there a bit?
"Kay!
May I ask you something?
Uh, no.
Felicity and I, we watch
No.
I mean, the giant is five years younger than me, you know, do you think I'll ever get there?
Yes.
Thanks man.
Okay man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, I can not get any bigger now, you know?
And who knows what science will come up in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular man?
Hey, Monica, you've been in the bathroom for half an hour.
I know!
Had the beef tops, right?

Goodbye and god speed, Hope Brady.
Not so fast Wesley!
Remoray!
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that you are not a real doctor! And the brain of this woman is fine!
Oh! Thank God!
To hope! To hope!
Drake!
You do not die hope, you will live a long, healthy life. With me.
Oh, Drake.
OK!
Here we go!
OK!
Hello, Joey!
It's Rachel!
Um, I'm free tomorrow night.
Yes, sure, I can bring sandwiches.

OK, we have the coleslaw, we have the rolls ...
We have the minced meat of once cute cows and turkeys, ew ...
Men are here.
Mom, would you relax?
It was 10 blocks from here, and those, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that.
Mom, come on, stop worrying.
This is a safe road, this is a safe building, there is nothing
Hello.
Hi, hello can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for Phoebe, is she still living here?
Uh, no, she does not, but I can, I can send her a message.
Great. Uh, just tell her, her husband came by.
What?
Hey, how, how did you do that?

Okay, somebody.
OK, I will go. OK, last year's college ... on a pool table.
Whoooaa!
This is my sister.
OK ... my strangest place would be ... the women's room on the second floor of the New York City Public Library.
Oh dear God! What did you do in a library?
Pheebs, what about you?
Oh ... Milwaukee.
Um ... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, "It's a little world after all."
Under no circumstance!
The ride has collapsed.
Well, Carol and I went behind some of these mechanical Dutch kids ... then they repaired the ride and we were asked never to return to the magical kingdom.
Oh, Rachel.

Hello!
Hello!
Oh, is the game over?
Yes. Where were you?
Thank you for your patience, you are the next caller.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You have to go crazy.
No. I was busy.
Oh, okay, yes. I put your things in her room and her things in your room.

Well, there it is. And, you know, yesterday.
Yes, no, I'm telling you, Rachel has such a good eye for this stuff.
Ross, you know, if you ever decide that you have to renovate - and I think you should.
You should, you should ask Rachel for help.
Oh darling, he does not need my help.
Oh come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call that? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Really?!
Hey, you know something?
Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here it is - here are $ 60, why do not you bring Phoebe to your colonial flea market and bring me some stuff.
You know what? I do not think Phoebe really wants it.
No! I would like!
Oh, she wants it.
She wants it.
Yes!

Wow, you have beautiful feet.
These old things.
If you would mind spending some time in my syadic area, it killed me today.
You mean siadic's okay, you mean the towel-covered part.
Yes.
Sure, yes, no, I know that, yes, because you know that the muscles in the Siadian realm can become known to you, really nice and tight.
So, um, tell me Rick, how, um, how did you hurt the area?
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Oh.
Ow! Did you just bite me?
No!

Um, that's it.
No.
Hello!
You!
J.
Man of the crew.
Yes.
Why are you following me?
I mean, the whole week I'm watching, you're there.
You would not reciprocate my phone calls, you sent my letters back ....
What?
Another chance Ursula, please?
OK.

Okay, and then this is the coffee house. Here I play my music.
Good business.
May I help you.
Many Thanks.
Hello!
Hello! Alright, let's go shopping !!
Uh, you know, before we go ah, there's something I have to say.
Oh ok.
I somehow had this ah, this one will crush you.
But since you've been with Ross, I have not done anything about it.
But now that you are not, I would like to ask you someday.
So-so is that - that's what I'm doing now.
Impressive! Umm ....
I dropped a cup.

Hello, tiny embryos.
Well, I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi!
I am - I hope I will be your womb for the next nine months.
You should know that we are doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you were there!
Um, you know, they want you so much, so if you get in there, really accept.
Okay, and - and I promise I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to take you home, oh!
And also, next time you see me, I scream, do not worry, that's what's going to happen.
Ready?
Uh-huh. Good luck.

We are baack!
Hello!
What do you do together?
Joey and Janice
Really.
Yes / Yes.
We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman.
You have a competition buddy.
I just came over to give you a kiss, I have to pick up the baby, so.
See you later, honey, you too Chandler.
You still can not stand it, right?
I'm sorry, man, I'm tired, I've really done that.
Well, you know, I appreciate that you tried.
But, hey, look, you know, the good thing is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's more amazing, she did too.
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.
You told him to play the boxer gay !!
Well, I - I could have said Supergay.
You were crazy about him.
Joey, you are the teacher of this boy. I mean, how could you do that?
Because, Monica, the guy is so good and I really, really want that part.
Well, if you really want it, it's okay.

Then we have to wait for data from recent MRI scans and DNA tests that challenge information from years of simple carbon dating.
Look at this woman who sits by the pool and tans ... so leathery and wrinkled, it's me
I am not your brother.
What about my kids Drake ?! Huh! No!! No!! No! God!
Why do not we try to massage the breast to stimulate the flow?
Are you kidding me?!
It's just so frustrating! Why does not she want my breast ?!
I dont know! Maybe she is crazy!

Hey Joey, I have beer for you.
Uh, do not you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen, I would order a pizza, do you want to share one?
Pizza, heh, it's not like I've never had it before ... ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is something wrong?
All right, all right, let's just bring it out, okay?
You're hot.
I am adorable.
Obviously, there is an atmosphere between us.
But we are roommates and it is a big mistake for us to go this way.
Joey ...
Oh no it is not, no it is not. It's a first date. I am
Oh.
Ho-oh, he'll get something!
From the glow of street lighting from his apartment.
You know, um, he closed the curtains there so he could have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.
Well, I'm going to bed!

You were so funny with the waiter! You are such a nut!
You know, breadstick teeth are always funny.
No, you make her funny. You are the funny!
Uhh, look Katie, listen, we - we have to talk.
OK?
Um, look, I like you.
II really do, I like you a lot.
OK?
But sometimes, when you play it, when you play me so playfully - it feels like someone is hitting me with a very small but very strong punch
Aww, as if I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my height? Do not make fun of me because of my size!

Oh, Joey! We are sorry!
They have made you head of the department!
No, I can teach one of his advanced courses! Why did not I get head of department?
Oh! Hey Rach, listen
Yes.
I have a big date, do you know a good restaurant?
Uh, Paul's cafe. They have great food and it is very romantic.
Ooh, great! Many Thanks!
Yes! Oh, and then you can go to them
You sure call many ways to postpone sex, I'll tell you
Ooh, I miss the dating.
Get ready and go to a fancy restaurant.
I will not be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun!
I do not mean that it's not funny to sit at home and worry about giving birth to a 16-pound baby.
Hey, you know something?
Huh?
Why do not I bring you out?
What?! Joey, you do not want to go out with a pregnant woman.
Yes I will!
And we'll go out, we'll have a good time and distract you from the birth and the C-sections - and huge baby heads that reach out
OK! I will go with you! I will go! I will go with you.
I will have fun.
Well?

Hello!
Hello!
Joey, I have to tell you, I've been thinking
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and ... and my co-star is good
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Au, I'm just going over the script! Do you want to read lines with me?
Me? Oh no, I'm not an actress.
Oh, okay, I can ask Monica.
Oh, fuck her, this part is mine!
Right ... ok, just from the beginning of the page, right here.
OK. , Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
I can not believe you married him.
But what choice did I have? He held my sister in one
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
It's over! you
How can I?
Knowing that I will never hold you in my arms again or touch your skin or feel your lips, knowing that I will never sleep with you?
How can I accept that ...
I can never kiss you again, if it's all I can do to avoid kissing you now.
Kiss Me.
What?

Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you have the bigger half. What do you want?
The bigger half.
I would like to suggest a toast.
Little toast here, ding thing.
I know that's not the kind of Thanksgiving you all planned, but it was really great for me, you know, I think because there was no divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I just thought, I mean, if you had gone to Vail and if you had been with your family, if you had no syphilis and such, we would not all be together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all your thanks have sucked.
This is so cute.
And hey, this is a lousy Christmas.
And a crappy new year.
Here here!

Now, wait!
Please wait!
Look, look, your daughter and I should leave our honeymoon tonight, now - now you - tell her that I will be at the airport and I hope she will be there too!
Oh yes, I said Rachel's name, but it meant nothing, okay?
She is just a friend and that's all!
That's all!
Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can not imagine spending my life with someone else.
Please promise me that you will tell her that.
Alright, I'll tell her. Come on, dumbass!
Call me.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why do not you ever get out of the damn window?

What happened?!!
Well, I do not know !!
We fell asleep! That's all.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Alright, well, I'm going better.
I think that would be best.
Yes. Well, I'll talk to you later.
OK. But not about it!
No! Never! Never! Bye.
No touch! No touch!

Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I have some bad news. I do not think I can move to Tulsa.
What?
It's actually a funny story.
I fell asleep in the meeting this morning when I said that I would move to Tulsa, I did not really know what I was saying.
You fell asleep?
But just because I was awake all night because of this meeting, is not that funny?
Irony?
No fan, alright.
You see, here's the thing.
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she will not go.
Look, I, I love Tulsa!
Tulsa is heaven!
Tulsa is Italy - Please, do not take me there!
Kramer, I ...
No no no!
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
W-why would I, if you're called Elaine?
Oh, what a great picture of your son!
This is a picture of your daughter, is not it, she is pretty.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.
I'm calling you from Tulsa.

Hello.
Hello.
How are you?
I am not too bad. Fortunately, blue is my color. How did you know that I was here?
Because ... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you used.
I was not expecting that.
I want you to know, it was not me who brought you in.
Oh. Many Thanks.
No thanks! You have given me so much! I mean, if you were not, I would never have been able to sing
Well, actually you just had to sing 'memo'.
I just can not believe you're here.
I mean, what will I do without you?
Who will let the embassy parties collapse with me?
Who will take me?
Uh ... Oh, Mindy, you're so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What do you think?
Do you smell familiar?
Oh no.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
No, I'm so sorry ...
Oh my.

Well, no way will I get a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle and stab in my mouth, you know, like a Thirty Gun.
Doctor, can I see you briefly please? My brother is a little afraid of needles.
Did you tell him about my idea as a Thirty Gun?
My brother, the doctor wants to know if there is a way to treat it orally.
No, under these circumstances it must be an injection, and it must be now.
Tho?
Oh.
That's good, sit down.
Um, the doctor says it has to be a needle.
You just have to be brave, ok?
Can you do that for me?
OK.
OK. Oh boy. You are doing so well. Do you want to press my hand?
Yes!
OK.
All right, Ross, do not squeeze it so hard.
Honey, really, do not squeeze it so hard!
Oh, Ross!
Let my hand go!

You will love me so much. I got sting tickets !!
Oh dear God! I really love you! How did you do it ?!
Well, let's just say
Oo, where are the seats?
Er, middle balcony.
You are a mean old woman.
No! Wait, no! Shut up - I mean, do not cry! Let me get my checkbook!
Look, you do not have to do that, okay?
It's the strength you have inside that matters most to me.
You are loyal, you are honest and you have integrity!
That's the kind of strength I want to have in the man I love!
That does not mean anything to me. Come on!

Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
: Hello.
: What do you do?
Um. Oh! I'm so sorry. It's a bit old, though
: No! You plug the slide, which I plugged for half an hour!
I'm so sorry. I do not have - I do not get much in here.
: Oh yes, of course not!
No.
: Because you are a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza Daddy, buy me a confectionery factory Daddy, make the cast
I did not say that.
: You think you could make a mess and the big man in overalls will come in and clean it up, right?
Well, why do not you think of someone else for a change?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Hello!
What's this?
Oh, right, that girl's phone number.
Yes, yes, there it is, just a phone number that gave me a really hot girl.
It's not a big deal, I mean it's her home phone number, but ... Wow!
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
Yes, dear Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop her.
Many Thanks.

I do not know how one of them opened?!
You opened them all?
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler will never trust me again!
Oh hello! You have the gift of my parents!
Yes. What's this?
Well, I do not know. I think it makes a difference to the salami.
Hello! How did it go?
Yes. What did day say?
Day is not the father! And Joey knows it now?
I'm doing revenge. I do it and I'm so happy for you.
Oh wow, you did not even try to unhook my bra!
So you will ever tell whoever it is?
No, I will. I'm just not ready tonight.
Hey Rach, listen, no matter what that guy says, I want you to know you're not alone.
I'm not?
Look, I'm, it's a scary world out there, especially if you're a single mom.
You know, I always felt like you and I have that - this particular bond.
You know?
So, Rachel Green, do you want to marry me?
Many Thanks.
If I can not have it, you can not have it!

I can not believe her, you know, it's easy - it's so typical.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but do not forget it.
There will be a wedding, you will throw the bouquet, and
Paris?
We will take a moonlit walk on Rue de la.
Continue talking.
Then we will sprinkle pedals on the bed and make love. Not only because it's romantic, but because I can!
I love you!

Yes!
I win again!
Haha!
That's $ 500 you owe me!
Whoo-ho-hoo!
$ 500, that's a lot of electricity!
Whoo-ho-ho!
I need to eat something.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. OK? Sudden death, one goal, $ 1,000.
Are you serious?
Oh yeah!
Okay, get ready to thank me!
OK.
Okay, here we are. Ready?
No! No! No! Nobody can defeat me.
See? Well, that's why only the little fake men should do anything.

Who is this?!
Do not worry, I'm brave!
I am brave!
I am brave!
No no no no!!
Can you please tell me who is there?
Hello!
Hello. Do you know what time it is?
It's sweets time! My roommate says they taste like little drops of the sky.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Small drops of the sky.
4:00.
So, can I get sweets?
I'm sorry, but some of us have to
Um, listen, I'm sorry, but I'll get something out tomorrow morning.
Okay, I'll drop by later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.
Mm! Apparently I would have remembered you!
Mm! Night Gar '!

Aaron! You have to let me go. The guy has hammered!
I'm sorry, Joey, as long as he's here and he knows we're still shooting.
You would not happen to have a very big fork?
Well, um, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Well, did we finish the scene?
Yes! You, you were wonderful.
As you were.
So I have your car, it's right outside.
Why? Are we ready for the day?
You told me that.
Oh thank you. You're welcome.
No no no! We must go! Come on! Here we go.
Is that my ass?

What about these? These look the same?
Certainly!
Not like everyone else!
Oh, then no.
Hello!
Hello!
Ready?
Yes.
You look amazing. I am the happiest man in the world.
Ohh, you will have a bit more luck.
Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings
They look great! Does your friend have the best taste or what?
My friend has really good taste!
Thank you for choosing the earrings man.
Hm-mmm.

I know that there is no hole, I just liked this picture.
Oh dear God! Look at that!
Okay, but there
I do not care! The wires have dissolved in your head!
I just thought if I could follow the cable, I could figure out what it did.
And do you have ?!
No. It disappears behind the baseboard. For a minute there I thought it was going down.
But it did not. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh dear God.
Hi sweetheart.
Hello, Mrs Chatracus.

Okay, is everyone clear? We will pick it up and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We will
Ross, I really do not think so
Elevator !! And slip!
Okay, here we are.
Alright, lift! And slip !!

Alright Carl, we're the next. Now remember, what will not be?
Another
Right! And what will not you do?
Well, I will not talk because
I mean, I know that his feelings will never quite disappear, but
Oh my Gawd, I - I understand.
I'm sorry, I'll go.
Goodbye Monica, I wish you a happy life with him.
Chandler, you call me when it's in the shit.

Yes?
I found my identical hand twin!
Oh, it's you
No!
But she has just come up here!
That was Joey!
I wonder where she is. That's so funny.
Yes, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop it?
Do you want to know the first thing she said when she came back from having lunch with Richard?
She did not feel anything for him.
She loves You!
"Really?"
Yes! Now she feels terrible! She really wants to reconcile herself! You have to find her.
OK.
Well. I really should start wearing hats!

I mean, why should I let her take him?
I mean, I'll bring a guy home and they'll be over him in five minutes.
I mean, they're like coyotes, sorting out the weak members of the herd.
Listen.
As someone who has seen more than their fair share of bad beef, I will tell you: this is not such a terrible thing.
I mean, they are your friends, they just take care of you.
I know. I only wish that I would bring home a guy they really liked.
Well, you realize that the chances are a little lower if you never meet the guy.

No no no no. Hello!
Anyway, I should go. Okay bye.
Hey sweetie.
Hi sweety. So, what about all the whispers?
I can not tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people should not have secrets among themselves. We have too much love and respect for each other.
Awww. But still not.
No, I'm serious, we should tell each other
"Really?" Okay, so why do not you tell me what happened to Ross Junior?
Oh no, I can not.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
OK.
OK.
Ross and I are leaving
Oh dear God. He threw up?
No, he visited a small town south of him. What was Phoebe's secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place gets fired.
That's it?! I gave up mine
Right! You lose the sucker !! Please still marry me.

Ahhh! Oh nice!
My God!
Oh hello! How was your audition?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What do you do?
Nothing, I just blow you out, because I'm going to be a big movie star!
Oh! You have it?!
Well, no, not yet. But the audition went really well.
What was that for?
Oh, it's this big-budget movie about these three Italian brothers coming to America around the turn of the century.
It's really great!
Oh, and the director should be next next Martin Scorcese.
The next next?
Yeah, is that guy from Chicago, who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, okay?
But then this guy is right behind him.
Hello!
You loved me!
Oh dear God!
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay, let me call you back.
What's happening?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Impressive!
I know! My grandmother will see that!
Grandma has to come in line.

Oh please! It was such a great class! You never noticed me!
What? Of course I have! You, uh, you're sitting next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
Oh, um, I had trouble remembering everyone's name so I came up with nicknames.
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly from Brownshirt.
Oh yeah. So, do you have a nickname for me?
Eh, no. No.
Of course you have! What was it?
Um, it's Cutie McPretty.
Oh, that's so cute!
Listen, I have to tell you, I - I have a great time!
You know, as you said earlier, it could be weird, the whole thing with the student teacher, and to be honest, I thought it was, but that's not it.
I mean it is not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Burt!

Okay, so we got some good rejections, a lot of work.
Okay, shoot.
Okay, um, the zoo spot.
I did not understand it?
No. You said you were not believable as a human being. So, you can work on it.
Okay, what else?
Um, the Off-Broadway people said, "You were pretty, but stupid."
Oh.
Oh no, wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty stupid'.
Hello.
How is the crazy one?
Oh, well, he is delicious. We kissed a bit.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know, he's not in this stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Pheebs, this guy is obsessed with your sister, because God knows how long, okay, you do not just give up like that.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
You take the word of a man who has night vision goggles?
What, he still does not follow her. Do you think he still follows her?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the injunction.
What can I say?
I think if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thank you, Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he is going.
Oh, I would do that, forget me.

Hey guys, look at it! My mother sent me the newspaper!
Ooh, let's see it!
Ahhh.
Ah!
She is not crazy, right?
No.
So how are you?

There he is!
There is our star!
So, what did you think?
Almost as good as the game with the two naked girls on the seesaw.
I - I was not there.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian woman who lives in mine.
So you know it?
The postman was down, so I picked up your mail.
Oh good. Many Thanks.
What is Fabutec?
Okay, do not judge me too much.
OK?
Um, but I've seen this info shop, and um, I swear I've never bought anything on TV except for this mop.
But there was this stuff growing on my leg, it just looked so great ....
Waxine !!
Yes! Did you see it?
Oh, it's incredible! I want to be such a Waxine girl.
I know!!
God. Do you really think it does not hurt? How can they do that?
Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rainforest!
They have the best stuff in there.

Come on. Move.
Oh sorry. I used this machine somehow.
Yes, well, now you are not.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, is this your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I do not see soapy water.
What?
No soapy water, no storage. OK?
What's going on here?
Hi, uh, nothing. This terrible woman has just taken my machine.
Was your basket up?
Yes, but, there was no soap suds.
So?
Well, you know, no soap suds, no rescue.
No soap suds? Excuse me, hold on for a second. This is the machine of my friend.
Hey, hey, hey, your things were not in there.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Because it is good money! But that does not change the fact that this is a bad bloodsucker!
Well, I think that's a great place to work!
Ok, are you listening?

Varrrrrroom!
Hello!
Look at it, lady!
Varrrrrrrrrrom!
Hey-hey, good-looking!
Varrrrrrrrroom.
Good, I'll go.
My bed is so boring.

Ross, you know, this is the first time in my life that I'm doing something that really matters to me.
This is the first time in my life that I'm doing something that I'm really good at.
I mean.
if you do not get that ...
No, hey, I understand that, okay, I'm getting this big time.
And I'm happy for you, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!
Okay, I do not remember what to do.
Neither do I!
Hello!
I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss something?
Joey stuffs 15
fifteen? Your personal best! (Ross stops
Where were you?
Oh, on a date. Yes, I met this girl on the train when I went to a museum.
Oh yeah! How did you meet her?
Oh, which museum?
No, answer him.
Okay, it was only me and her in the back of the train, and I was sitting near the door, so she'd have to pass me if she wanted to change cars.
She was completely at my mercy.
Were you so late because you deburred this woman?
No, I go back because she lives in Poughkeepsie.
She seems really great, but she is really great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
How can she be great when she comes from Poughkeepsie? That joke would have killed Albany.
Done! I did it! Hey, who is stupid now?

No, there is no way! It can
Why is your family?
He can not play at our wedding!
I mean, everyone will go!
I mean, come on, that's just noise!
It is not even a song!
If you listen very carefully, I think so

Oh, I want to look too! , Yikes!
So you think these pictures - are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, sure.
I mean, as in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she screams, "Where are they, where are they?"
Well, she will not see her lying in the grass like that.
Oh yeah. Oh, do you remember the days when you went to the barn, lifted your shirt and bent over?
Yes.
You see, now I would go out with this girl.
She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.
I mean, that has to come in handy
Okay, I have a question. If you had to choose one of us, who would that be?
I dont know.
Neither do I.
Rachel.
What?!
I dont know. Neither do I.

Listen, I wanted to tell you - I'm sorry you lost.
Listen, I have a secret for you. I let him win.
Is this a secret or a lie?
No, I let him win - Ross!
Yes?
Would you tell her that I let you win?
Oh. Yes. Uh Chandler
I am strong! I will show you!
Chandler please!
Oh, what's going on? Are you scared?
Let's go a big hare!
OK. 1 2 3-Go! I will kill myself!

Hey Ross, is Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten
Oh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Impressive! You realize that we threw that ball without dropping it for an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yes. I noticed it half an hour ago, but I did not want to say anything because I did not want to hex it.
Impressive! We are pretty good at it! Hello! We totally forgot lunch!
Oh, I-I think that's the first time I miss a meal! Yes, my pants are a bit loose!
Hey guys
Hello!

Who is it?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hello!
Oh God. So, you're doing porn.
No I'm not.
You make one now!
And-
Yes, can I help you with something?
Listen, I'm talking! You are - you mean it.
You know, Gemini stuff is always a real bestseller.
What?!
Yes, I can tell you that they give you $ 30.
No!!
Under no circumstance!
No!
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!
And shame on you all!
You are disgusting!
Especially you!

Hello!
Hello Pheebs!
Are you moving out?
No, not all my suitcases are. This is Paolo's.
Um, Rachel, can we talk for a second?
Well, sure ... just a second, because Paolo is on his way there.
Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs ...
Ok, um, we have not known each other for a long time and there are three things you should know about me.
One, my friends are the most important in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal cookies in the world.
Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my god, why have not I ever tried them ?!
Oh, I do not do them much, because I do not think it's fair to the other cookies
Alright, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.
I assume you do not do it.
Paolo bumped into me.

I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking.
I do not freak out.
Why should I go crazy?
A woman named Heldi phoned and said we were getting married, but that happens every day.
Honey, we were in this beautiful place and I-I-I just wrote down our names for fun!
I mean, what's wrong with that?
Exactly here!
Chandler, please do not think I've tried to pressurize you. Phoebe and Rachel
Phoebe and Rachel!
The people who knew about our wedding were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi and apparently a band called Starlight Magic 7, which by the way is reachable!
There was an error. Please do not take this because it is not.
OK.
"Really?"
Yes, if it really means nothing, because you know that I'm just not ready
I know! I know.
OK.
I'll tell Joey that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Hey, did she buy it?
Total.
Did Heldi show you the place?
Yes it is beautiful.
I can not believe that you will ask Monica to marry you!
I know.

No phoebe!
You can not get the phone this way; that's not fair!
Okay, look, I have an idea.
Why not us, why do not we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then we can say who has more in common with him.
And who does that, gets the phone.
Or we can decide whose name is getting closer to the word phone.
I do not think so.
All right, but I'll bet you would sing a different tune if we were arguing for a ratchet.
Alright, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mother to suicide.
Okay, you can not use that to get the sweet guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Did I use that today? I'm so sorry.
Yes, good.
Well, you see, that does not tell us anything.
Joe.
Carlos.
Peter.
Oh!
Peter Luger!
This is a steak house!
Okay, a meat eater. Good, that's one for you.
Oh, I win! He has
You do not know that
His new girlfriend!

I can not believe that. Do you think your parents could pay for it?
I do not know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
She saves the rest for her divorce.
And any extra money my dad can save on his annual trips
Well, what happened at dinner?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
My God! What did you order?!
Wait, but there is no money! Well, that's terrible! You have to marry like in a, rec. Center!
Honey, everything will be fine.
No! No it is not! It will not be good! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
No, do you know something?
Everything is going to be alright.
I mean, you do not have to have this rustic Italian feast.
You know?
And - and you do not need, you do not need this tailored, empire waist, duchess, satin dress; You can wear the rack.

Dr. Geller, here is a seat.
Thanks, dr. Phillips, but I eat here at this table, here in the middle.
I'm having lunch with my good friend Joey when he sits down with me.
I will sit with you Geller.
You know, we work in a natural history museum, and yet the way we eat lunch is unnatural.
Now I look around the cafeteria, and you know what I see, I see - I see separation.
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I wonder, "My God why ?!"
Well, I say we lost these - those coats that separate us, and we get to know the people below.
I am Ross!
I am divorced, and I have a child!
I am Joey! I am an actor! I do not know how to squat over dinosaurs!
I'm Ted, I moved here a month ago and New York really scares me.
Alright, let's go!
Yes, you are hanging Teddy there!
I am Andrew and I did not pay for this pear.
Okay, good - good for you.
I am Rhonda, and these are not real!
Wow, Rhonda.
I am Scott.
Yes, okay, Scott!
And I have to turn the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family dies.

So thank you for the warm welcome.
It's good to have you on my team and I'm coming to play.
I hope you do it too.
Let's go and get her!
Huh?
And remember, there is no ego in the team.
Yes, but there are two in Martini, so all together
You! Cuckoo! What's your name?
Oh, it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry, I was just ah ...
No, no, I heard what you said, funny.
I like funny.
This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun.
Nice to have you on board!

Yes. You will not be able to take it.
Well, well, this little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what will they call her?
They will call her Chandler.
This is a male name, do not you think?
Works on you.

Oh, that's so cute.
No, no, ok, you're hanging up.
Ok, ok, one, two, three.
Well, you did not hang up either.
She did not play either ...
Ok, no, no, you're hanging up. You you you-
Ross, hi, it's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that everything is alright and I'm really happy for you and yours
Rach, I got a message from you.
Oh dear God.
Oh my God, Ross, no, stop it, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me that.
,
,
You are over me?
Ohhhhhhhh god.
Wa ... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ohh, ohh.
When, when were you ... under me?
Well, basically lately I have uh, i had feelings for you.
OK, I have to lie down.

Hello! I'm in, they let me audition!
"Really?" That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies actually saw me in one piece, so I turned away from her
(notices a child who has a copy of
Oh yes, yes! He has made tons of commercials. I saw him in Sugar Smacks,
Yes, he will not get that.
Ben is a lot nicer than the kid.
I mean, look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, would not it be great if I could play Ben's dad?
Joey, you do not look like Ben.
I look more like him than you!
You know, I do not know you well enough to do that.

That was really one of your best works.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can not believe that I have only two hours before I get sick due to work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, you will not believe that, but if you have seven minutes to spare
Really?!
Do you want?
OK! You get the vacuum cleaner and I will get the furniture polish!

Oh ok. But, you know what? Danger. Because a guy who helped me before had to leave because he had hurt his back.
Friend?
No.
I am Joey.
Kristen.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Kristen.
I have it! So
So, do you live here?
Yes!
Yes!
Right down there.
Hey, listen; Let me give you a little tip.
Do not take a nap on this staircase or you can wake up with your shoes off.
I will remember that.
OK. Yes. Listen, would you, would you have dinner with me tonight?
Oh, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
But tomorrow?
Sounds good! Okay, well, where is this going?
You look strong, why do not I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
OK. Yes. Yes, I take this.

Hello.
Listen, um ...
I'm so sorry.
: Yeah, um ... You know yourself, you should just forget what I said under the bridge, I was talking
That's right, I do not ... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Okay, so it will not work.
If it were, would you stop hanging around with her?
Um, it's because of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either you or me.
You know ... you will really come across very, very hard.

By the way, in the week before your wedding you might not see much of me.
Oh, hello liar.
Listen, I - I'm really sorry that I let go of the bike.
I could have been killed, I hope you know it!
I know. I know. But can we try again? Huh? I mean, it was you
Well, I would like to, but the bike was stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe.
What?! What the hell?!
Alright, you know what?
If you do not learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I just have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
Because! Because, it's like you have this guitar and never play it. Okay, this guitar
Well. If you worry enough to make up for that load of crap, okay?
Great! Great! You make the bike very happy.
Okay Ross! Please do not die!

How could you keep all this away from me?
I wanted to tell you, but
But what?! You thought you would get what you wanted and then kicked them out as if you had dropped Rachel!
Hello! I did not throw Rachel away! We are still together. Can I just why do not we just leave that to the machine?
Hello Ross. It's Joey. Here's a hooker and we thought you might know something about it.
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-II-I-I have to, I have to lie down.

Everything on your application looks really good - ohh!
Only one last question. Um, are you and your friends here all the time, celebrating and hanging out?
Oh, do not worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Wow !! Look, do not be just nonsense. I want you to really think about your answers. OK?
You can cancel the roommate search! Hello! I will live here.
Oh, do not listen to him, he's just a guy who really wants the apartment, but I do not think he'll get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
The thing was a danger! I am very security conscious.

Hello.
Hey man, how was the audition going?
Estelle said I did not understand.
What?! Why? Joey, you were so ready!
Yeah, I thought so, too, but she said the casting people have some issues with me.
No!
As far as I know, she's trying to find me, but could not because I moved on.
No, from now on I will stay in one place.
Exactly here.
Well, it's getting late.
Yes, we will go.
Do you really think you can stay here for a while?
Uh, you know, we have to get up early and take the plane to New York.
Yes, it is a very big plane.
That's cool.
But we stay here with you.
Thanks, people! I really appreciate that, you know, but you do not have to rub my butt.

Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
You are not a couple!
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Okay, look, let me ask you a question when they did it on stage, was it really hot?
Oh yeah!
All right, then you're alright.
The rule is, when two actors really do it off the stage, all the sexual tension between them is gone.
OK?
As long as it's hot on the stage, you do not need to worry.
It's when the heat is gone, then you're in trouble.
"Really?"
Look, you've been in every track I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
No.
No !!

Ursula! Waiting! Err-er, it's me! Phoebe!
Oh, I thought there was a mirror. OK Bye.
A moment! What's new with you?
Um, nothing. I mean, I will marry next week.
And your breasts! Hmm !!!
OK.
Um, look, you come a bit strong.
But I will give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems that the universe really wants to be together.
So, why do not we just start from scratch?
And you can only tell me about you.
Well.
OK.
I write erotic novels for children.
What?!
They are very unpopular.
Oh dear God!
Oh, you may also be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Impressive! They do?
Yes, a pretty big one
Well.

So, how is she?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How are you, Mom?
Me? I'm fine, fine. I am glad that you are here. ... what about your hair?
What?
What is different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She is incredible, our mother is ...
Okay, relax, relax.
We will be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have friends and your career to cover.
Oh God!
The fluffy little mints at the bottom of her handbag.
Oh!
Yes, they were disgusting.
Oh, do you know what I loved?
Her sweet 'n' lot.
Like she always stole her from the restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Could be.
You can not!
Why? Seriously, I did not understand a word that you said.
In the hall.

Well, yease, most people, when their pets move on, want them to lie like they're sleeping.
But sometimes you get your person who wants her in a pose.
For example, chasing her tail, or, um, jumping to catch a Frisbee.
Joey, when I go first, I want to search for my keys.
That's a good one!
Hello Joe.
Dad, Ronni is here.
Huh?

So, now, these are all tuxedos we do, and if there is something you like, we can make you a deal.
Everything at all.
But those are the three that Monica approved before.
Well, thank you for connecting with Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I am Monica's maid of honor. OK? Do not try to put me on the blue needle!

Oh here, I think that's us. Yes.
Limited seats my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hello!
I am Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Used to work with her. Used to! I am a relative and I was not invited! ON
Stop stranger saying "Blood".
So, what about you, right? How do you know the happy couple?
Okay, you're fine.

Monica, why did you bring me here ?!
You'll see.
I tell you, this wedding will not happen.
Oh God.
OK? But - imagine a lot more lights, okay? And - and you know less stones, and - and - and flowers and candles
And the musicians, look, they can go over here, okay? And the chairs can look that way, and you go.
But - but if you do not love it, we do it in every other place at any other time.
Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
It's perfect.
And I do not know if it starts to rain
Well then we get wet.
Ohh. And I do not even have a date.

Come.
I have to pick a bone with you.
Oh oh.
Yes! Ben has learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old?
Right! Right!
Oh that.
Yes, that! You know, I hate practical jokes! They are mean and they are stupid and - and I do not want my son to learn them!
You know what? It does not matter! Because it is not true!
OK.
And if it were true, how
Mrs. Monroe Oh, let's go.

Mark is a genius!
Why?! As?! How is he a genius?
Look, do not you see what happens here?
Instead of meeting her immediately, he becomes her confidant.
Now he'll be the guy she's complaining about you too.
What should I do?
Why do not you send her a musical mistake, Op, no, you've already done that.
All right, you'll have to go there yourself, okay, make a few surprise visits.
I do not know you.
Alright, do nothing, just sit here and talk to us while she talks to you about you.
And he's Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts to think, "Maybe that's the guy for me, because he understands me."
And before you know it, she's with him.
And you will be everything, 'Oh, man!'
And he will be everything, 'yes!'
And we'll be like, 'Whoa, buddy.'
And soon you will be like "Hhiii", and, and, "I can not go, Rachel and Mark could be there."
And we'll say, "You'll get over it, it's been four years !!"
He paints a good picture, right?

That's what I've done for the party so far, alcoholic. Get a lot of alcohol.
Great. Great.
Okay, well, regarding the invitation list, I have you, me, and Chandler, and I'm going to invite Gunther because we talked pretty loud about it.
I'll be there.
Alright - oh!
Listen, I know that's your party, but I really would like to see the number of museum freaks that will be there.
Yes. Say something, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, just the dinosaur types!
OK! We need a six pack of
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Hey, you know, if you do that, if you call him Joey, you should call him Chandler.
Oh come on!
Chandler is funny, cultivated and he is very lovable once you get to know him.
Well, hey, Joey is also adorable! But the thing with Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, well, maybe he's a bit late, but - but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you some cold soda if you need him because you're really hot.
What are you saying? What are you saying?
Well, I like the idea of ​​naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
But well, I do not know - maybe I'll just call him The Hulk.
I knew I should not have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to call my child!

What Rachel did for her life ... We met her parents at the club, they did not play well.
I will not tell you what they spent for this wedding ... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar ...
What does this mean?
Nothing! It is an expression.
No it is not.
Do not listen to your mother.
You are independent and you have always been!
Even when you were a child ... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were fine!
And you are reading alone in your room and your puzzles ...

PBS Telethon.
Hello Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
I
$ 200? Are you sure, Pheebs? I mean, after what
Oh, I'm still mad at you, but I'm also doing good luck to many children whose mothers did not kill themselves, so by supporting them I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
What kind of problem?
Well, to tell the truth, they had a problem with the bag!
Oh dear God!
Nooooo!
You know what? It was a stupid game anyway!
You know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I do not want to give up the bag.
I do not have to give up the bag!
Do I have revenge?
Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey, wait, Joey, I'm sorry, I mean, how great I think you are
Oh hello!
I just do not know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can not believe I hear that!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I'm not saying that you should not have a bag, I - only there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Yes, um, they are called purses.

I think you will find this room more to your liking.
OK great.
They say he only has half a tank left.
Half a tank? We still have high speed hunting!
We change the rooms again.
What? Why?
This is a room overlooking the garden and we paid for a sea view room.
Our last sea view was unacceptable for you.
Excuse me, um, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh-huh.
Chandler!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey !!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey !!
Oh. Oh, did I wake you up?

Hello!
Hello! Oh, I just wanted to go. I-II-I-I did not think you were coming.
Oh, I would not miss that.
Well, I am very glad that you are here.
Oh, you are such a gentleman. Come on! We go to me!

Hello!
Hey-hey.
Are the boys doing well?
Yes, we talked and Monica made me see that I overreacted and some things in life are more important.
Do you have a minute?
Well, of course, what's going on?
I was asked twice today when I came to lunch from boys.
Really?!
Yes. Did you tell someone that I'm gay?
Oh, did not you want people to know that?
But I am not gay. And I would especially not want you to think that I'm gay.
Why is this?
I do not think I should say it.
Oh, you can say that. Come on, I do not want you to feel like you can not tell me.
OK.
"Kay.
Well
Yes.
I would like to ask your friend Phoebe.
Yes, she is gay.

May I help you.
Great! Well, I'll call you later.
Great!
Hey Hey Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. We are going out tonight.
Get out, huh? Impressive! Impressive! So it did not work out with Kathy, did it? Spree.
No, Kathy is fine. I'm eating late tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Yes / Yes. And the craziest thing is that I only ate a whole pizza alone!
Waiting! You go out with Kathy!
Yes. Why are you so excited?
Well, I'm upset - for you. I mean, sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilled for you.
What's the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Look, Joey, Kathy obviously does not fulfill your emotional needs.
But Casey, I admit, I just saw the back of her head, but I feel like she - she's smart and weird and picks you up.
Do you have that all at the back of your mind?
All right, I think it's time for you to settle down. You know? Make a selection, choose a track.
Who is Elaine?

Can not you see me ?!
So, will you talk to him?
I do not know Rach.
Oh come on! I'll give you ten
On! No ten! You said ten! You can not take that back!

Hello!
Hello!
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your TV?
We need a porn break.
We spent the last two hours seeing In & Out & In, Again.
Well, why do not you just turn it off?
Because then we would be the types who turn off Free Porn.
Ooh, well, you hear it! OK.
Hello!
Hello!
Well, what-what'cha is there?
Oh, well, I'm glad you asked.
Well, do not you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
Ahh!
Now I know what you think
Pregnant woman kills four?
Phoebe, they did not let you pay for it, did they?
No!
Are you sure?
No!
Honey, you're not going to make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
No, I know that, but I just have to earn enough money for the second part of my plan.
What is the second part of your plan?

Yes that's right.
Why?
I tiredly attacked two women, did not work.
What?!
No, I mean, it's okay, I mean, they are - they are my friends.
In fact, I was married to one of them.
Let me catch this heterosexual man, you attacked your ex-wife ?!
Oh no!
No no!
No I'm tired!
But I could not.
Because of that, I'm here.
Maybe we could attack them together?
That - that's a no.

What? No! No, I will not stop. I am Red Ross!
Dude, when you're back, you'll be Dead Ross!
I do not care! I do not give up! I insist on finishing this game!
Alright, if you insist, at least let me help you.
No, god no! This is no place for a woman. These people will grab everything.
No, I do not say that. I can only know a few things that could help you hurt you.
I like it.
Yes? Listen, Devon has a weak ankle.
Huh?
A quick kick and he will retire.
All right, bad ankle, understood!
And this big guy with the beard, he has a hip trick.
Yes.
And uh, and David over there, I heard he was not wearing a cup.
Yes? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! OK!
And Liam, Liam has bad knees. You hit him properly and he will sink like a lamp.
But - but Liam is in my team.
I do not care! You just get it!
I will take him! Okay, I'll go back in!
The red horse! OK.

Oh! Oh by the way?
Uh-hmm.
James Brolin?
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered that he was gay.
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?!

Hello?
Hello, is Ross there?
Uh, no, he is not. Can I receive a message?
Yes, this Russell, Ross' divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I have not heard from him, I've accepted that he has decided to try the marriage.
Ross got married again-nooooooo !!!!!!!!!

Oh oh! Okay, she kicks!
Oh! It grows in you.
Wow !!
Oh!
Wow, that was a big one.
I think that's the youngest girl who ever rejected me.
Oh hey guys!
Sure, I can hang out until I have to meet you. What uh ... why do not you go?
I have a job interview that I have to prepare for.
I thought you already have a job.
And people say you are not careful.
No, that's a much better job.
It is vice president of a company that performs data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Impressive! How do you know how to do that!
I do that now.
Hey Joey, come taste that.
What is it?
Do you remember the guy who gave me a bad rating? Well, I'll return the favor!
You cooked it?
No.
He's teaching a food criticism class at New School, so before we go to the movies, I want to drop by and get him to try my bouillabaisse again.
Oh, I can not wait to read the front page of the post tomorrow!
"Restaurant critic admits: I was wrong at Monica."
The cover? You really live in your own little world, right?

So, did you find someone who has already married you?
No, but Geil called for Monica Minister, wanted to know if we're still together.
We will never find anyone.
Good, then let me do it!
Joe
No no no!
Look, I thought about it.
I'm an actor, right?
So I will not be nervous about people talking.
Joey, it's really cute
No no no no!
I will not spit, and I will not stare at Monica's breasts!
You know?
Everyone knows, I'm an ass man!
This is true.
Yes and most importantly, there is no such thing as a stranger who barely knows you.
I will be!
And I swear, I'll do a really good job.
Besides, you know, I love you and - and that would mean a lot to me.
You know, we did not find anyone.
It could be a bit cool.
So can I do it?
Ah-ha! Too cocky!

I still can not believe they took my key. You trust me yours.
Of course I do that! And I'll give it back to you once you're done with it.
What the hell is that?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
You said that here was a gas leak.
Why do not you use your key?
Because if I find it in this case, the whole place could have exploded.
If this happens in another building that I look after, people will start to ask questions.
Come on!
Hurry up.
Oh! We could have done that.

Luckily, the guy she's arranged with can not hear what you're talking about.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Um, and maybe I'm wrong!
But I know that I will go out with him again, I will find out more.
You think that guy is meant for someone else and you're still dating him?
Well, he may not be my soulmate, but a girl has to eat.

(go up with that
God Ross, what's that?
Oh, but it made her so happy.
Little girl misses her cat.
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
Okay, you know what, I have to go out to eat with my son, I can trust you, if you see Phoebe, you'll tell her.
Yes.
Many Thanks.
I
He is right, right?
You know, I think that might be one of the reasons he's wrong.
You think?
Oh no, he's right.

Seven hundred dollars!
Alright, you did it! Do we have fruit?
Man, hell of two weeks, right? You know what? I really feel that I have learned something.
"Really?" So you stay with this "it's all for her" thing?
What are you crazy about? If a blind person gets his sight back, is he going around like that?

Oh.
You know, these are delicacies in India.
Me too.
Although this city is my home, so.
That's stupid, what I said. Do not tell him that I said that.
Um, you invent something.
Nice, thanks.
This is me.
Here.
Your eyes are very pretty.
Many Thanks! Oh! Many Thanks!
He would like to kiss you.
Okay, you know, you do not have to do that now.
No no no no!!
Not him, not you!
Well, the moment is over.
Oh.
Oy!

Hello! Wait a minute, hold a second. Do you think these pearls are beautiful?
I would really prefer a mountain bike.
Janices birthday is coming, I want to bring her something special. Come in here with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
Do you want to get her something special, get her flowers, pick up sweets, get chewing gum, love girls gum?
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba Bubba birthday'. I would like to take something serious.
Oh, you want something serious.
You know, what you should do, you should give her one of those barium enemas.
These are deadly serious.
Well. Listen, I'll go in here and you'll never buy anything from me.
No, no, you can not, you can not, okay, you can not, you can not buy your pearls, you just can not, you can not, you can not.
Why not?!
Oh God. Uh, okay, here's that thing, that's the thing, okay, that thing is ...
What is this thing?
OK. I went to the showroom of 'Mattress King' and saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?
They were in his office.
Well, she would not do that, she's with, she's with me.
Well!!

I tell you, it's like learning to watch Bambi while running.
You're drunk! Mom and Dad will maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Exactly there! Can we get some of it here, please? Here we go.
Hello! Are these crab cakes? Did not I tell you to come straight to me when more crab cakes are done?
How do you feel?
you are
I really wish you would not do it.
Now you just have to come through a bit more, okay?
Then we can put you to bed, okay?
Just smile and do not talk to you
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday boy! Huh?
Pheebs !!
Do not you see? Everyone is looking at me! The plan works! I did not even have to take off my top!
Speech! Come Monica!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
Hey Chandler, you can not keep your fingers off her for a second!
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
Well, you have to, because maybe it's stupid.
Well, just as Monica and I danced to them, it was the first time I knew you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Damn it!

Well.
The super could not figure out what it did.
A $ 200 per hour electrician could not figure out what it was doing.
I had seven pretty serious shocks.
I officially give up.
Thank God.
I assume Joey was right, it does not matter.
See? I do it. I totally do it. I lost it.

Are there any conscious men in the city for both of you?
He has nobody.
Yes, we - we somehow feel responsible.
I can not believe you said Woowoo. I do not even say woowoo.
Oh, she is coming! She comes up!
People, when we come back, we'll talk about their new book, Euphoria Unbound: the ever-interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
You could put the kids to bed for this one.
You know, we do not have to see that.
No way, forget it.
Come on, she is your mother!
Exactly.
Chandler, I have to tell you, I love your mother's books!
I love her books!
I can not get on the plane without an airplane!
I mean, that's so cool!
Well, well, you would not find it cool when you're eleven years old and all your friends are running around 'Mistress Bitch'.
Come on, Chandler, I love your mother. I think it's an explosion.
Many Thanks.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
AWW thanks. Uh Rach?
Yes?
Why does my Cinamon Stick have an eraser?
Oh! That's why. I am sorry!

Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me?
Yes?
You can not put your cigarette on a tree!
Yes, I can, it worked really well.
No, but you should not! Do not ever do that again.
I will not! Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
What?!
Yes, you are so broken. Book it.
Who are you talking to?
Save it red! If you do not want to spend the night in Slammer, apologize to the tree.
I am
They apologize now to the tree or I call for backup. Backup! Backup !!
I am sorry! We are sorry.
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!

Shh! Get me out of here.
Oh.
Horse!
What?
Come here, look at this!
What? Is it the comet?
No! No no. Look, here's a bug in the tar.
Joey come - I can not believe it - I'm bringing you here to see the comet Bapstein-King, one of nature's most spectacular phenomena, and all you care about are bugs in the tar and - and a woman!
Do you know, there is
Show me where?
Right up here.
Joey, where's the pipe that keeps the door open?
I dont know! Yes I do.
Joey!
What?! Alright - Hey! Do not look at me! You're the one who came up and wanted to look for something stupid
It's called the Comet Bapstein-King, okay? Hello! Hello! Bapstein was a very respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!

Impressive! This place is incredible! Sting's feather he gave Phoebe. Come on! Secret passage!
Hello!
Hello!
I am Trudie.
Uh-huh.
You have to be Ben's mother.
Why else should I be here?
Sit down.
Yes.
Oh Rach, that's great. That's great.

Hi .. how was the game?
Well..
WE WON!! Many Thanks! Yes!
Fantastic! I have a question: How is this possible?
Alan.
He was incredible.
It was like the Bugs Bunny cartoon in which Bugs plays all positions, right, but instead of bugs it was first Base-Alan, second-base Alan, third base -...
I mean, it was like he made us a team.
Yeah, we showed some softball stuff to these hassid jewelers.
Can I ask you a question? Do you ever think that maybe Alan is ... sometimes ..
What?
.. I do not know, a bit too Alan?
Well, no. This is not possible. You can never be to Alan.
Yes, it is his, er, innate Alan-Ness, the - that - that we worship.
Personally, I could have a gallon of Alan.

Well, I had a great time! I learned how to bake, ate good food, that's the first A I've got since the seventh grade,
Oh look! Acting for beginners! Do you want to feel good?
What the hell!
OK.
Okay, let's start with some basics. Can someone tell me what the difference is between up and down days?
Yes, that was a stupid idea.

My God!
These pants are burning!
Oh come on, she wants to cuddle now!
What is she trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano in here!
Are you Hot?
Okay, it just has to be me.
That was just the pants on the couch. Hmm, hmm, does it bother you when I use your bathroom?
You drive me crazy!
Okay, I stop.
Do not stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could do this shot!
Well, you are shit! But at least now the game of a man sucks you.
Wanna play?
Chandler, I can not play games, Ross will be home soon.
And I have to write five full pages if I stick to his schedule.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he comes home.
Well! But listen, what do you say, we'll make it a little better?
I am fascinated.
All right, all we need is a bit lighter fluid.
Okay, but watch out, okay, because I want to get our bail back.
Yes, I think we said goodbye when we invented hammerheads.
Do you remember which part of the wall does not fill?
Uh, right here.

Hey, revenge. How about your friends? OK! How do you want a Tiki Death Punch?
What's this?
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
I am sure they will be here soon.
Yes, honey, they would not miss that.
Relax. You are only nine inches. And the baby is at the zero station.
You really scare me.
Someone wants to help me and try to break my heart. Uh, that's great. Has anyone seen a nipple?
All right, ten centimeters, here we are.
Alright, honey, time to push.
But they are not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can not tell the baby to wait for her.
Oh God.

Here we go. Mona, um, I think it's time for us - we talked - about where things are with us.
Yes, I - I think I suggested that.
Aw, we - we are so so um, now, I - I - I like you and me - I love you, you know how I hang out with you.
And I mean - I have a lot of fun.
OK.
I mean, it does not make sense to spend time with someone, if - if it's just fun.
It has to be, it has to go somewhere, right?
So where? Where are we going?
Ah!
That's the real question.
And - and the answer is that it's fun somewhere.
Now I know what you're thinking, fun was fine with you like ten years ago, you know, but you'll - you're not getting any younger.
No, I mean - no, not you, not you, you - you
I'm sorry, um, so where are we?
You know what?
I'll bring you to dinner tonight.
I found this place that makes the best mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers.
No?
"Really?"
They taste so good.

Drum roll.
OK. OK. Well. Help! Am I a character or a John?
No, you're not big enough to be a mark, but you could be a good Barney.
Alright, I'm serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 am I go down to the court.
You really do that?
Hey, look, that name has held me back all my life.
Okay, that's probably why kids in school take care of me and why I never get on well with women. So I'll be either Mark Johnson or John Markson at four in the morning.
You have problems because of you!
Not your name!
All right, that has to stop!
Chandler is a great name!
In fact - yes, I'm sorry.
I know you really wanted me to call the baby Joey, but anyway, well, I-I'm, I'll, I'll call the baby Chandler.
Damn it! I thought that was damn romantic!
It was.

Listen, I've just seen my best friends smeared across the screen, I will not be, not me.
Impressive! That was good. That was ... tweezers?
No.
Whoa. That was very good.
Thanks, any suggestions?

Hello!
You - you had sex with Ursula?!
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she went in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
You did not notice that she wore other clothes?!
Well, I was so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Pooh! You know what? That's too funny.
No, no, it is not!
I do not want to lose you!
It's like I said to Ursula when I slept with her and I thought she was you. Yes, it's too funny.
So I think that's it.
Yes. Maybe it's the best. You smell just like her.
Yes you also.

Hello!
Hello.
So, did shopping make you better about Ross?
Manhattan does not have enough shops.
Well,
You can?
Yes. I just need some photos of Ross.
Um-hmm.
And a little piece of chocolate.
OK.
Okay, we have to talk. I have just come out of a very serious relationship
I know! And I just came out of a marriage, I mean, I should talk about it.
Law! I just think that this happens too soon.
Oh, too early, too dirty. Be honest, darling, I will not let you get away this time.
I hear you. But! Unfortunately, my company transfers me overseas!
Oh no! Where? To Paris?
No! No! Not, Paris.
To London? No, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-Ooh, Barcelona?
Okay, could you stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm going to Yemen!
When?
I do not know exactly.
Uh, well, I'll just have to absorb every Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I know it's tomorrow time.

Ooh, that's it! Oh, he is! That's him!
Great! Go get him.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
He is not really my type.
No, not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see how he is. People tell doctors everything.
But you said he was that great guy!
But lately, all the guys I meet seem to be really nice at first sight, then they turn out to be the biggest idiots.
They attract some stinkers.

Chandler.
Mrs. Tedlock. You look pretty today. And may I say, that's one
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to come by his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen.
When it comes to these prank memos, I have nothing to do with them.
Really.
Nothing at all.
Really.
Nothing.

Do you know if we contract, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course! Joey would not let you have it?
No. When it comes to sweets, he is surprisingly strict.
Hey, did you find a way to tell him you're moving out?
No, no, I'll keep trying, you know?
I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish, "go to the bathroom."
He might think I'm sick.
You know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I just have to get it over with!
You know, the next time we see them, we'll tell them.
OK?
That's it.
Oh, so will that work now? You just hang around all the time?
Pretty much.
Well.
Hey Monica!
Hello!
Hey man, are you feeling better?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh dear God! You're pregnant!
Yeah, if you marry in Vegas, you're just married in Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you marry in Vegas, you're married everywhere.
Really?!
Yes!
Oh my God! Well

Do you see the guy? He's in classics now, but you know, as soon as we leave, he goes straight to porn.
He will go to the counter
Yes.
I missed that.
Me too.
So, do you want a hamburger or something?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, you know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We will.
Okay, Rachel, you want to put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
No, Monday,
Each year.

And
Hello! Horse!
Die Hard
Yes. Hey, what do you say, we make it a dual function?
What did you rent?
Die slowly 2
Joey, that's it
Oh, well, we'll see it a second time and it is
Joey, we
And?
And it will be cool to see it again! Yes!
Die Hard
Dude, did not you say that
Yes, I have uh right now, have plans.
Well, John McClane had plans!
No, you see, the thing is, I want to get out of here before Joey gets upset and calls all the bitch.
What are you talking about? Female dog.

I know you deliberately botched this operation.
I can not prove it yet, but if I do, you'll go to jail for murder.
I do not care if you are my brother.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your work on the broken balance in the Devonian era would have been top notch!
Stop going through my things!
Hello!
Hello!
I just wanted to let you know that I've changed my mind: I'll do it, I'll kiss Joey.
No, you can not! Friends who band together are a bad idea.
Please, what about you and Chandler?
That is different! I was drunk and stupid!
So, hello!
What about all the guys you have the phone numbers from? Why do not you kiss one of them?
I could, I could, but I do not want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Alright . I think it's a big mistake, but it's your decision.
I do it.
And I can not stop you.
No.
Hey Rach, did you see Charlie anywhere?
I'm smarter than that

Oh, hey, Gunther, look at this.
Yes, that - that Chandler breaks me.
Hey Ross, listen, you want to drink something because I'm up there.
Uh, yes, I'll take a coffee. Thanks man.
For sure. Coffee? Because I'm going up there.
No.
No thanks.
You need something because I'm up there.
I would love an ice water.
You have it.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just be friendly.
Joey, sweetheart, I do not think you should go back there.
No, it's okay. Right, Günther?
Do not show me. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I do not see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
Joey, are you working here?
No.
Hey, waiter.
Yes?

You have reached Monica and Chandler, if you hear this news we will probably screen. Yes, we are.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase Museum.
I'm calling for Monica Geller.
I would like to let her know that there was a cancellation, and if she is still interested in having Bing-Geller's wedding in our facility, she is available
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom - no! Not the groom !!

Many Thanks.
Many Thanks.
I can not believe that! This is like the worst night ever!
You know, Monica, you had a small setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big thing! It's just Chandler. I am
That's crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid fight. I do not even want to see Richard anymore.
So go and fix it!
Go and find Chandler!
He is probably in your room!
Tell him that you are sorry and that you love him.
You know what? You are right Phoebe. You're right. Many Thanks!
For sure! Yes! Las Vegas, number one!
Has anyone lost that?
Come out. Put your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothing! Pay the front line!
Hmm.

Do you remember where the duck food is?
Yes, it is in the apartment of the boys under the sink. Why?
Because I'm going to London.
What?! What do you mean by going to London?
Yes, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
Well darling, take care, you do not have these babies until I come back.
I-Rachel, you can not go! Ross loves Emily!
Yes, I know, I know, I know he does it.
But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
That's why you do not go!
You go because you hope he will say, "Yes, I love you too, Rach.
Forget the British Chippy. "
Ohh - do you think he will?!
No!
Because he is in love with the British chippy!
Look, Rachel, if you go, you'll just mess around with his head and ruin his wedding!
You know, it's too late!
You missed your chance!
I'm sorry, I know, it has to be really tough, it's over.
You know what? No. It's not over yet until someone says, "Yes."
I do! I do! I do! I do! Oh, I can really haunt you. I carry a litter.

So are they all here?
I arrived here myself a bit early.
Let us begin.
Now the hydrosaurides were excavated at two main sites.
Here.
Here.
Now to the hydrosaurians

Well, anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is that I should have considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
I have ah, I recently learned what it's like to be on your side, and I'm sorry.
Do you think you can forgive me?
Great.
Many Thanks.
Okay bye.
Hello Jennifer?
Oh hello, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?
Oh, she is not home, right?
Well, actually I have to talk to you too.

Hello!
Hello.
Are you all right?
Uhh ... I think I just got engaged.
Oh dear God! He did it?
Well ... did you know that he would ask me?
Are you kidding?
I'm like the one who persuaded him to do it.
I like to see myself as the puppeteer of the group.
And you really think that's a good idea?
I just talked him into it, do not tell me I have to do it too. The puppeteer gets tired people.
I just do not know! It just does not feel right.
Why?! You two are so destined to be together, everyone thinks.
Really?! Even Ross?
Especially Ross!
Oh, uh, hey Pheebs. You know what? I will come back later.
Impressive! Something like a full house here. I only guess ... I'll come back.
There he goes, your fiancee.
I guess so.
Although he plays with himself while sleeping.
I can not say that I am surprised.

Oh, that's so unlucky.
What?
Cute naked guy is really starting to gain weight.
Okay, I'll be back in a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You have left no traces of lipstick on the phone.
Oh, it must have been you. Bye.
Bye! That's why I moved out.
Hey, you know, while we're at it, when are you going to tell my sister you do not live here anymore?
I think on some levels she already knows.
Night Monday night Julio.
Adios.
Look, Julio, somebody left his book here.
Oh, that's mine.
Oh yes, what are you reading?
Flowers of evil, from Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Did I read it? No, do you enjoy it?
I thought I would, but the translation is not good.
You are a poet and you do not know it.
Actually, I am, I am a poet.
Oh, then you know it. So what are you writing for?
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a laughing child or that lip.
Mine? Exactly here?
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
How would that work? Well, it did not rhyme, but I liked it.

Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
I bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see her, I win.
What?
We are at my stop. But do you want to drink coffee?
Are we really in Montreal ?!
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Coffee sounds great. Wait, so you live in Montreal?
Oh no. But it's only a two-hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

Okay, this is Batch 22.
Oh, maybe they taste a bit like your grandmother's.
This has a little orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Let us try it.
OK. Man, I have
Oh, what was that for? Like a cake sale?
No, just a Friday night.
Would she?
Would she? You ate my chocolate bar!

Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know, honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I want to stop, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think, why should such a person stay in such a humiliating job just because it's remotely related to the area they're interested in.
Man, I do not know Rach. Order !! I have a Yentelsuppe, a James Beans and a Howdy, who holds the Dowdy!
Oh sweetheart, come on, I'm sorry, I do not have ....
I do not mind paying my fees, you know, how much will I learn about fashion when I go to the toilet for Mira, the arthritic dressmaker?
Hello! Is my misery amusing you?
I'm sorry, I'm wa, I'm wa, I was just ah ....
It's not funny, that's actually my job.
Oh, believe me, I-II-I was there. I had to sort mannequin heads at this mannequins plus.
Alright, then I'll just talk to my friend again.
And you can enjoy your little hamburger again.
Ah, just another thing.
Yes?!
I ah, I work at
Do you want my cucumber?

Do you think they have the daily news of yesterday?
Why?
I just want to check my horoscope to see if it was right.
Oh dear God.
Phoebe.
Do not look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into depression.
From where? Ooh, come to Mom.
He comes. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
We should do something. Pipes.
We will not whistle.
Come on, do it.
No!
Do it!
No!
Do it, do it!
Woo-woo!
I can not believe you did that!

Hello! Um, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the head chef of Alessandro.
Still?
I think the things you said about me are really unfair, and I want you to give my bouillabaisse a new lease on life.
I see no reason why I would do this again.
Either eat it or be in it.
Spoon? So what do you think?
I am torn between my integrity and my desire to avoid being hit. But I have to be honest, your soap is miserable.
Thatamädchen! Huh? We should get out of here; Here comes a new class.
Welcome to the introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a béarnaise sauce?
I can.
OK. Go on.
Well, um, both have a yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel and especially tarragon.
That's very good, what's your name?
Monica.
Monica, you go to the class leader.
OK.

And there is a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seen.
But I am told that you can buy a human spleen for fifty pesos.
Humaan spleen.
Olè!
What are you doing here!
Well, you said you had customers on the street, so I'm here to talk!
Great!
Yes!
It was really great, you know, some of these people have to see me play before, because they ask for a bunch of my songs!
Yes, "you're shit" and "shut up and go home".
Listen to Phoebe ...
Yes.
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but ...
But what?
This is a kind of classic place.
Ok, do not say anything anymore.

I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we ... we can not do anything.
Well, I brought a few books with me. We could read.
Hey, it has not come to that yet.
Hey Hey Hey! Never mind if I do it!
I'm sorry, sir, these are the pharmaceutical congresses
Hey Rach, are you in the mood for a convention?
We can not. We are not pharmacists!
I know we are not, but Frank Medeio and ... Eva Trorro ... womba ...
Kate Miller?
Kate Miller is.
And ... that's the most sex I'll have this weekend.
In that case, should I make sure it's really good?
Many Thanks.

Oh dear God!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
This year should be great!
But it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that do not even fit!
No, you are not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, hey, look. Look, Ross, Ben has drawn a picture of you! Huh? You are - you are a cowboy!
Oh, that's because of the leather pants.
See? Ben does not think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! That is something.
Yes!
That's really something; that is really cool.
Greet you partner!
Maybe I should get another couple!
Ooh, you know, they - they had some with fringes on the sides.
I will kiss Ben good night.
I can not believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.
Okay, now that everything is wrapped up here, I think I'll wash my clothes.
Oh yeah, me too. Do you know if this shirt is dirty? Yes.
No you have not. You said you would do it, but you never did!
Oh yeah!

Great nap.
It was really.
Uh me? Cheerfully? No! No, but I have some close friends who are.
Let's talk about women. I am sure that our female readers will be interested in your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, as I do, I see a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how are you?"
Oh please!
Hello how are you'?

Hey Mikey
Hey P
What do you do?
Set rat traps.
To kill Bob ??
No, no, to test his neck strength.
No, Mike, I do not want to kill him!
I thought we would just catch him and, and you know, free him on the land side, where he might find a friendly possum and a funny owl.
Ok, ok, I throw the traps away.
I will find Bob, I will get him.
Bob?
Bob!
Robert!
Oh wait, I think I hear him.
Oh - oh my god!
Bob had babies!
Bob is a mother!
Better think of a new name for him.
I do not know, I like Bob for a girl.
I do not know, I mean, I'm not sure ...
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Maybe it was not Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Suzie?

Hmmm, soup!
Joey, Ross will be here any minute, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies room?
Oh yes, no problem.
Many Thanks.
Hello Ben! So you want to be an actor, right? I have to tell you, it's not a picnic. There are tons of rejection.
Joey!
What? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yes, but he waited until the last minute!
So if I said yes, he'd know that I had nothing better to do than wait for an invitation to his stupid party.
I said no!"
Which sets
Great. So is the ball in his court?
Ball? There is no ball.

Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Yeah, you know, let's skip it.
What?! Why?!
Um, you - you and your sister seem to have a very special bond, and
Oh cool! The
Ok, look. I do not know, listen, I do not know what's going on, but leave us
Do you have, do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close to them?
No, no, they are not very nice people.
Okay, listen, I really like you.
OK?
I think that can go somewhere.
What if I'm close to my family, do you want to put that in our way?
Well, um, I - I do not know. See when - if you say so, you know, it does somehow
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is cold!
What?
Yes, okay, see you later.

It is over.
Oh, was it terrible?
Well, it was boring.
I did not even know what time it was until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head.
Anyway, she did not want to stay.
I called a taxi; She just left.
I've written you a letter.
Ohh! Many Thanks! I like mail.
These are just a few things that I thought about.
Some things about us, and before we even remember that we're back together, all I have to do is know what you think about this stuff.
OK. Wow, it's - it's 5:30 in the morning. Well, I should get better at this baby.
Well, I'll wait for you, just come up when you're done.
Okay, I'll be there, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
The waiter wore the grissini in his pants!
Well, you said that we were the
Alright, I'll pull that back.
But I stand by my criticism, I know food and it was not.
You are Marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hello! I am proud of this sauce, it is delicious.
Oh dear God! You own an Italian restaurant and think that tastes good ?! Where do you come from?
Lebanon.
Give me the tomatoes, I'll show you how to taste it! Come, give it to me.
How long will it take? Because I have another critic who should shout.

Okay, what happened?
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It will be your turn!
Hey Pheebs, what's up?
Nothing! It's not over!
No! No! No!
What?!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now everything is in it. Really, thanks!
Well! Everyone ready to go to the cinema?
Uh, I think I'll skip it.
"Really?"
Yes, I stay and read my book. I want to be alone right now.
Oh. Are you sure you do not want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
That's okay, Joe.
Okay, let's go to Pheebs.
Oh God!

That was amazing.
I know.
Hey, do you realize that we have changed our lives forever?
We may have just started a family.
In nine months we can be here and have our own baby.
And if not, we have to do it on a bucket.

Horse! You have to stop! OK?! You can not just look through the peephole for three hours! You will get a keen eye!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I always knew she liked him!
You know, she would say no, but here we are!
Law?
We just separated, first!
You did not just split up.
Hey, it was like three weeks!
You slept with someone for three hours after you thought you were leaving. I mean, bullets slowed down weapons!
That's Bill Clinton.
Who is he hugging?
Oh dear God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin 'Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses this program!
We use it !!
There you go !!
Oh my god, Monica is going out with a millionaire.
I will not go out with him.
Oh my god, I can not believe this is a real $ 20,000 check, oh, that's just so exciting.
Or unbelievably offensive.
Oh, sure, that too.
What?

Hey, so, do you know how I wanted to talk to you?
Oh yeah!
Well, you know how I try to work with Emily.
Well, there's one thing, okay, here we go.
I made a promise that - oh hey!
What?
Your nose is bleeding!
Oh God.
No!
Oh, not again!
This - that happened when my grandfather died.
It's ugh!
We are sorry.
Oh, okay, I'm so sorry, what - what were you - what did you want to tell me?
Umm
We are sorry. We are sorry.
Okay, I, I can not see you anymore.
Yes I know. It is ridiculous! I cant see you too.

Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hello, chip.
Hey, revenge! How are you'?
I am great! I am great. I have a great job
So, Monica already finished?
She'll be off in a second. So, Chip, how are you, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Impressive! I have not seen her since ... So, Monica ready?

That's right, I love you! And - and I'll play with you the whole time.
How can you let him talk that way with your step?
He talks to the baby.
Ohh!
OK!
Okay, because when - when he said, "I can not wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."
OK. Well, I have to go. See you later.
OK.
Oh my god, my god!
Oh, it is incredible!
Impressive!
She is kicking so much!
Oh, she is like oh oh, who is the annoying girl football player?
Mia Hamm?
Mia Hamm!
Oh, that's amazing.
Oh oh !! A hand on the leaf Joe!
Whoa-hey-oh! We are sorry!

Okay, what do you think?
Buddy!
I never saw love like this.
You really like it?
Buddy! How did you write this?
I stole Monica and changed the name.
You can not
If he goes first, he can!

Hello!
Yes!
Anyway, I - I still think we should try to fix things, you know?
Like, um, maybe we could get him to get tickets for another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow, that's a great idea! And
May I help you.
Oh.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I have this one here.
May I help you.
You know, I have to tell you, sometimes - I can not get Chandler.
You know, me and he are doing all the time without you and you are not getting messed up.
The whole time?
The whole time!

Cassie, how you - how you work on this hot dog.
I'm done.
Thank God.
I think the last time we really went out was when our parents rented the beach house together.
Oh, right.
Law.
Ooh, do you remember the time I nailed you and tickled you until you cried?
We're probably too old to do that now.
I will always remember this summer because I got all those freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And - and - and I will always remember this summer, because then I realized that we are related.
It took you so long to figure it out, right?
Well, I'm a bit slow. As our children would be.

Relax every muscle in your body.
Listen to the clumsy music.
Okay, now close your eyes and think of a happy place.
Okay, tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Well. No, no, no, no Richard thing, just put the glass down. And go out!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, okay, well, use my happy place.
Okay, I'll just, I have to ask you, that you're not moving.
Alright, I'll try it.
Okay, alright, so, in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky ....
Do you think it was a big mistake to break up with him?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, the warm breeze and the moonlight that flows through the trees.
I bet he's totally over me, I bet he's fine.
Alright, bets and bets of any kind are, I'm sure, not allowed in the happy place.
OK.
Just-just, you know, the beautiful waterfalls and the rippling fountains.
And that - the soothing sounds of the babbling brook ....
Okay, that does not work. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.

OK honey, see you later.
See you later revenge.
Goodbye Julie.
Hello.
Hello.
Hey, come on, stop it.
Hello?
What?
Can I ask you something?
Hey Rach, do you want to hear the new song that I think I'm singing this afternoon? I wrote it in the shower this morning.
OK.
Uh, Rachel, honey, could I see you for a minute?
How are you?
F.Y.I ..
I decided to pay a professional musician to play here on Sunday afternoon.
Her name is Stephanie ... something.
She should be very good.
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not like your girlfriend is bad, she's so bad, she makes me stick my finger in my brain through my eye and spin it around.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you can not do that to her.
Uh ...
Oh, no, no, no. Oh no no no no. I have to do that with her?

Ah, no.
Oh.
Are you jealous?
No, I do not know why she has to play with you, that's all.
I mean, has not she met other Stripper Mama's friends yet?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous.
All right, people who know certain things about strippers.
And you know, and um, I ...
Honey, I love you too.
Pooh. Wait wait.
What?
Huh.
Well, there is a kiss he will not forget for a few hours, you know?
Yes. Either that or you just turned it on and sent him to a stripper.

I can not believe you came back.
Do not say anything.
I do not want to talk, I do not want to think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and just love me here.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
You missed the exit!
Oh sorry.
My God, what did you think of?
Um, Barry.
Awwww !!

I - I thought you did it, I did not know you were in love!
Buddy!
And hats off to Phoebe. Pretty much a competitor. And I could say, your breasts are still showing.
God!
Well! That's it! It's over! Everyone knows!
Well, Ross does not do it.
Yes, and we would appreciate it if no one had told him yet.

Dear Mary-Angela.
Hello.
How are you.
This is the hardest letter I ever had to write.
What the hell is wrong with you?
How do you think Joey will react when he finds out that you have blown his sister away with a letter?
Well, that's the part where you tell him I moved to France. When I am actually in Cuba.
Ok, look, look, you have to do it yourself, okay, personally.
At least you know her name.
You just go to the house and ask for Mary-Angela, okay, whenever she comes to the door, you walk with her, you just let her fall.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?

Hello.
You, um, you may have been right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Umm, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
Well.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what have you?
Two and five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you have?
A four and nine.
You're joking, right?
No why?
Well, that's a full cup!
Damn it! I'm good in cups!

What? Why? Where are they?
I'm still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! I am sorry! The guy is drunk, they will not let me go until we get that.
Oh dear God! I have to find another minister.
No! No, I am the minister! Okay, look, look, get them both on the phone, I'll marry them now.
Pooh! Joey, I have to go.
Hello! Do not you set me up? I will marry you and me now! I have the Power!

Oh hey Joey! How are you?
I can not decide which way to take to Las Vegas. Hey, you traveled a lot, right?
Yes, I am already here.
Okay, which route should I take on the north route or the south route?
Ooh, if you take the northern route, there's a man in Illinois with a bee's beard.
Okay, I have to protest, I've lived all my life in Illinois and I do not know a man with a bee-beard!
On the other hand, Wisconsin could be a different story.
Great! Problem solved!
Estelle, you have to get me some work. II lost my health insurance.
Okay, first we have to do mitigation.
Why?
Well, I think, uhh, somebody out there may have insulted you in the whole city.
Bastard!

You mean when Monica and Chandler, as you know, do laundry or go shopping or - Oh!
The whole time Monica spent with the sad Linda from the camp on the phone!
Uh-huh, do it. Do it. Phoned it.
Oh!
Oh, I can not believe it!
I mean, I think it's great!
For him.
She could do better.
Hi Guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
Phoebe has just heard about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they are friends and not anymore?
No, Joey, she
Okay, now they know you know and they do not know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but you know something?
It does not matter who knows what.
Now enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
Then all the lies and secrets would finally be over!
It's a tradition, like the parade. When the parade decided it was gay, she undressed and left her entire family.

You know, your friend is getting married, it has to change things.
Do you really think that it would be different?
How could it not be?
I mean, soon they will have children and then they will just hang out with other couples who have children.
And then maybe they have to leave the city to be around
Well, things are changing.
I do not want them to move
It's going to be okay, Joe.
It is still there!
Mrs Braverman has to be outside.
She could be out of town. Maybe she will be gone for months.
Until then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We do not want her to come back to a bad cheesecake.
No, that could kill her.
Well, we do not want that.
No, so we protect her.
But we should take it.
But we should move fast.
Why?
Because I think I just heard her running around there.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Hey, Kicky. What do you do?
I'm just trying to feel good. I can not sleep in my underwear.
Well, you will do it.
I've been thinking. Do you know how I always see girls on girls ...
Are they over or big as pancakes?
Do you know what I mean, about how I always go out with all these women?
And I always thought that if the right thing to do, I would be able to be a stand-up type and go the distance, you know?
Now I look at my dad and think ...
Hey, you are not him.
You are you.
When they were all over you to go into your father's fitting shop, did you torture?
No.
No.
They have decided to go into the non-professional actor business.
That was not easy, but you did it!
And I would like to believe that when the right woman comes, you will have the courage and courage to say, "No thanks, I am married."
Do you really believe?
Yes. I really do.
Thanks, Chandler.
Get out!

Hello.
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a bit dry, have you used all your cheese?
When you say use, do you mean that you eat before cooking?
And the cream?
Cheese makes me thirsty.
OK. Let us continue.
Well.
Oh! Something smells good in Monica's train station! Oh dear God! That's absolutely amazing! Have you never done that before?
Oh no!
I do not know anything about cooking.
I had to ask someone what it means when the water makes these little bubbles.
Well, hats off to the cook.
I'm sorry, you - your mouth was full, I did not hear what you said. Um, hats off to whom now?
The chef!
Right.

Hey, Pheebs.
Hello.
How are you?
Well. Oh oh! Roger has a dinner and he wanted me to invite you.
So what's up?
Nothing, um, it's just, um ... It's Roger.
I do not know, there's just something ...
Basically we just feel that he ...
We hate this guy.
Yes. Hate him.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Okay, do not you think, maybe it's just that he's so shrewd that it drives you crazy?
... no, we hate him.
We are sorry.

Hello!
Hello!
What do you do?
I send back all the stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Yes, that was mine.
Because I thought you found a girl and she left it there.
Yes, that would have made more sense.
You know, I - I do not feel like knowing you!
All right, look, I'll just ask you this once.
And whatever you say, I'll believe you.
Were you or were you not on a cruise?
!

Oh hello! There are a few kids playing in the street, you want to go down and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a ball, maybe you can put razor blades in them and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
She said something?
She said, "If I'm not happy to marry anywhere we find in one day, then we should just postpone it."
Move it to later?
Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent at this wedding?
Do you understand my sister's tiny little brain that people have taken the time to fly thousands of miles to be here?
That is not right.
I realize that people will be disappointed. But I'm sure they'll come back if we can do it right.
I can not ask people for that? Would you ask people to do that?
Do not show your pants on me!
We have no choice!
Somewhere half so good would have been booked months ago, Ross, do not you understand that?
This is our wedding that I am talking about.
The only thing I understand is; Deferring is not an option. That's when we marry.
So, what do you say? It is now or never?
No, I say it is now.
Or?
There is no 'or' in the head. What's wrong with these pants? !!
It is not the pants.
It is you who is backwards.
And if, and if you do not understand, how important it is to me, well, maybe we should not marry!
No wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please

Hello Darling.
See you later.
What? I-I bought food, I wanted to make you dinner!
Well, ask next time! Or at least wait for my question!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase Museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I would like to let her know that there was a cancellation, and if she is still interested in having Bing-Geller's wedding in our facility, she is available
Oh please, he did not hear it! He did not hear it !!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
NOOOO !!!!!!!!

Ma! What are you doing here?
I came to give you this and that.
Ohhh! Great ring!
Yes, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Are you talking about me?
Yes, yes, all the time.
"Really?"
But um, we just call you the sperm guy as Bobo.

Would you take a look at this dump? He hated us. That's his last revenge!
Have you seen so much crap?
Actually, I think that this apartment pollutes the good name of crap
Look at this. Can I have that?
What?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop hack, sauti, sauti, sauti.
Suddenly Leon, the manager, calls me to his office.
It turns out that they have dismissed the head chef of the lunch, and guess who got the job.
If it is not you, that's a terrible story.
Luckily I am.
And they made me the purchasing manager, thank you.
Anyway, I've met Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and party.
You know, somewhere nice.
Yes, somewhere nice.
Yes!
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?

So what do you think?
I think it's the nicest table I've ever seen.
I know!
How does that work, you will balance the plates on the heads of these little boys?
Who cares, we eat at the sink! Come on let's play!
Cheer up, Ross! Result! You suck!

What's this?
Many Thanks. Just make yourself comfortable.
Caught.
This place is really that of my grandmother.
I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I would not have been able to afford such a place.
So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87-year-old woman who's scared of her video recorder.
Are you thirsty?
Oh, you bet I am!
Okay, here's your penis!

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
How was your first day?
Ohh ok.
Oh my god, what a great surprise! This is such a nice house.
Thanks, it's my mother. So that's the kitchen.

Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Great! How about you want to go down the Italian store on Bleaker Street?
Ooh, I love this place! So no.
How about Mama Lisetties?
Enh. For sure!
I wonder how long this milk has broken out.
Oh, no, this place is totally healthy!
That - this milk is mine.
I bought this today because I was thirsty for milk, you know?
Okay, let's go!
Hey buddy! Do you know Section 11-B of the Health Code, which requires all redundant materials?
But then I would have to go all the way through the drying room.
Oh, so you say you would choose comfort over health ?!
Okay, stop it!
Larry, okay, can not you just be Larry and not Larry, the health inspector?
You know, I mean it was really exciting in the beginning, but now it's like, okay, so where will we ever eat?
Well, I could give him a warning.
Many Thanks.
Everything is going on!
Go!
Go!
If you have someone to break after dinner, I know a hot dog salesman who reaches out.

No! No! Phoebe, come on! I do not want to change! Please, come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No, but at Monica you can eat biscuits over the sink!
I know. I'm so sorry.
All right, good! This looks like so much fun.
Yes.
God, what a mess.

Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost.
A little girl lent her uniform to her nineteen-year-old sister who went to the United States.
Nimitz and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Hello! How did the interview go?
Oh, I blew it. I would not even have hired myself.
Oh, come on honey, listen, you'll go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
That should not happen.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Do you know what revenge is, maybe you should just, you stay here in the cafe.
I can not!
It is too late!
Terry has already hired the girl there.
Look at her, she even has a waitress experience.
Last night she explained to all how to make napkins ... swans.
This word was swans.

What do we have there?
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred image - Wow, this guy is hairier than the chief!
You know, it's a really funny story of how that happened.
It's all right.
It's all right.
You do not have to explain it.
This is not the first bonfire we see out of control.
You are our third call today.
"Really?"
Oh, sure, Valentine's Day is our busiest night of the year.

I'm so sorry, people. I did not want to kill you.
No, you were right. I have no idea.
Thank God. Eat.
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I do not even have a 'pl'.
No, no, we did not order that ... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Waiting! Did you say "G.Stephanopoulos"?
Wait, was that one - a small Mediterranean guy with a strangely intelligent look?
Is he wearing a stunning blue suit?
And - and a power tie?
Oh God.
Are you crazy?! We have George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Uh, Pheebs? Who is George Snuffalopagus?
Big Birds friend.
I see pizza!
Oh, I want to see! Let me see! Let me see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?

Hey, do you know what a really good rainy day game is?
What?!
I mean, my naked game. Strip Poker, we should play strip poker.
No no!
What are you crazy ?!
Come on! When you go, you - you have to play, it's like a law!
Everything ready!
AWW thanks.
Okay, who is the next one ?!
No-o-o! Under no circumstance!
Oh come on? I'm bored! You've had me do this before.
OK, if that's the rule this weekend ... No!

It is wonderful! It's like the first bathroom floor ever. Whoa! Are you going in there?
What, like a number?
Hello!
Hello! Bye!
Okay, I'm done with my decisions, these are final.
Well, it's time.
Ooh, very official.
Oh yes, you know, Chandler printed it out on his computer.
And who laminated it?
That would be me.
Good, let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurley, Michelle Pfieffer and Dorothy Hammel?
Hey, it's my list.
Okay sweetheart, you know she just turns on ice.

Okay, Phoebe, this dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the
Hello! And you go in which class?
Um, I'm actually a freshman, but I understand that very often
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should have said that I need an adult doctor.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified for that
Shh!
Doogie, shh!
Does not anyone understand that I'll have babies soon?
Huh?
Go!
Go, little boy, go!
Oh cool! You made him cry!

Hey, there are people out there asking for sweets.
Well, they will just have to wait, right? I only have two hands !!
Need help?
No! You do not know the system! There will be no one who deals with the system!
Your license please.
You do not want to hear from my dream officer Pretty?
It is petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
You have a son!
I know. I know.

Uh, how could these margaritas be?
Hello, Mr. Bing.
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Many Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I need them on my desk
For sure.
No problem.
You have to give them something, you know?
Okay, now it was Gerston, Santos, and who is the mustache guy?
Petrie.
Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people will work

....Law?
Law?
I mean, it's pretty incredible, you know, I mean, they just ran away, took off without even looking back.
Do not you know, I do not need them, huh, I have you now as friends, you and Susan.
Ah, Susan will be glad.
717? Where is 717? Hey, you have more for Susan, right?
No. But it's okay, I'll just make gherkins or something similar.
Ross, thank god.
Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
I ate a mistake.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are just a penny. Let's stock up.
Listen, Ross, we do not have gas and we do not know where we are, so we can not get a tow truck.
Oh, now you want a favor?
Yes, please.
Oh, I'm sorry that your car broke Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy now with some of my real friends, but please call to let me know you're safe, okay?
Phoebe, stay tuned. Here, take my car, go and pick up your friends.
No, I will not pick her up.
Listen, we both know you'll do it because you're not an idiot.
OK?
So you can either sulk for half an hour and then pick it up, or save us both time and pout in the car.
No, Rachel does not want me ...
Listen, I-I'm sorry Rachel left you for falling in love with those Mark guys, and you're the innocent victim of all this, but do not punish your friends for what Rachel did to you ,
Yes you are right.

God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Oh, I know.
I feel like it's my fault.
Kind of? If you just kept it to yourself, it would not have happened.
Well, I keep so many things for myself, something would slip out!
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Good, I can not sit here anymore. I have to go.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Well, I have read and for your information, minks are not very nice.
Okay, I admit it!
I love this coat!
Okay, I - it's the best thing I've ever done, including Phil Huntley!
Do you remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine!

So your father came by. He is a pleasant man!
Oh no
I should go better. (She goes and sits down in the
Ross I am so sorry. OK. II promise that tomorrow I will clarify that with him personally or by email.
I do not care about your father! I'm worried about Mona! She was there and now she is totally freaked out!
Oh okay, I'll fix that. What's your e-mail address?
Rachel!
Alright, I promise. I will fix that. I swear. I-II-I-I'll talk to her.
OK!
OK.
Many Thanks!
That's it?!
You call that a fight?
Come on!
"We took a break!"
"No, we were not!"
What happened to both of you?
!

Hello, could we get two burritos please?
I'm so sorry.
But I'm not sorry because you do not have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation called Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets for the
I'm so sorry. Christmas is a busy time, sir.
Is that because of the burrito thing?
You have to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Such places always embarrass you. Everyone wants to be paid.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I will give him some money.
You have to be smooth.
Hey, I can be smooth.
Listen, we're in a bit of a hurry, so if you get us a table a little faster, I'd appreciate it.
Of course, the Lord.
OK.
I better go back to my desk.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to include that in your review.
My what?
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss needs to give a performance rating.
But you know, there is one thing that I still have to evaluate.
Are you serious?
No, I always wanted to do that. Can you help me with this?

I can blow dry it.
I can put gel on it.
It does not matter, I still come with this little, cuddly thing in the middle of my head.
It's so annoying.
Is it failing you?
You get into my Nerv.
Is there a chance you did not see that?

Hey Joey, what's up?
Sweepin '. Why? Turn you on?
No.
Huh. What if I swept a chimney?
Joey, did it
Where are you going? The pastor will not be home for hours.
Joey, where did you learn the word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
You found my book?
Yes I have!
Joey, what - what are you going to do in my bedroom ?!
Okay, look, I'm sorry, I went in to take a nap and I know I did not, but you have porn!
Hey-hey, you know what?
I do not care!
I am not ashamed of my book.
There is nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a bit of eroticism.
It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality that you'll never understand, by the way.
You have porn!

Well, I feel like a snack!
Want a shortbread? That's Scottish as you are.
Oh no thanks. I do not like it
What?!
Well, my whole family was driven out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, many bad memories.
Oh well, it sounds to me as if your family is ready to rediscover their Scottish roots.
No!
No, no, they are not.
You are still very angry!
But do you know that Chandler is also half Swede?
You know what the Swedes are famous for?
Sit down and be quiet.
Well, yes, yes, Scottish history is so much more
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding !!
How do you know ?!

Hello!
Hello!
Come in!
Thanks for coming back, um, okay, there were a lot of people who are interested in the room, but I narrowed it down and
Great!
Okay, now, before I make my final decision, I just want to make sure that our personalities are the same.
Okay, so I did a little test.
Well, I'll say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to your mind.
I can do that.
OK! Here we go. Pillow.
Fight.
Very well! OK. G.
Line?
Excellent! Okay, um, doggy.
Kitten?
Ooh, I'm sorry! No, no, so close, but goodbye!

Dad, please do not take your teeth here!
Alright, and if you want to put your feet up, why do not you sit on the ...
Monica, leave him alone
Will you hurry?
Did not you hear me before when I told you that Janine's friends are all dancers ?!
And that they will drink a lot!
?
No, I have, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well, you hit so slowly! Can not you make it faster?
Joey!
Come on!
I do not want to make mistakes, okay?
This is the only dessert and if I mess it up, everyone will be like 'Oh, do you remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?'
So why do not you just make me worry that you're doing the little thing and you're just worried about eating it, okay?
Oh I am!
Ross, if you do not tell them, I'll do it!
Okay good!
Horse! Can I talk to you for a moment?
Oh, uh, can it wait another second, Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No, can not it? OK.

You're so sweet! How did you get so cute?
Well, my grandfather was Swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you are even sweeter !!
You know, that's a popular opinion today, I have to say.
What?
The strangest thing happened in the cafe, I think Phoebe met me.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you, I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
This is not possible!
Ow!
I'm sorry, it's just that Phoebe always thought it was you, you were charming in one, in a sexless way.
Oh, you know, I can not hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think you just misunderstood it.
No, I did not get it wrong, okay? She was everywhere in me! She touched my biceps to scream out loud!
This bicep?
Well, it is not bent right now!

It is Phoebe.
Um, well, I have some bad news, can I come in?
Um, well, umm grandmother died.
No, she died today! Okay, um, we have a memorial service tomorrow.
No you have not!
Well, many people! Look, are you coming to the memorial service or not?
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.

However, his name is Allan and we have been going out for three years.
He was my first client when I became a party planner.
He was planning a party for his girlfriend.
Well.
And he was Theta Beta Pi in Syracuse.
Oh. Oh that's great!
Oh, you are one of
"Really?" How how?
Well, you know, we would repeat everything the other said, or we would jump out of the cabinets to scare each other, or swap the sugar for the salt, so they put salt on their cereal.
That's a good one.
Yes? Do you like that?
Yes, you are funny.
I'm funny?
Thank god!
Well, hey, I have a lot of it!
Um, oh here - Want a good one?
Here is a good one.
Um, you, you take a quarter, take a quarter and you blacken the edge.
Law?
And then you say to the person, I bet you can not roll that quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.
And then, when they do, they have a big black pencil line in the middle of their face.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I'm-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. OK?

Chloe? Hello..
Is it about me taking your watch?
You took my watch?
I'm sorry, I do.
Only you keep it, do you hear, have you told any of us?
Oh no. I do not think anyone cares, you know.
Oh, another thing. Hoshi thinks you could have influenced my concentration.
Yes. That - that was the problem.

Sorry, Doug? Hey there sports fan !!
Bing! Do you have these numbers for me?
So you're still in contact with someone from high school?
Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and um, I think that's it. How are you?
Oh yes, I'm still staying with Simmons and Zana, you know?
I see Spindler very much.
Devane, Kelly, and I meet Goldie from time to time.
Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
That's all?
Ehh, you know, after high school, you just lose the touch. Oh yeah! I met Richard Dorfman.
Oh, how is he?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Is not he an architect now?
Yes, they still wear underwear.

So the Porsche guy took his car back.
But you have found the keys to his clothes?
No, I uh, I just loved the way it feels when everyone thinks I have a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you wear the clothes?
Really?!
Oh yeah! Yes, you - you came across Richard! You took a bite! It's not a big deal.
Great!
Okay, London 1

Hey, Mon, I just did the dishes!
Hello!
Oh! You're the one. Hello.
And me?! You - you just said I could!
I will not even marry! Okay, that's a question for science fiction writers!
I can not believe you will not catch me.
Hey, how can it be?
I am not even i am not even
Well, you know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Yes! Shame on you, man.

Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You are the leading man here! Let's go to work.
Um, slight change of plans. We have closed.
What ?! Why?!
It's a money thing, we have none.
You're joking, right?
No.
What?!
It - it's probably only temporary. We hope to get more money soon, so you could just hang out.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
I dont know.
One week?
Maybe two?
The money will turn up!
People will always want to invest in movies!
Hey, you're not rich, right?
No!
Uh, worth a try. Look, Joey, let me know where you live, okay?
Hey buddy, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yes.
These were left for you.
Many Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.

Rachel, do you still have muffins?
Yes, I forget some.
Oh, you're busy, that's fine, I'll get it. Does anyone else want one?
Hello.
Hello!
How was Joan?
I broke up with her.
Do not tell me about the big nostrils?
They were huge. When they sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not that huge.
I tell you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
How many perfectly beautiful women will you overlook the most superficial, insignificant things?
Hold it, hold it.
I have to stand on the side with Chandler.
When I first moved to the city, I went out with this girl a couple of times, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
It drove me crazy.
You or I?
I understand it. Uh, Joey, women do not have Adam's apples.
You're kidding me, right?
Yes.
That was good. For a second, there, I was like, "whoa."

Oh my god, he lost it. He is totally lost.
What?
Or! Or we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
You are a genius!
Aww, man, now we will not be bank friends!
Now there are two reasons.
Hello.
Hello!
Ohh, people, remember that sweet customer that I told you about? I bit him.
From where?!
On the touchy.
And
No, I know!
I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just want to reject my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, the next time you massage him, try to distract yourself.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Something like that, when I'm doing something exciting and I do not want to
Thanks, Joey.
No thanks.

Hey Estelle, listen
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back, right? you
What are you talking about? I never left you! You have always been my agent!
Really?!
Yes!
Well, no harm, no foul.
Okay, are you free this evening?
Yes!!
This evening? You - you did not say it would be at night.

Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Yes, we were just looking around.
Oh-oh, you are - you are a scholar.
What exactly were you looking for, hmm?
Maybe, maybe thoughts of Dr. Chester floor over the Smiledon californicus?
Uhh.
Ah, Ah, get out of here! Uh, meet someone? Or - or are you just here to refresh Marion's views on evolution?
Uh, actually, I find Marion's views way too progressive.
I find Marion's views far too advanced.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm a professor here, Ross Geller.
Ross Geller, why do I know this name? It's uh - wait! Did you write that?
Yes! You are the person who checked my book ?!
You know, you do not look like I thought. You are you are so young.
Well, I uh, I skipped the class.

You had no right to tell me that you ever have feelings for me.
What?
Julie was good for me before I found out about you.
Hey, I was great before I heard about you. Do you think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
The point is me ...
I do not need that now, OK.
It's too late, I'm with someone else, I'm happy.
This ship has sailed.
All right, you go ahead and you do, all right, Ross.
Fine.
Because I do not need your stupid ship.
Well.
Well.

Oh, it's so romantic to send people on their honeymoon.
You know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel have a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Everything in my time, my love.
All in good time.
Oh, shoot!
I left my guitar in her apartment.
Well, you can let me in later.
I have no key, they took mine to give you.
What?! They took mine to give you!
Why should they take our keys?
Impressive! It looks like we have a lot of goodies.
Oh, we did it, but my mother made us the biggest gift of all.
ON
No. She will live with us for eight weeks.
Uh, what?
Yes! She will help us to take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
What - you are not serious.
I mean she is a very nice woman, but we can not take her for eight weeks.
She will drive us crazy.
Hello Ross!
Hello Roomie!

Hello! What did you decide for the movie?
I dont know!
It's not like it's porn!
This is a serious, legitimate movie.
You know?
And nudity is really important to the story.
That's what you say about porn.
You're right. Maybe I should not even call back.
No! No, you should! Many leading actors make nude scenes! I mean, the chance to play in a movie? Come on!
Well, that's true.
And I'm only naked in a scene.
Plus it sounds really great.
My character is Catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
They run away together and get caught up in this big rainstorm.
So we go into that barn and undress and hold each other tight.
It's really cute and - and tender.

Hey whats up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But you still pull together, right? Because my ad was released today.
"Wanted, female flatmate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Kind!
Yes?
I just thought, you know, having lived with you, it would be interesting to have a female roommate, you know?
Someone I can learn from, someone - someone different from me.
And what is different than me? A guy who is

Where are we going next?
This witness will not return my phone calls, so we'll see if we can surprise him when he gets home.
Sur surprise him? We are not, we will not drive anyone crazy, right?
Come on man! Listen, uh, will you squeeze the offender shoes a bit before he advocates?
It is a witness, not a culprit. And nobody talks like that!
Yes, nobody talks like that!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey, I'm more a cop than you two!
What do you think about that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I am Gary's partner!
I guess so.
May I help you. Many Thanks!
Wait, revenge! Where is the other?
Oh, what, you - do you want both?
Rachel Karen Green, where is the other earring ?!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just do not freak out, but I somehow lost it.
I know it's in the apartment, but me
Well, what should I say to Monica? She wants to wear her tonight!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
These
No no! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings ?! I'm not allowed to borrow her things!
Why not?
Because I lose their things!

Well, you are - you are sweating.
These - these are pearls of joy.
Oh, that's cute. Do not touch me.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Yes!
What's happening?
Chandler is gone again!
Oh dear God! Why are you playing hide-and-seek with someone you know has a flight risk ?!

OK. Are you ready to press again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Yes!!
Little Leslie is here!
We have one more!
Oh my god, I can not believe that I have two-two kids.
How scary is that?
Come on, little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come, little Chandler! Come on!
Good, he is coming. He comes!
Hey, where is his thing?
Chandler is a girl!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
You have to read the sonogram incorrectly.
Because they, because they thought it was a boy, but Chandler is a girl!
Chandler is a girl!
Okay, keep it up!
Am I late ?!
No, no, everything is fine. Each person has 30 fingers and 30 toes.
We have our babies?
Yes.
Oh, we have our babies.

Hey Toby!
Hey Bobby.
Actually it's Bob. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler is
Er, yes. Yes, it is right, right down there. Right there, yes. Can I ask you why?
I want to talk to this bastard, see what his problem is.
Okay Bob, listen, uhh, that's why you did not get the job up here.
Toby not.
Bob!
Toby! I will not let you take care of him. Anything you say will only upset me more with Chandler!
Ohh!
Many Thanks. Oh Joey, look at this crib! It is so sweet!
I know! I found it on the street.
Do you really mean that? It is in such a good condition.
Yes.
Impressive! Whoa Whoa, what's under the blanket?
I dont know.
It is moving.
Ew.
It is still - it has a tail! Let it out of here! Let it out of here !!
Oh! Ah! OK!

Well, I went to Kyle's last night to pick up some things, and we have to reminisce
We talked most of the night, and we realized that the reason why we got so mad at us is that there are still feelings there. So
Oh just say it Kyle!
We will try again.
What about their whining and their constant need for attention ?!
I will work on that.
Oh, right, because you're so capable of changing yourself.
You know, he hums when he pees!
I know.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We are so sorry.
That's okay, we - we do not need you. In fact, hey, I'm over it.
Yes, and you know something? I do not give a tiny rat ass.
Yes, we will go.
I'm so sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. You know, she
Oh. You know, he hums while doing other things.
Yes, we are better off without them.
And you know, even if they separate again, you should not leave him in your sad men's club!
Divorced men's club.
Potato, Potaato.

Why is this servant not back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you have the keys?
Porsche.
This is your fault!
My mistake?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine !!
Can we, can we just forget that that ever happened?
Yes, of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm so sorry.
Many Thanks.
Yes.
Well, I think I'll go pack.
OK. Oh, wait! One more thing, um, do we have to clarify the question of "us"?

Phoebe!
Yes?
Did you see Chandler ?!
No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a refusal and that we could make up for our wedding and Chandler heard!
I know!
How bad is that?
!
Good for the normal guy, it's bad, but Chandler, oh dear god!
I know! I know! And he is totally crazy and I can not find him anywhere!
What will you do?
Well, I'll never listen to you again, that's for sure!
"Do you know, can it hurt if you go and write down your name?"
Rachel said that!
Well, Rachel is not here!

Come on, come on.
Damn, damn, damn, damned.
That's all your fault.
This is supposed to be the biggest day of my life, you know?
My son is born and I should be in there instead of staying in a closet with you.
The woman I love has a baby today. I've been waiting for that as you have.
No, no no, believe me.
No one has been waiting for it as much as me, ok?
And do you know what that funny is?
When this day is over, you can go home with the baby, okay?
Where does that leave me?
You will be the father of the baby.
Everyone knows who you are.
Who am I?
There is Mother's Day, it's Father's Day, there's no ... Lesbian Lover's Day.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
That's so great.
Do you want to explain that?
I mean, well, when I grew up, you know that my dad left and my mom died and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough parents to do a whole.
And here is this little baby who has like three whole parents who care so much that they are arguing about who loves them the most.
And it was not even born.
It's just that, it's just the luckiest baby in the world.
I'm sorry, you fought.

Okay, it's a typical New York apartment. Two girls are just hanging around.
Hi, how are you Kelly?
I am fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so good!
It's my new perfume. Why do not you get closer to where you can?
Oh, you know Joey, you're sick!
That's disgusting!
I do not read that!
What?! Wait wait wait! The handsome man just wanted to enter !!

Alright, I'll give you that, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
I mean, he has the monocle, he has the cylinder ...
You know that he is gay?
I just want to make that clear: are you going to Mr. Peanut?
Danielle! Hello! Eh-everyone, that's Danielle, Danielle, all together.
Hello. Hello.
What are you doing here?
So what?
What?
What is it?
That she left you?
That she likes women?
That she left you for another woman who likes women?
A little louder, okay, I think there's a guy on the twelfth floor in a coma who did not quite hear you ...
Then what?
My first time with Carol was ...
What?
It was mine
With Carol? Oh.
In your whole life you were only with one - oh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There were a lot of things we could have done tonight!

Hello. Where are all?
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to finish - what's going on?
My marriage, I think my marriage is over, is somehow over.
Oh no! Why?
Because Carol is a lesbian. And I am not one. And apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.
Oh dear God! I do not believe it! Oh, you poor rabbit.
I'm an idiot.
I mean, I should have seen it, I mean, Carol and I would be out and she would, she would see a beautiful woman, and she would be Ross, you would look at her, and I would think, God, my wife is cool!
Oh! Hey, do you think Susan is her lover?
Well, now I do !!
I'm so sorry.
Seven years.
I mean, we've been together for seven years, she's the only woman who ever loved me, and the only woman I've ever had.
Aw, god Ross. Oh.
I will do it.
No you will not.
Look, he knows he did something terrible and I believe him, he's sorry.
But you still have to make an excuse, all right, you have to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Okay, absolutely!
Well.
You have it.
Cookie, now you can beat him!
What?!

All right, that's it, I stopped.
What? I did not say anything.
Yes, but that's not the face of a person who trusts a person.
Ok, that's the face of a person who does not trust a person.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's only a bit shorter than what we've discussed.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. So he wears it.
Julie.
What?!
Jody!
You were with Julie?
Look, when it started, I just wanted to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.
And then one thing came to another and before I knew it, we were ... shopping.
Oh. Oh dear God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It did not mean anything to me.
Yes exactly. For sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you all the time.
I'm sorry, all right.
I never wanted you to know!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
That is not true!
Oh, so you just left it here?
Did you ever realize that maybe I'm so stupid?
Okay, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her?

Hello!
Yes!
I can not say it.
Why?!
Why not?
I can not say it because he is famous.
Oh my god, who is it ?!
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
What?! Well, he never told me that!

in the
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler is worse.
Man, it has to be so cool to remember that! I have no memories from the past life.
Of course, you are not a sweetheart. You are brand new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, let's not tell that story.
Oh come on!
Oh no, I know it! I know! It's the one where Joey Monica put turkey on his head!
What?! Joey has a turkey on his head ?!
Hey, it does not sound that way.
It is

Wendy, we had an agreement! Yes, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was that?
Wendy is saved. I do not have a waitress.
Oh that's a shame. Bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Monday I wish I could, but I made plans to go around.
You know, Rachel, when you finished your wedding, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if that does not mean anything to you ... twenty dollars an hour.
Done.

The reactor will blow in three seconds, we will never make it!
You have to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I wont leave you!
Do not worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine !!
No, you are not! Not for me!
Oh dear God.
What?
I am
Yes, you are great! Okay, let's take it
No, I mean, I really took off my ass.
Yes, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh yes, you are solid. Yes, you are not me.
You know what? I think that's enough for now. Yes. I do not want to be over-tried.
Fine!
I will do it without you!
I do not need you or anyone else!
I will do it alone!
You'll see!!
You will

I can not believe Ross is gone. It's just so sad.
I did not know Ross and you were so close.
We were not, but we had a class together. He was such a great guy and he spoke so passionately about science. I have always remembered him.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
And when the sky has a door, he sure pushes his ear against it and listens attentively.
I thought of calling him and asking him so many times. I think I really missed my chance.
But you did not do it!
I'm still alive!!
Kori, I know, that's a big surprise for you.
It's a long story, but the things you just said really made my day!
I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were full of people!
You sick freak, who does that? I can not believe I had a crush on you!
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me !!

We will do a quick check.
OK.
Well, eight days late, right?
Yes.
You have to be a little uncomfortable.
Uh, just a little.
You're 80 percent wiped out, so you're on the way.
It could take a little longer.
If you are worried, there are a few ways to help things.
Do it !!
Actually, these are things you can do. Just a few home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are very effective.
Well, we are ready to try everything.
Okay, there is a herbal tea that you can drink.
OK.
What's up with Emma?
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.

Whenever you are ready.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Ok, where am I talking?
I mean, uh, well, there's a way that seems to offer some acoustic advantage, but ...
Just aim at the bump.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here it goes.
You know, I can not do that.
Uh, that's too funny.
I feel stupid.
So do not do it, it's fine. You do not have to do it just because Susan is doing it.
Hello Baby. Hello Hello.

Hello!
Oh hello. It's Mark.
Oh.
What? Is it my breath?
Ow!
Rach?
Ow! Ow!
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. OK?
Okay, I do.
OK.
I really do.
Okay, I'll get your coat and then I'll put you in a taxi.
OK. Oh wait, wait - wait, you will not come with me?
Of course I am. I just have to call.
OK.
OK?
Many Thanks. Ohhh !!!! God!
What?! I wh- what's going on?
I'm sorry, I just can not go to the hospital and look like that.

Pete Becker is now orbiting the ring. It looks like he just tries to feel it. Oh, Bruiser is just ...
Run! Let yourself go crazy, rich freak!
Oh, I can not see that.
Look at it, it wins! Pete wins!
Really?!
No-o-o !!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the screen and goes to his favorite area.
Oh! Oh!
Wait, if that's his favorite area, why is he so mean?
Well, that's ironic.
Richard did not want any children from your last two friends, and it looks like Pete can not.
Dude, you do not have to brag! We have nothing here !!

Should we tell Rachel that there is an empty private space next to her?
We could, or we can have sex in it.
Let me think about it while taking off my pants!
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you were going out with him.
Oh! Oh, I think I'll throw up a bit. What did you say?
I said no.
What?!
What? I just thought that because you are pregnant, you will not see any people.
Okay Joey, especially Kash Ford are not people. Second, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I did not tell him. I did not know if you tell people. That's back when I thought Kash would still be a people.
All right, do not tell him. Do not tell him. Should he just call me okay?
Rach, I really do not think that's great
Okay, you're going to do it! I come back to this set! I will meet more actors! I will meet them all!

Oh, here you are. I've been looking for you before. Joshua is gone so you and Emily can go free.
That's okay.
She is still there enjoying her wrong party and uh, it's too late to do anything I had planned
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, wait, wait, wait
They tell them to wait!
OK. Waiting! Waiting!
Emily.
Oh no, no! Oh no! No! No! Emily!

Hello. Call me when you're there. OK?
OK.
I know. You're the guy who does not join the craftsman.
Never mind!
No, I - I actually thought it would be unfair how everyone reacted. I mean, you had just moved in.
I
Jen.
Jen, I know, that may sound a bit like that But would you perhaps want to get a cup of coffee sometime, right?
For sure! That would be nice.
Umm?
Oh! My number is there. Call me.
I will call you.
See you later.
OK!
I forgot my newspaper.

Here we go. Okay, get ready.
What?
OK.
Ow!
Do not you go?
No thanks.
No, Rachel never pees in public toilets.
Well, they never have any papers in there. So my rule is "no tissue, no Tuschy". Well, when everyone goes.
No, you know what it does not close, because the ... buttons ... are inside.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
What's happening?
My lighter is in there!
I promise.
Although, do not feel like you can not visit.
Hey, is, is Chandler here?
No, no, he is not.
Guys, Joey just saw Janice kiss her ex-husband.
What? So, what will you do? I mean, how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I've been thinking about it and I, I think the best way would not be.
Joey, you can not keep this for yourself, if you know that, you have to tell him.
It will kill him. I mean it will, it just kills him.
Well, you could wait until I might go to the dentist

Hello!
Hello.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, oh, just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I broke up, you got the cassette, which was half the last episode of
Ah yes, but now Susan and I are in Mexico and the hostages are coming home.
Where is Ben?
He is sleeping.
Ahh. Ooh, is that an ah, is that a bad time?
Um, yes, actually Susan will be home every minute, it's an anniversary.
Oh! I thought you were getting married in January?
It is not such an anniversary.
Ah! Oh.
Sooo !! Anyway...
Where will we find a small hat?
Oh, oh, oh, I will get 'Rainy Day Bear' !!
Because he knows what to do? Oh my god, you're a genius!
Oh god, oh God, but it's sown.
Give it. Give it.
OK.
Oh!!
Oh, it's like a bloodbath in here.

You're welcome. This is your fault.
How is that my fault?
Look, Carol never threw me out of the room before you came.
Yes? Well, there are a lot of things that Carol never did before I came.
You try to be clever? A funny lady?
Do you know what your problem is? You are threatened by me.
Oh, am I threatened by you?
Yes.
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!
Come in here.
Come on.
My God, people, I do not believe you.
In this building children are born and your negative fighting sounds are not the first thing they should hear.
So stop that screaming, stop it!
Yes, Susan.
Do not let me do that again, I do not like my voice like that.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?

Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "son of a bitch?"
I did not do that! Who would have done that ?!
Son of a bitch!
Okay, ask the guy maybe.
Oh, did not I mention? Carl is a guy I've assigned to be my twin for a medical research project.
You know, sometimes the good ideas are right in front of you, right?
Okay, I know, it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. You know? The only problem is Carl's acting
The
Yes, he is the reason why I did not grow up so much
Hey, can I get a piece of cake?
Pizza!! We like pizza !! Go out!!!

Hey Monica, is there a customer who wants to complete the cook should I let him in?
Sure, I love this part!
Come here.
"Really?" At the moment, I really wanted to kiss you. In that moment.
At the moment, yes.
But only for the moment. So you want to kiss again?
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Could you wait?
No.
Neither do I.
3, 2,
Joey, you do not have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yes, okay. Except that I felt it took me a few seconds to get ready.

Wow, wow!
Yes.
Alright. Phoebe?
Okay, okay.
If I were omnipotent for one day, I would want, uh, world peace, no more hungry, good things for the rainforest ... and bigger breasts!
Yes, look ... you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for one day, I would make myself omnipotent forever.
You see, there is always a guy. "If I had a wish, I would like to have three wishes."
Hey Joey. Hello. Hey buddy.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were almighty?
I'll probably kill myself!
..Excuse me?
Hey, if Little Joey is dead, then I have no reason to live!
Joey, uh-
you

I'm so sorry.
Joey, on stage!
Can you at least stay until the end of the game?
I mean, I'm going to the airport with you, I - I want to say goodbye.
Where are you Vic?
The flight is in an hour. II have to go.
Vic! Vic!
In one minute!!
So, is that it? Winner?
Yes I think so.
Listen, I ah, I have to say goodbye, and - and I have to say it quick, because that kills me.
One thing you need to know is that I will never forget you.
But you have things to do now, and so do I.
And so I'm going to get on this spaceship and I'll go to Blargon 7 looking for alternative fuels.
But when I return in 200 years, you are gone for a long time.
But I will not have aged at all.
So tell your great-great-granddaughter she looks up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm going to meet her.
So long, Vic!

I have to say
Neeeweg! The most romantic song ever
Look, I-I think that's one Elton John wrote for, um, that guy
What song was that, Pheebs?
Hello Monica!
Hey Mon!
Hey Mon!
Oh my god, did she even sleep?
Nope.
No, it was three nights in a row.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar tills on the patio.
Oh, okay, that explains it.
I got a call at two o'clock in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, that high squeaky sound, so I thought, okay, it's like a mouse or an opossum.
But then I realized where a mouse or possum would get the money to make the call.

So, man, do you want to play with me tonight?
You know, I do not know how well I'll see how hot sex is between a guy and your girlfriend.
Yes I know but
Oh no, no, I'm here.
Hello!
Hey Mon! Do you want pancakes?
You made pancakes?
Yes! Take a plate.
OK.
No, no, stay right there. Closer.
Okay, okay, but do not worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,
Listen, we're also uh, we'll watch the game here on Saturday night, when people want to come over.
Oh yeah!

Yes, if the shooter hole was lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, heroes sandwiches.
Well, you all know that I'm a pacifist, so I'm not interested in war in any way.
But, you know what?
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.
Not you, Joey.

Oh my god.
Hello! Continue the countdown to your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough! OK? You have to stop this now.
I will! But not today. For the music for dinner, I thought we could hear the tape you gave me.
Oh, the mixed band.
The way you look tonight
You are just the sweetest.
No! You are the sweetest!

Hello!
Hello!
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
What?
I check out the restaurant with Pete.
Oh, Monica, I'm so excited for you.
Wait wait wait! Waiting!!

So, honey, um, this threesome thing, um, I mean, how - how are you going to start finding?
Ooh, actually I made a list of all the women I know who could do that!
Oh. Impressive! Huh. Boy! Well, somebody has done his homework.
Yes. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is there twice, but she is too
Oh, I know. You know, only - just talking about it somehow gets me
Oh me too.

and then we could have gone with you in the sidecar from the ceremony to the reception!
Ross, that just would not have been possible.
But putting the ring on your finger with a dove would not have been a problem?
It was really fun to be married to you tonight.
Yes! And! And it was the simplest $ 400 I've ever made.
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Yes.
This proposal in the planetarium
I know, I know, it was stupid.
Are you kidding?!
With the ones, with the lilies and - and the song and the stars!
It was really wonderful!
Did you invent that?
No, actually I thought about it when we went out.
So I imagined I would ask you to marry me.
Well, that would have been very difficult to say no.
It's a good thing I did not do it because it sounds like it was a very expensive wedding. Okay good night
Good night
Even if the sidecar has a windshield so your hair does not get mixed up?
I will think about it.
That's all I ask

You! It was bananas, cream and beef! I just can not believe you ate that so I would not feel bad!
Well, I - I did not eat mine. It is still in the bathroom.
No it is not, I ate that.
Well, we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
No, have it and I have yours too.

Okay, so we went to the beach because Phoebe learned about this lady who knew her mother and father, and I do not really know what happened to it.
And I am glad that there is no problem.
That's alright, actually I'm on the recruitment committee so there will be at least a friendly face.
Ohh! That's great!
You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with that
Really?!
No-ho-ho!
Yes.
I mean, no, no, no, do not worry, I'm sure you do not have to sleep with a guy with your qualifications to get that job.
Although, I might need something convincing.
Well, me, um
Joke! God, I feel wild today!

Oh dear God! Chandler has just left!
Yes, but maybe that's not what we think. Maybe tell Monica, I'm sorry I drank the rest of the milk.
Or maybe - he wrote her, to tell her that - that he changed his name, you know? Tell Monica, I'm sorry.
I think that means that he freaked out and left!
Do not be so negative! Good God! Is not it possible that Sorry is in there right now ?!
OK. Phoebe, I - I think Ross is right. What do we do now?
Look-okay, I'll just - I'll have to find him and bring him back!
OK?
You-you-make Monica not find out, okay?
OK.
OK
I will, I will find him.

Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Do you know nice guys?
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh, I am sorry. Thanks Chandler.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren has bought a table, so I have to go
What is the charity?
I do not know anything, neither trees nor disease - Ralph mumbles a lot.
Ralph mumbles, if you are not careful?
Yes! It is strange. But the thing is to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Hello!
What do you do later?
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
We do?
I want to see what he wants first.
OK.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You are not Elizabeth's father ?!
Come on people, I - I really want this guy to like me.
It - it would really help me if you're here to make me look good.
Of course we will help! Yes! We will be here!
Many Thanks!
We know how hard these parent / teacher conferences can be.

Oh hello! How are you?
I am fine. I have to go down to the police station and look for mug shots.
Oh.
Thank you for overhauling me.
Label?
You go?
Uh, we do not, uh, we had no chance to talk.
Uh, so where did you say you came back?
Colorado.
Oh, what are you doing well?
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
OK.
Ah, I - I should never have said what I said.
You know what?
It does not matter how I feel.
I mean, we work together, so there really could not be anything between us, and what I would like to do is go to work on Monday and - and never talk about it again, okay?
Um, I'm not.
Oh god, I knew I freaked you out.
No you have not. The only thing that freaked me out was that you say nothing can happen between us.
"Really?"
Yes, so, please do not fire me for it.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.

Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Go YESS! Do not laugh, you're a buddy!
Look, mate, that's all you need, some toothless guys banging each other with sticks.
Pass on! Pass on!
He is open!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Hey, look, we're on the TV thing!

I'm so crazy that I kept this chair for myself!
Yes me too.
Hey, how's the um, miracle chair?
Fine.
Yes? Impressive! Do you know that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Not really?
Yes! You can connect it to your TV
My chair heals.

Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study last night?
Yes! Yes I have.
Then make iceberg!
Sharp.
G
What?! I did not touch a guitar!
No, but you ask my method!
No, I do not ask, I say it is stupid! What?!
Many Thanks.
You know, none of my other students thought I was stupid.
Your other student, were you?
Yes, well, you know, you just have to try harder!
Look, maybe I have to try a real teacher!
Exactly here!
Here!
Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and
Fine! You are going to learn from your qualified teacher! But do not come to me when everyone is tired and tired to hear you play
"Best man in the whole damn city."
Oh good! Take his side!
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey has to work. Come on!
Hello!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have these back when the five pages are done! Ahh!

Hello!
Hello.
Hello. Um, I think there's something we really need to talk about.
I think we do it. Why do not we go in? Listen, I know why you're here.
They do?
Yes, and to save you from embarrassment, I think, maybe I should talk first.
OK.
OK. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That was a seesaw, right?
What?
I mean, look, that - that one night we had was fun and certainly passionate, but do not you think it's better if we just stay friends?
Serious. What?!
OK.
OK.
You know what?
If you want, we can do it again.
I mean, I would agree.
In fact, I have some time right now.
Okay, you know something? Can I, can I talk now?
Oh sure.
I'm pregnant. Horse? Horse? Okay, whenever you're ready. And by the way, you're the father - but you got it

We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there is a similar league we could join or something.
I know!
Yes! Wow, well, that - that was easy. Okay, you - you go.
OK.
OK.
Okay, you know, you know, when you're in bed, with a woman.
Hmph.
And, you know, you're wrong about her.
And you get all those magical pictures in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson or the girl at the Xerox place ....
With the navel ring? Oh, Muhawa!
I know, and suddenly your mother comes to you.
And you like 'Mama, get out of here! '
You know, of course, after that you can not possibly think of anything else, and you can not, you know, stop what you're doing.
So it's like that, it's you, you know?
You know ... you do not know!
Your mother, you tell me, you tell me about your mother, what's wrong with you?
You said...
I said '

Oh!
Look at Emma!
I just can not decide who it is more like you or Rachel?
Oh, what are you kidding? She's beautiful, it's all Rachel.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why are not you back together?
No, I know.
I know because you are not in this place.
What would be alright, unless you are total.
It's complicated, okay?
Yes that is true. Yes, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
Look, we were together.
OK?
And then apart, and then together and then apart, and now we have a baby.
It's only when - if we get together again and it did not work, I could never do that to Emma.
I mean her - she thinks everything - Oh, that's me now.
What are you bringing into the water here?
Since Rachel and I are doing really well.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to do it more, you could destroy it.
Yes exactly.
Law. Or you get everything you want since you were fifteen.

God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have
You have no
Oh Ross, you are so tense! You just have to relax, okay? Just have to relax? I just have to relax
What-what are you doing ?! Are you - Okay, that's not funny! Just stop playing around!
I'm not squatting, okay? I'm porsching around.
Oh oh.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing will happen to you, you are not in trouble.
"Really?" That is what you think?
I talked to me! I'll get you done!

Hey sweety! I've missed you today!
Oh yeah?
Yes. What do you want to do tonight?
Oh, well ... maybe we could ...
Okay, are you trying to turn me on by messing things up?
Know your audience!
We also do these fertility tests tomorrow and by then you'll need to keep your tadpoles in your tank.
We really have to do these tests?
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.
I think it's a good idea to find out if everything is alright. Just a few routine tests.
But I do not want to do it in a cup!
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you all know?
No. Did you see David?
No, no, he was not around.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We drive to Minsk.
Minsk?
Minsk. It is in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We got the scholarship. Three years, all expenses paid.
So when, when are you going?
The first of January.

You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Yes. Yes! Please come in.
Oo-oo!
Pretty great! Unless I got a little shot from the robot.
Damn these robots, they should be ours
Anyway, it was not the robot, it was the guy who controlled it.
Yes, he does not like me.
He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
Tap right over the sandwich as I reach for one!
Ohh!
Well, why do not you just let him go?
I may have, I hate to do it, but I'm the star!
You know?
There is a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat on the floor.
Excuse me.
Joey Tribbiani.
Joe! I am glad that I found you, I have an audition for you!
Impressive!
The thing is, it's kind of on the Q.T.
The actor who has the part does not know that he could be fired.
It is the main character in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. !!
Oh oh!

Oh, good god! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal!
What's wrong with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
What?
Look, we've always talked about having babies someday.
I'm not saying it has to be now, but I'm starting to think we can handle it.
Were good.
We are really good.

Oh, did you catch him ?!
Uh-huh.
W-what did he say ?!
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda." Well, obviously I could not give him my real name?
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw him running out of here!
What do you think?
He will stay here and talk to the daughter he gave up!
What did you say to him?
Well, I said, I told him that I was the enforcer of Francis will and that I would have to talk to him so I would meet him later in the cafe.

Oh, sure.
Okay, in about ten seconds you'll see him kiss me.
And in about five seconds, you'll see why.
Ross did I ever tell you about the time I traveled through Western Europe?
Okay, get ready to see a little bit!
Oh, you came to Ross!
What?!
Now I'm so happy.
What are you talking about?!
You used the Europe story!
That's the magic story you use when you want to have sex!
How do you know this story ?!
How does
I heard it from my girlfriend Irene, who heard it from a guy!
Some guy !!
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams !!

How are you, you are ready?
Mom called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair. Did you know that my ears are not my best feature?
Some days I can only think about it.
Hi, I'm sorry, I'm late, I could not orient myself.
Oh ... ok, good.
But ... um ...
I have only one question for you, uh ...
If we go, we should run or run or prance or stroll ...
Stop, stop! He talks slowly, but he could pee fast! OK let's go!!

I can not believe that! How long was that?
Well, it was Alexandra
Oh, does it have a name?
Phoebe, do not get upset!
Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!
Well, Phoebe, I thought - yes, what the hell.

Ben!
Oh that is good. Maybe he will hear you and pull you by the string.
Stop the bus! Waiting! Waiting! Waiting!
Are you sure he did not break it because it really hurts?
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And here's the puncture wound from your ring.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
We are sorry.
We are sorry!
Hello!
Hello!
I have my s back!
What we can celebrate later.
Celebrate.

Okay, Paulo, why do not you just dress, and then you're on the way, ok, bye.
Rachel, how did that happen?
I do not know, I just met him somehow last night.
From where?
In his flat. Is that juice?
Wow, wow. And the fact that you dropped him because he met Phoebe?
Oh god, I know, I'm a miserable loser.
I licked my arm, what?
It is breast milk.
So?
Phoebe, that's juice, squeezed by a person.
What's the big deal?
What have you just done?
Ok, would people stop drinking breast milk?
You will not even taste it?
No!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Not even when Carol's chest had a picture of a missing child.

Aww!
This is funny.
Hey Pheebs, could not you please put your feet on my new old sheet?
Oh sure! No!
Ohh !!
My pharmacist table !!!
What?!
Nooooo !!
Ross, where did you get that from?
I understand it
Oh my god, Phoebe,
Impressive! Oh my God, well, if they demolished our table, we have to have well over fifty-one dollars!
Oh yeah.
Well, that does not even smell like opium.
Of course not, it smells of wine that you spilled! And thank you for ruining my paper by the way.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.

How is she doing?
It is too early to say so. She is resting, which is a good sign.
How is the hair?
I will not lie to you, Ross, it does not look good.
I put a clip on the side that seems to stop the curling.
Can we see her?
Your hair looks too good, I think that would upset her. Ross, why do not you come in?
Yes.
How are you?
Of course, the packaging is equally attractive for adults and children.
Ross, you are stupid. I tried, it's not a big deal. Just try it.
That would be no.
Come on. It does not taste bad.
Yeah, it's kind of cute, kind of like, uh ...
Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
Did you try it? You tried it.
Uh huh.
Oh, you tried it.
You can always say it, but it does not stop being true.
Give me the bottle. Give me the towel.

I still do not understand why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
You know, if they knew what they were doing, they probably did not give you any real names.
Okay, maybe people will give you fake numbers, but they will not give you fake names.
Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Regina Philang.
I still do not understand it, we did not do anything wrong.
I know! Although you have told a lot of jokes.
I thought you said these jokes are funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
Well, maybe it was all your questions.
What about my questions?
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itching like crazy.
Oh, I will get it.
Impressive! Usually, I get to know a girl a bit better before I spoon her.
Relax, it's not like we split up.

Look at it! Oh! Wallpaper is a bit faded, that's fine. The carpet is a bit loose. Hardwood floors !!
Hello!
Hello.
Oh! Oh! Oh Monica! It is so beautiful.
I know!!!
So I am here, ready to play.
OK.
I brought some things for the house, so check it out. Haha.
What's this?
This is a dog, every house should have a dog.
Not one who can pee on the roof.
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
And is that in case the house sneezes?
No, no, that's the spirit for the attic.
I do not want a spirit.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you have one because the house sits in an old Indian burial ground.
Hold on, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an old Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Okay, obviously you do not know much about the US government.
Hello!
Hello.
I have to talk to you!
Sure, what's going on?

Okay, I changed in thirty seconds so you could be alone with him. You should do better.
Please, I do not want anything.
Well, if you do not, I will do it.
Would you please go?
I would!
Hey guys, guys, have you seen my new chinese cabinet ?!
Uh-huh.
Look, watch.
Ooohhhh !!
And and!
Ahhh!
Hey, my dad's house does that!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great and there's nothing better than a cool, crisp New York night.
Hmm.
Of course, I could not enjoy it because Joanna is one of them

OK. It is Emma.
Emma! See? I do not want it.
Take it.
What?
It's clearly an Emma.
Oh darling, but you love that name.
Yes, but I love you more.
Besides, you do not know anything about Bing.
So I'm crazy.
I mean Oh, hi Emma.
Yes, that's you.
You are our little Em.
Oh, what is this treasure?
What?
Oh, do you want a little cousin?
Do you want a cousin now?
!

Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I'm going, "Quack, quack!" I am happy all the time!
Nice try.
Wait wait wait!
Look, Monica
Appearance!
This is not going to work.
I bet that will work!
You're so great! I love you!
What?
Nothing! I said, I said, "You're so great," and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said that you love me! I can not believe that!
No I did not!
Of course you have!
No I did not!
You love Me!
No, I do not! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Hello Greg?
Hi, is Monica off the plane?
Listen, the number you gave me 853-5 That's their old number!
Jenny has been there since she moved!
Jenny! That's Jenny!
Hey, how would you like to get together?
Say next Saturday?
Okay, how about Sunday?
Okay, um, the week after?
The week after?
Do you know what Greg?
You know what?
We are good, interesting, funny people with

Hey Chandler! You know, the girl you went to college with - who became a movie director?
Oh, yes, Dana Keystone. She was in my movement group.
What is a movement lesson?
It's Chandler's way of doing that, as if he does not take pantomime.
Well, listen, anyway, she controls the new Al Pacino movie. You have to give me an audition!
Oh, I do not know a man. I have not spoken to her for about ten years.
I am.
Joey, what are you talking about? You are a great actor.
Do you really believe?
Ugh, how can you ever ask that question ?!

Horse! Look at this. (He is wearing an edition of
Oh, okay, I have one more!
It does not hurt either - Ooh, yes, it does!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Oh!
Oh, I kind of hoped it was.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Well. Hey, but it makes me look better, really good. Oh, and something else, the video camera? Kind!!

Yes I love you. Okay bye! Hello!
Hello!
This was Alice's mother, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here now!
Oh darling, do not worry. She will make it in time.
Yes.
I guess I'll set up the video camera to seduce Joey.
But unfortunately I could not be tempted.
Incredible! I mean, did you really keep Joey's underwear ?! Why? Why would you do that ?!
I am Monica. I am disgusting. I stand guys and keep their underpants.
Well, I think we all learned something about who is disgusting and who is not.
Eh?
Alright, now I will return to my bucket.
I only eat the skin, so that's the chicken to have.

I could not find anything with Joey - Hey-hey, oh hey!
Oh, okay, they gave you the old time.
Yes.
Well, what time does it come from?
Uh, it's from before. Like the days of yore. You know?
Yes, yes I do.
God, oh, it's just perfect!
Impressive!
I bet it also has a great story behind it.
Have they told you anything?
How do you know where it was or
Yes! I know that, that's White Plains.
White levels. Oh, it sounds like a magical place.

So you still do not think that I'm a boyfriend?
Huh?
I saw you checking me during the game last night.
I, um, shut up!
"Goodbye Phoebe and Ursula, I'll miss you P.S.Your mother lives in Montauk." You just wrote that!
Well, it's pretty much the essence. Well, except the poem. You read the poem, right?
No !!
Alright, wait!

Rachel, it will happen. Chandler will move in here.
But I
No wait!
Just let me finish, okay?
That's not something we just decided impulsively in Vegas, that's something we both really want.
And it
It is? "Really?"
Yes sweetheart.
I mean we are not, we will not live together anymore?
No.
What? Oh dear God! I will miss you so much!
I'll miss you!
I mean, it's the end of an era!
I know!

Why do all your coffee cups have numbers on the bottom?
Oh. That's right, Monica can keep track. That way, if they're missing, "Where's the number 27?"
You know what?
It did not do it.
Okay, what you had with Rachel is what I have with Alice.
Well, w-how, how is that?
It's so cool, man, it's like that, it's just because being with her is so much better than being with her.
Yes / Yes.
Why can not I find this?
Do not ask me, I had it and I blew it!
Well, I want it!
You can have it!
I do not know, maybe I can not. I mean, maybe something is wrong with me.
Oh no! No!
It's out there, man! I've seen it! I understand it!!
Then you stick to it !!
Alright, man !!
All right, congratulations, happy bastard!

Come on, Lydia, you can do it.
To press!
Push them out, push them out, harder, harder.
Push them out, push them out, away!
Let's get the ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
Let's ... I was just - yes, right.
To press!
To press!

OK.
Ross, did not you say there was a lift here?
Uh, yes, but I did not. Okay, here we are.
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Okay, you know something? It is not left, left!
Oh, okay, take it over your head!
Just over your head!
You can do it!
You can do it!
OK.
You have it?
Oh, okay, I understand.
No, wait, look. Appearance! I'm sorry, I've never had it
Howard is the
Yes, but I too, he's just, man.
Okay, well, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ugh, can you believe the guy?
Yes. I really like his glasses.

Ohh!
What?
It kicked! I think the baby has kicked!
Oh dear God!
Oh no, wait, oh no, the rubber band on my underwear was broken.
Oh dear God! I overslept! I should be on set half an hour ago! I've got to get out of here!
Oh wait, Joey, you can not go like that! They stink!
Look, I know, I sleep before I can take a shower and now I do not have time!
They are only ten blocks away, if I run, I can do it.
You come in the whole room! I am Chandler.
Hello.
Hello.
It bothers you when I do
No Please.
So what are you going to do?
I talk in my sleep.
What a coincidence, I hear in my sleep.
So why do not you give me your number?

Previously with friends.
I do not know exactly. It's like wrestling.
Oh?!
Yes, but without the costumes.
Oh.
And it's not wrong, it's totally brutal.
Yes, there are two guys in a ring, and the rules are, "They are
So you can like, bite and pull people's hair and things?
Yes, everything goes, except ah, eye joints and fish hooks.
What is fishhook?
Huh, what's fishhook ... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.

Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to avoid yelling your name.
Well, that makes me so good.
It was just so embarrassing and bumpy.
Bumpy?
Well, maybe he had a new, cool style that you're unfamiliar with.
And maybe you have to get used to it.
Well, there really was not much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?

By coming! Oh! By coming! Oh! Hello! Hello! No! Law! By coming!
Well, it's not that bad.
Yes, most of the damage is mostly in the bedrooms.
Oh!
My God!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform on Thursday?
Excuse me?
Joey! Developed! You would look
Oh, how bad is it?
Oh, it's bad. It is very bad. The only thing that is not burned is an ass. What I do
How is your room Rach?
Everything is ruined. My bed. My clothing. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Does not that belong to me?
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
So, you will not be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Impressive! Oh-okay, look, I'm
Yes, they can stay with us.
Did you find out what triggered the fire? Mr. Fireman?
There is so much pressure.
I do not mean no offense, but what you do is very different.
I do not know if you understand it.
Yes, none of us has to deal with pressure in our jobs.

Well Phoebe, we have to do something!
Well, you know?
I mean, Joey will not make it on time.
So I'll go through the hotel and see if there are any other weddings going on.
OK. Oh, but do not tell them Monica is pregnant because she frowns.
OK.
OK.

What is all this about you guys fighting ?! Is this really about a room ?! I mean, that's so silly!
Ross, we can handle it.
Well, apparently not, and I can not stand by and watch two people who interest me get hurt a lot about something that is so silly.
I mean, enough of the folly!
Well, why do not you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay, okay!
Two very good points, look, I've known you both for a long time, and I've never seen one of you, a millionth as happy as you have been since you're together.
Do you really want to throw it all away over a room?
That's so silly.
Well, what is more important, love or silliness?
Well, we love silliness, but we also have a weakness for love.
Love is the best medicine.
That's laughter.
Why are you doing this?
I dont know.
OK! Well! Now, Chandler, you - do you want to live with Monica, right?
Yes I do.
And Mon, you want to live with Chandler, right?
Yes.
Well! An oral contract is binding in the state of New York!

Oh.
But not me. I, Phoebe.
Well, I'm not surprised that they feel that way.
You are not? You see, that's why you're so great!
Actually, you know, typical behavior is when you have this dysfunctional group dynamic.
You know, that kind of co-dependent, emotionally crippled, sitting in your stupid coffeehouse with your stupid big cups that, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me !
Define me!
Love me, I need love!
".

Did you really do that before?
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
You only take a big, big swing.
Now do not hold back.
and Phoebe takes a wooden baseball bat and begins to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.
Hello!
Hey Hey Hey!
What do you do?
We're celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Oh, sure.
Yes! For sure! Yes! Oh, you know something? If I heard a shot now, I would throw my body on you.
Oh yeah? Well, maybe you and I should go for a walk around a bad neighborhood.
OK!
Well.
Bye!
Bye!
Stop it, Ross! I hate saving your life and kicking your ass the same day!

Hey, Joey, could you give the cheese?
Yes.
Listen, I'd prefer it if you do not call me Joey.
Since I do not know anyone here, I thought it would be cool to try a cool working nickname.
Hey, dragon! Here are your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
It's like - there are $ 300 in this!
Yes, people get pretty generous during the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
OK.
Can the waiters gather to hear the specials of today?
Okay, first there is a Chilean sea bass prepared with a mango relish on a bag. Why does nobody write them down?
Because we can remember her.
Because you invent all the fake specials and make me cook them the way you did last night?

Hello. When you were children and played
I was always Joanne.
Question. Was ah, egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighborhood?
Ewww! Oh! It's the mattress king!
Boo !!
Do not look good. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Waiting! Waiting! I want to see it. After I divorce him, half of this kingdom will be mine.
What a wanker!
Oh, I can not believe he uses our divorce to sell mattresses.
I know!
And Ninety-Four for a pillow-top queen set to take care of the divorce, these babies will sell themselves.
And I'm horrified by you, by the way.

You had to do it, right? You can not just leave it alone.
Four percent. OK. I type more than that when there is a mistake in my food.
Ross, tonight, it was about you two getting along. Oh, would you already see my chiropractor?
Yes, I will go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
I am, I freak out!
Monica trusted me something and she should not have!
Alright, I have not lived here for a while, so I have to ask you something.
Is Monica still switching on the light in her bedroom?
Uh. Yes.
I am
Alright, look, here's the end result Ross, that's fixable if we act fast, okay.
So I invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can do it nicely.
Look, darling, I've tried to make nice, it's not working.
Okay, listen, Ross, I realize that my dad is difficult, but that's why you have to be bigger here.
Look honey, I could be the bigger man, I could be the tallest man, I could be a big, huge man, and it would still make no difference except that I could pick your father and say "Like me!
Like me, little doctor!
Okay, can not you try it again, Ross? To me? To me?
Rachel Brunch will not solve anything. You have to deal with it, okay, we'll never get along.
Okay, you'll have it, okay.
Because I already have a mother and a dad who can not stay together in the same room, okay, I do not want to have a separate room for you!
!
Okay, okay, okay. I will get the bagels.

Okay, Joey, do you know that you have to wear underwear because you come back immediately after the audition?
Alright, then you show me that too.
Okay, something is missing. Ooh, I know! Um, okay.
"Really?" A wallet?
It is not a purse! It is a shoulder bag.
It looks like a women's wallet.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all men wear them in the spring catalog. Appearance. See, look,
See, look,
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.
No! No Joey! Unisex.
Well, I will not say no to that.

So, um, did you tell your parents?
No, but it will be OK, they are pretty cool, my brother is just like that. , ,
May I help you.
You know, I have only one more question, um, if you had figured that out before and um, I was already there, do you think I was the one who did.
,
,
No, um, I'm sorry, do not tell me, I do not think an answer would make me feel better.
I love you, Phoebe.
So, your brother is straight, huh? Serious.

Hello!
Hello.
I just came here to not drop anything. So the weekend was a shit, huh?
Yes, it did.
Well, I think that's over.
What?
Well, you know, you and me, sometime it had to end.
Why exactly?
Because of the weekend we had a fight.
Chandler, that's crazy!
If you give up every time you beat someone, you would never be with anyone any longer than - ohhh!
So, that's not over yet?
You're so sweet!
No.
No, it was a fight.
You handle it and move on!
It's nothing to get excited about.
"Really?" OK. Great!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We are in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.
OK.

Hello!
So you like the short hair better.
What? Yeti - I mean Danny?
Can I tell you a little secret?
Yes!
I want to keep one.
Oh, I will be in the news!

Oh please.
What? Honey.
Oh, I am, my page still hurts when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh god, I'm so sorry.
I know.
Au !!
Oh God!
Hey guys! Guess what?
Do you have a job on a river boat?
Do you know what I have not worn this suit for a year because you hated it? Guess what? You are not my girlfriend anymore, so ...
Oh, I see, so this suit makes sense.
Law.
Now that you're on your own, you can look as stupid as you want.
You like it right?
Oh absolutely. I like it even more than Colonel Sanders. Horse! Horse! I'm just kidding!
Yes come here!
What - what did you want to tell us?
Yes. Oh! Did you invent the cotton gin ?!
Goodbye!

Hey, I have one! I have a!
Hello!
Hello.
Oh, Uh, up or down?
Oh please, please. I - I hate being a Ball Buster, can I just do it?
Could you please push up?
For sure! I feel so bad for you; I also broke my leg once.
Oh yeah? How did it happen to you?
Well, it's a long story.
It's kind of embarrassing.
Let's just say there was a typo with a sexual guide.
What about you?
Car accident.
Oh.
Oh, let me guess that an idiot on a cell phone is not paying attention?
Yes. Me. Oh hey, that's me. Hey, I suppose you visit somebody.
Uh-huh, yes.
Well, um, if you ever know, maybe you would like to visit somebody else
Oh yeah! II want that.
I'm in the middle
Waiting! What?! No!! Elevator !! No!
Uh, you have to press the button.

Oh, we did it, and you still have all your lights.
Oh, I did not include the room tax.
Oh man, do not worry, I found the car of an unattended maid. We are far ahead of the game.
Oh dear God.
What?
There is something new in the bowl.
Look, we have enough, just go away.
No, but I want ... I want the pine cones!
There's a forest out there.
It's not the same.
Ok, go fast!
Thank you for a nice stay.
Oh, my maple candy!

Oh my god, what happened?
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He whirled me ... away ... that ... bed!
Impressive! Spinning, that sounds like fun.
Oh, I wish. No, you know, he just tried Ross' hug and roll thing.
Ross is what?
Do you know what, where is he hugging you and rolling you away and ... oh ... my .... god.

Oops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my father, that's Frank! Yes! I'm sorry that I'm getting shabby.
Take it easy - if you want, there are cookies on the counter, or, - sangria! I can do sangria!
No sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Oh.
Well, so, um, anyway, I was, I was looking for my father, and um, did you hear about him or see him?
Oh no, I - I'm sorry, I think we did not look at it after high school.
Oh ok. Well, tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Oh well. You know, we were always together, in fact we had a nickname for the three of us.
Oh what? What was it?
The three losers.
Oh, poor Lily.
Oh, you know, I - I've heard of what happened, it must have been terrible for you to lose your mother that way.
Yes, no, it was great.

Well, all right, we've already tried to feed her, to change her, to belch her, oh, try this!
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Okay, here's something, it says, to try to keep the baby close to your body and then swiftly swing it from side to side.
OK.
It worked!
Oh no, I just stopped to throw up a little.
Oh, come on, what should I do, it was hours and it does not stop crying.
Umm, she revenge, right, she.
Yes, I'm not so sure.
Oh my god, I lose my mind.
Yeah, no kidding, that just proves that nothing good can come from sex with Ross!

Well, you are not.
Oh, it's so easy for you, I mean, you're not married, you can have sex with who you want!
Yes I can! And do not think that I do not do it because I do it! I mean all the time, you bet!
Monica. You did, you did it right?
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm 30 years virgin?
Oh dear God! You are a 30 year old virgin!
Say louder, I do not think the guy heard all the way back!
It's not like that, I have no chances.
I mean, you know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
I see this guy Roger, okay?
He's not perfect, but um, I think maybe I should just get it over with.
You know, give him my flower.
Oh dear God!! Do it!! Honey, you have been waiting
You know what? You're right?!
Yes!!
I mean, sex does not have to be big!
There should not be all these rules and restrictions!
You know, people should always be able to sleep with whoever they want
Rachel! I'll never think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh, what do you know? Virgin!

Press, press!
Were here!
Where have you been?
Long story, honey.
Alright, Carol, I need you to push on. I need ... Sorry, could I have that?
Come on.
Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing that you will not hear from me.

Well, I hear you hate me!
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful with it.
A little bird has told me something about you, that you want to tear off your arm and throw it at me.
And you have a 'hatred' of it ?! You make a big leap there ...
All right, good, good, good, good, well, we have to do something about our little situation here Joey.
So, that's my idea: you and I spend some time together.
But what will that do ...
For Chandler!
Guess, I have an audition!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I am so proud.
I was wondering if you would think about training me for it?
You bet! What is the part?
Oh, it's great, it matters

Hello! Hello! Hello. Has anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you.
He - he was with me, um, we're playing a little game, you know? Hide and seek.
You can not ask us son, that's scam.
You're right, thank you for telling me honestly, daddy.
Well, he better not come over here. He can not see the bride in the wedding dress.
As far as I remember when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Honey, it's no luck.
Oh dear God! Monica!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler?
Great. He's fine. Do not worry about Chandler.
Are you alright?
Uh-huh.
Yes baby!
I'm really glad you're fine, but I'm just thinking about what would happen if - if you two were actually connected.

Well, we got along well in the strip club, right?
Oh, that was great. Thank you, the hottest cocktail waitress is there to teach the third grade!
I can not believe it! He still has not called.
Who, Josh?
It is Joshua.
What, he does not like Josh?
No, I do not.
Alright, well, I'll put my sweats on again.
Oh no!
Waiting!
Waiting!
Okay, you know, you were right, you were right.
We really were not great at being boys, but do you know why?
Because we are girls.
Phoebe, his music could not
Thank you thank you.
Yes, I lost it.
You know, I will not play anymore, or can you finish my set?
After this? Yes! No, I mean, if I can help.
Yes, as I could
What?
I intentionally played bad guys.
Okay, so you tried to play bad all the time.
Yes, no, just the last song.

Oh, I thought about having people for the game.
Oh yes, who plays?
The players.
Someone seems to miss being the hostess.
Please, it's a relief, what it is, what it is.
Alright Pheebs, stretch your plate!
Oh.

Something?
No! I talked to Joey on set, he did not hear from him. II-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
You told them he was missing?
No! I made it look like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
Who owns this?
I do not want to say it.
Oh come on! I do not care! Come on! Who owns this?
Diane Keaton.

Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why are not you dressed yet ?!
I'm sorry, but I've just written the best dance song for your wedding. Look at this.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you something, if you get ready now I'll let you play at the wedding.
Really?!
Oh, that's so exciting!
Many Thanks!
Thank you Monday!
Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again, I have to grab you a bit.
Fair enough, get ready now!
OK.
I'll get everyone else, finally we can start celebrating - I'm sorry, I seem to have opened the door to the past.

My best shoes, so good to me.
I wear it every day.
At the bottom of the heel, holes in the toes.
I do not care what people say.
The best friends of my feet, friends to the end.
I'm a hot chicky with them.
Although late one night, not much light, I ....
I approached something disgusting.
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll ... avoid the ..... Pillleeee.

God, it will be so funny when I get home and you are not here.
You know?
Not Joey and Chan anymore.
No J and C anymore.
"Do you want to go to Joey and Chandler?"
"Can not, it's not there."
Listen, I'm just on the other side of the hall, we can still do everything.
Yes, but we will not be able to get up in the middle of the night and have these long conversations about our feelings and the future.
We did not even do that.
Hello.
Hello!
Hello.
So I told Rachel that it would only be us both.
Oh yeah? Well, how did she take it?
Very well. Yes. Surprisingly good. Yes, she did not cry. She was not angry or sad.
Uh-huh.
I will not do that.

Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the fridge
Okay, okay, but Rachel will be here too, can not I just ask her?
Yes, okay, try it!
Well! Let's do this!
Woo-hoo !!
Yes, Cheerie-o!
London baby!
Hello!
Hello!
Monica? What time is it?
Uh, 9.
But it is dark.
Well, because you always sleep until noon, silly! This is 9.
I guess, then I will be washed. Watch this sunrise.
I am
I know myself too.
Hello!
Do you know what if we go away for an entire weekend?
You know, we have no breaks and we could be naked all the time.
Every weekend? That's a lot of nude.
Yes, I can say that I have a conference and you can say that you have a cooking thing.
Ohh, I always wanted to go to this culinary show that they have in Jersey!
Okay, do not you know that? Let's go.
Waiting! What about Joey?

Oh, here's a book by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What's this?
Sounds like two people really enjoy the Dewey decimal system.
I am sorry!
We are sorry!
You did not bring it

Hello!
Hello!
Oh you know, uh Kash, you liked yourself a lot lately. He said he thought you were charming.
Okay, I just have to stop by first.
To record the game? You do that every time, Ross, it's you
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Oh, you change the apartments?
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Yes, but when the baby comes, she will want to move.
She is?
Yeah, you did not expect her to live there with a baby, right?
I think I did not really think about it.
Ezel! Hey Günther! You are an Ezel!
Damn it!

Look what I have! Look what I have! Look what I have! Can you believe that they make these for little people?
Little village people.
Okay, look at that. That is my favourite.
Oh, that's so cute!
I know! Phoebe will love putting her in these!
Huh. But Phoebe will not be the one to dress her.
Because she can not keep the babies.
Oh dear God! We throw the most depressing baby shower of all time!
Wait a minute!
Unless we give her all the presents she can use after she becomes pregnant.
Same as Umm, normal coffee, tequila.
Oh, and someone can get those leather pants she always wanted!
Oh, she will love that!

Okay, you ask the court for a cancellation?
Yes, your honor, and here are forms, all filled.
On the basis of your petition you request a cancellation on the grounds that Mr Geller is mentally unstable.
Well, I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user.
What?!
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Crack is not even an intravenous drug!
Well, you would know.
Now, is it also here that you lied about your sexual preference before your marriage?
Oh come on!
Ross, please, I have found the magazines!
No!
Phoebe, just because I'm alone does not mean I want to walk naked.
I mean, you live alone, you do not go around naked.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it will take so long for me to open the door?

I know, I lied! I did not want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can not even see my own baby!
Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look, come, look, it's - it's - it's, it's right there.
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Are you really?
No, I do not see it!
Come on! Come on! Here, okay - okay, you see that? This little thing that looks like a peanut?
Yes.
Sweetie, that's it.
That's it? Well, I saw that! Ohh-oh-oh, thanks.
You're welcome.
Impressive! I can not believe this is our baby.
Yes, that's our baby.

Gin.
We played gin? You know, if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Will you stop!
OK. Well.
Okay, okay, I think you're great, I think you're cute and you're smart and I love you.
But you will always be the guy who pissed me off.

Hello!
Hello!
Let me tell you about this girl I dotted with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Hey, look at me, I'm a bitch!
So you want to do something tonight?
Oh, I can not. Dr. Roger comes back again.
Oh.
Oh, right!
Law!
Because you still see him and er, he's a good guy.
I mean, I remember a time when
Are you alright?
Yes! Total! Total and you?
Great! It is so amazing! I mean, the last time Dr. Roger came by, I was
I bet he can.
You know, I have no date, but I could certainly use a physical one. Are you sure you are okay?
Oh yeah! Yes! Do not worry about me, I'm fine!

You have the clothes clean. That's the important part now.
Oh, I guess. Except now everything looks like Jammies.
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this car.
Yes, but what if not? What if there is a reason why we can not have a baby?
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are said to have children. I'm sure everything will be fine.
oh, oh, yes, ok, thanks.
I can not believe that I did not even think about it.
I think I was just so worried that I came here and ... had to do that ...
What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can not do it in a doctor's office?
It was a "Wendy's !!"

... and then Zana, just let it break !!
Look, not that I like to talk about people I went to high school with because I do it, but um, maybe we could talk about something else?
Like you, I do not even know where you work?
Yes.
Yes. Well, I think our second fight is coming

Hello.
Hello!
So you stole my joke and you stole my money.
Well, I would put it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy cashier that I'm a published writer.
Well, she'll know you stole the joke.
Oh, what will you do, follow me down there?
Yes!
Well, I will not go now anyway.
Okay.
May I help you.
Ah, Gunther, I can not pay now because I do not work, so I had to save a few luxuries, like me, I pay for it.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I do not know.
You see, it's just, you see, I was in a soap opera on a regular basis, you know?
And to go away, I just plus, I would have to wait for all my friends.
Okay, but the money is good and you can stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Flexible working hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Can I use the phone?

I do not have a name.
Alright, how should we call you?
Okay, now, temporarily, you can call me Clint.
By no means are you cool enough to pull Clint.
Okay, so what name am I cool enough?
Um, genes.
It's Clint. It's Clint!
See you later, Gene.
Bye, Gene.
It's Clint!
What's wrong with genes?

Welcome to Las Vegas.
Many Thanks! Have a good flight?
Yes I have. Thank you, it was excellent.
Hope you had a nice flight.
Ohh, it was the best!

Oh, Larry.
Um, are health inspectors working on behalf?
No, bribes.
It's okay to laugh right?
Come on Joey !!!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!
Look, it's not such a big deal, so Monica and Chandler do it.
I can not believe you would say that!
We are sorry. Monica and Chandler love each other.
No! I mean, come on! That is a
I dont know.
Is he romantic with her?
I dont know.
Are you in love?
I dont know.
You know nothing.
Oh, I know one thing!
What?
They did it right on the couch.

Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour and many people who are less ill than my friend have gone in there.
I mean, the guy with the toe thing?
With whom does he sleep?
Oh, come on Dora, do not be angry ...
I know we both said something we did not mean, but that does not mean that we still do not love each other.
You know, I feel like I lost her ... Ba!

You see, Molly, what people do not understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
Where did you go to college?
Oh, I did not go to college.
No, where did you study acting?
Molly ... people do not study acting ...
Molly, oh, do you mind just giving us a minute?
Sure, I'm going to Emma.
Thank you.
Will the stable boy never get the princess?
What do you think you'll do, sex with her here on my couch?
No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
You know, that's not fair.
What makes you think that I will just sleep with her and then blow her out?
Huh?
Can not you go into the possibility that I really like her and maybe want something real?
Listen, the truth is, I have not felt that way since Rachel, okay?
I did not think that I could ever love again.
Come on! Joe!
OK
Hello, is Molly here?
Yes, come in. Molly?
Hello! Guys, that's Tabatha. I'll see you tomorrow then.
Okay ... well, Joey, I think we have no problem.
It's as if my favorite fairy tale comes true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!

And what's cool is the character from Naples, right?
Yes.
My whole family is from Naples!
Oh that's great! Okay, well, I've heard everything I need to hear. I just have to, Leslie
Joey, that's the awkward part.
Oh!
Hey, right!
No problem.
I understand completely.
You must know that I have no terrible scars or tattoos.
Do not worry. I have nothing to hide.
Come on, that's me.
One hundred percent natural!
I tell you, that has never happened.

This room is available.
OK!
OK wait!
You listen to me!
You listen to me!
Since I've been waiting for four women, that's four, one higher than the number of inches I've expanded, and have come and gone with their babies!
I'm the next one!
It's my turn!
It's only fair!
And if you bring a woman in and she has her baby in front of me, I'll sue you!
Not this hospital, I'll sue you!
And my husband, he is a lawyer!
Uh Rach
Go back, sweetheart!
I do not think the next patient is very far.
Okay, then bring it in.
OH MY GOD!!!

Ross Ross Ross Ross! Stay away from this guy and this guy. And this one-dude! They are all huge!
They do not look bigger than me!
Well, maybe it's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger where you are.
I'll just say hello to the boys. Well?
Well.
OK.
Hello.
Whoa! I kind of liked it.
Okay, I know what I have to do. I have to go Red Ross. You know, Red Ross!
I do not even know what you're talking about.
Come on! The time when we all stood in line
You know, you were much more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to, we'll support you like crazy.
Yes.
We just want you to think about it.
Yes, darling, maybe you can talk to someone who has a baby. Like your mother?
My mother never conceived. Oh! But my birth mother did it.

Thank you for meeting with me.
Many Thanks. Well.
Come sit down.
Sit.
Sit!
Umm, all right, before we start, I-only you have to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.

Happy sixes ....
Everyone, that's Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Hello!
And Joey ....
Hello!
And Ross.
Hello!
He does not speak much English.
Look at this!
So, um ... where did Paolo come from?
Oh ... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. In our life.
Well, the cat ... the cat was Paolo's cat!
That's funny ... ... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Alright. I looked around the whole building and I could not find the kitten anywhere.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! There you go! Finally to know again! And I suppose ... because nobody told me ... that's Paolo.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
You can bet on it!

Okay, where the hell did you get that ?!
When Mom and Dad brought you to the hospital to grab your nose, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
This mug is mine!
No it is not! You want it, you have to win it!
So, do not we eat at all?
Why?
Because I do not work on the Szechwan Dragon.
OK.
You really have to sleep, honey.
I know I do.
Hello.
Hello.
Guess what?
What?
You have published my work.
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
Rach, look! Oh hello! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to rescue me? There he is.

Oh dear God.
You know what that is, we're preparing for the prom.
Oh.
What?! You drove us out !!
I told you not to go down there!
Well, he let Rachel cry!
Rachel always cries!
That is not true!
Joey, you go down there and you suck on him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked!
Well! I'll try it! But if I can not, you can stay with Chandler and me until you settle in.
Go!!
All right, all right.
I mean, I have to talk to him first, but I think he'll be cool with it.

Well, he's just a nice guy. Do you really think that Mark does not want anything to help him?
Well, I suppose I have to take a shower with him, but you know, that's true of every job.
How do you feel?
Well, my apartment is not there anymore because I drank it.
Where did you go? We lost you after you opened all the presents.
Yes.
Yes, I ended up in the storeroom and not alone.
Woooo hoooo !!!
Au, no 'Woo-Hooing', no 'Woo-Hooing'.
Why, what happened?
Ah, I played with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
What is the worst part?
I can not remember which sister.
You see what men do! Do not tell me, men are not nice! These are men !!

What's wrong with you?
Nothing!
Well, I - I had that blinding pain in my stomach when I raised weights before, then I fainted and uh, I could not get up since then.
But I do not think it's serious.
That sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-go to the doctor!
Under no circumstance!
"Kay, if I have to go to the doctor for something, it will stick out of my stomach for this thing!
Why did I have to start training again?
Damn, you're 15s!
It is a small matter.
It has all these layers.
First there is a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then pudding, which I made from scratch.
[Joey and Ross make faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then sauteed beef with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something's wrong.]
then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just have some whipped cream on top!
It tastes like feet!
I like this.
Are you kidding?

Does anyone else believe that David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me he thinks you are a fox.
Welcome everyone, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
Oh oh! It's back on!
Guys, can not we see that well?
Shhhh!
Guys, did that ever happen to you?
You go to the fridge to get a good glass of milk, and those damn cartons are so hard to open.
Oh, you told Mike. Oh! There has to be a better way!
And there is Kevin.
Can we turn that off please?
No, Kevin.
There's a revolutionary new product that guarantees you'll never have to open milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Are you fascinated?
You are flingin 'flangin' right, I am!
Remember, he has never used this product before, you will see how easy it is.
Go straight ahead.
This works with every milk carton.
Wow, it's easy. Now I can drink milk every day.

Well, maybe you want to tell him that it sounds like his wife is gay.
She is not She She is gay. Oh dear God. she is
Good day for married people, right?
I'm sorry your husband betrayed you.
I am sorry that your wife is gay. I think women are not great either.
Try to tell my wife.

Hey Ross, will you hand me this knife?
I can not wait to be with you!
I'll sneak by as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
I'm just going to tell Rachel that I'm going to do some laundry for a few hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is this my new nickname?
Awww, do you know what your nickname is, Mr. Big?
Arghh !!

I can not believe that I will lose this job!
Oh, I'm so sorry, man! Can I do anything?
Yes! Help me get this mini fridge past the security guard.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yes?
Well, I do not want to talk to you Wayne!
I hate you!
You ruined my life!
Oh, Chandler, Wayne.
Wayne, shopkeeper.
Hello how are you?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll get your job back if you help me.
Why should I help you?
The reason he just said so.
What do you need?
I-I-I saw you talking on stage with this beautiful woman, do you know Sarah?
What?
And I'm just a love machine too.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.

Oh, I thought that was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He is just the cutest little man!
See you Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for picking!
You struck?
Yes, um, $ 100.
Phoebe! I can not believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed that it is completely unreasonable that they asked me for this money!
Yes, but they did not ask me!
You know?
That's how I know you, the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun.
Yes, but you make me look bad!
No I'm not.
No!
If anything, I'll make you look better!
They see you talking to me and that's - I'm a hit!
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Hello!
Oh hey, Ross.
Um, I thought maybe you two could change the flat because Phoebe is more of our kind of people.
Something to think about.
Yes, okay, my bad one.

All right, good, good ...
Here. I have to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?
What do you think? Today is the big day!
Oh dear God. Okay, go to the bathroom, use whatever you want, just do not tell me what you did there.
Many Thanks!
Where is Joey? His mother is on the phone.
He is in the bathroom. I do not think you want to go in there!
Come on, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...
Who gets loud?
Oh, that would be Monica.
Hey, listen, I want to borrow a few things, Aurora spent the night, I really want to have breakfast.
Oh, you have all night, huh?
Yes, well, I only have twenty minutes to Ethan, so you know ..
Ooh, do I feel a bit of resentment?
No, no grudge, believe me, it's worth it.
"Kay?
Do you know, in a relationship, do you have these key moments that you know you will remember for the rest of your life?
Well, every second is like that with Aurora ... and I've just wasted thirty-five of them talking to you guys, so, um ... Monica, can you help me at the door?
For sure.
Oh, um, Chandler?
You know, those - old Monica - would remind you to scrub this Teflon pan with a plastic brush ... But I will not do that.

Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Hey Joey! Oh, you remember, even though you're a big star!
Oh, come on! It will be years before I forget you!
Joey, how is it in a movie set, right?
Do you have a wardrobe?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Um, well, yes, I have it all.
Yes, listen, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he could not have been more wrong!
Oh oh!
I have to go Monica, my uh, my sushi is here!
I'm sorry. Thank you for waiting.
Everyone is smiling! Okay thank you very much! Enjoy your stay in

Wow, that's so cool, guys. The whole city is darkened!
Mom says it's all Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back.
Wow, guys, that's big.
Pants and a sweater?
Why, mom?
Who will I hit in a blackout?
Power Company guys?
Suitable raiders?
Can we talk about this later?
OK.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and look for my grandma. What is my number?
Well, I never call

What are you doing now?
Swim.
What about the chick?
Chicks do not swim.
Are you sure?
I dont know. Should we try it?
For sure.
You see, I told you they do not swim.
Waiting. Give it a minute.
No! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.

I take care of you, is not a problem, right?
You are safe.
Law?
Okay, I'll use that spit bubble as "Yes, I do!"
Okay, after I got rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I did not mean to scare you.
I just have to clean it up.
OK?
Because let's be honest, we are with Monica.
I broke it.
Well.
Well, that's the way to go.
OK Good.
Why are you just two?
Where is Leslie?
Well, you can not answer.
Leslie?
Where are you Leslie?
Leslie, would be one now

Hello!
Hello.
Hey, why are you wiping your blanket?
Oh, there is banana on it.
You said she was bald.
Yes, she was bald, she is not now.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?
I do not know, I hardly say that about people.
Oh, well, that's just perfect!
Well, I'm sorry, I thought you said it was alright.
Yes, I said what was alright when I thought she was a weird bald woman. I mean, you know, this girl got hair
Well, maybe it will not work. Maybe Ross will not like her personality.
Why does she have a bad personality?
Oh no, Bonnie is the best!

Hello!
Hello.
Do you have a minute? I would like to talk to you about something I am, I really feel uncomfortable.
For sure. What? About you, you shower with your mother?
I actually had a topic in mind! I am, I somehow go through a dry spell, sexually wise.
Whoa, for months?
Excellent! Excellent! And, uh, are you into some weird stuff, you know, sexually?
No!
Oooh, wrong answer.

Ow! My ass. OK. OK. Oh, shh!
No! No!! It's me! It's me! I - I did not want to make a sound!
Then do not break !!
Oh yes, Smokey Joe was halfway to the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a two-year-old.
Why are you smoking then?
Well, it is very disturbing.

Honey, I was wondering ....
Hmm?
Do you still have the navy uniform?
No, I had to bring it to the costume.
Hmm.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
You remember that you do not have sex in high school, right?
Yes.
Honey, what about you?
What?
I mean, are you kidding, do you know, fantasy guys?
No.
Come on, you have to have one!
Pooh!
I do not know Monica.
It feels weird to be here.
I mean, if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, it's like betraying Chandler.
Not at these prices.
Hello. In England, this car would be on the other side of the shop. Wow!
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Oh, that's my new bed. You have to feel this bad boy.
Eh, Monica, it feels weird, you know, Chandler is your friend ... Oh!
Oh dear God!
Oh, alright, take this bed, you can find other friends.

You know, since I was little, I've been able to quarters with my toes.
Good for you. Uh, quarter or quarter rolls?
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with only your heads.
No problem.
Oh, are you sure?
"Really?"
Because you know you could make little dolls of it, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
We can not do that.
What? What can not you do?
Did she really say that?
Well, I added the part "just like me" ...
But she says she is looking for someone, and someone will be there tonight.
"Tonight" tonight?
Well, I think it's perfect.
You know, it's just us both, she's been watching my monkey all day ...
I can not remember the last time I had a girl who took care of my monkey.
Anyway, I thought, after work, I would get a bottle of wine, go over and, um, try to woo her.
Hey, do you know what to do? They should take them back to the 1890s when this sentence was last used.

Car is waiting downstairs, I just wanted to make these copies of my book for your friends. What do you want from Lisbon?
No, just knowing that you will be there is enough.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.
You kissed my best horse! ... or something in that sense.
OK. Look, it was stupid.
Really stupid.
Really stupid.
And I do not even know how it happened.
I'm sorry, darling, I promise it will never happen again.
Are we okay now?
Yes. No. No ...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Shh. He did it. He told her, not just about the kiss, about everything.
You are joking.
No no. He said, "When will you grow up and become a mother?"

Oh, there it is.
This is not your normal dry clean.
I know, but this mischief I did with this date goes, so I have to find a new one.
I also need to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
What?!
A new grocery.
The Universe said I would meet a nice guy and they gave it to me?
If I get up there, I'll kick an ass.
Do not worry, Phoebe, you will meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, you can too.
Yes, we both can. And we both will do it.
Oh, you did not have to come.
Are you kidding? Here they get spots! OK? This is like
OK.
Oh, apologize! I think you dropped yourself Wow!
What?
I'm sorry, just that you're so beautiful.
Oh yes, I'm sorry too, but what will you do?
I hope you do not think I'm crazy, but I feel like I should pick this up, do you believe in that?
A little bit. Now you talk.
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
II would like to. Just let me tell my friend.
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I see how you get this out?
She must have gone.

Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We are in the same team!
Four hours? You have done this for four hours?
That's right, baby.
Okay, let me in.
No no! Do not do it! Not!
What?
He is a dropper!
Oh yes that's true!
I am not a dropper!
It's really an er-three-person game, you know?
It throws and catches!
Well.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Whoa-Whoa folks, it's not a cat!
Oh my God!
I give you up, I do not know what I'm going to do with this thing!
The baking did not help, right?
Good, the place was closed. I will only copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why do not you just come to me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no It's okay, I mean I-look, Rach, I know, I scared you off with the whole Naked Thursday thing, but we do not have to do that!
Well, it would be easier to just move across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday.
Thursday is clearly not good for you, choose a day!

So these are two boxes of Holiday macaroons. In the name of the Brown Birds of America, I welcome you.
Admit it, Chandler, you have no backhand.
Excuse me, I have a very solid backhand.
To shield your face and scream like a girl ... is not a backhand.
I screamed ... like a marine.
All right here. Watch me play the three P's of the championship game. Power. Precision. and penache.

She is not much of a telephone operator.
Yeah, well, um, well, what's that deal with this dad, I mean, if somebody has my baby somewhere, I want to know, you know?
Hey, kink fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Oh no.
Okay, look, maybe I should just go.
Maybe you should.
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Do you know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players lead the team.
Oh, that's not true.
Oh, it is.
It is not.
It is.
Is not!

Okay, ladies, that ends today's class and let's think about it, let's be safe out there.
It's a great class.
Many Thanks.
Yes, yes, I watched.
Um, hey, a few questions.
Um, about that last train the woman stumbled upon and then pinned to the ground, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam her
No no no. No. What would happen
Who? I the attacker?
I'm sorry, Chandler, you know that you're such a cute guy and I, I do not want to hurt you.
Oh, I wish I could do something to make you feel better.
No-no-really ?!
Of course!
Well, it hurts so much. I am
Oh I am sorry.
Well, maybe there is one thing you can do.
What?! Something! Something!
Well, I um, I mean, that's just from my head now, um, but I have this friend.
This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I would do that mmmm, would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie on Thursday?
Absolute! But you - would you really feel better if I refused you, if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. See you later.

Okay, I understood that. I'll escape over there. I will come back here. Alright, come on
Hey guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I've already tackled the game before - oh my god! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
They are all Chandlers.
Chandler sucks! He could not have gotten it right!
I did. But it had a price.
But Ben comes by tonight and he can not see that.
Come on, at seven, kids have seen orgies. Was it just me?

For sure!
Okay, I thought we should have a nice guest room, right?
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
And we could have a roll-top table with comment cards so people can say how much they loved staying here !!
Okay, whatever, I really did not think about it that much.
Well, I like this idea.
Obviously!
I thought maybe - maybe - maybe it could be a game room, you know?
I mean, you can buy old arcade games like uh, like
No.
Okay, you mean no like in "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea, let's talk about it before we completely reject it."
Oh, I am sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, um, talk about it, but no.
So, that was it?
I just do not think arcade games go into the beautiful guest room. The beautiful room will be filled with antiques.
Why
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I have nothing against the beautiful guest room, especially since everyone we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Are you mocking me?
No, I do not mock you, or you nice room.

You know, I love crossword puzzles with you sweetheart!
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
OK! There are only one, three letters, no dog, but
Cat.
Yes! You're so smart! I love you.
I love you too.

I never sucked, I did not want you to know how good I was!
Why?
I dont know.
This is so great! Now we can participate in double tournaments!
This is

Hello!
Hello. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim did it
But
No! No no! He is completely incompetent. I called the cook who recommended it to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
OK. Okay, but you can not fire it today.
Why not?!
Because I'm leaving him today.
What?! You said he was cute!
He
Just do not take your phone off.
Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
What? So may I not fire him now?
You can not fire him and kick him out the same day, he'll kill himself.
Okay, then I'll shoot him today and you'll go out with him for another week.
Are you kidding?! Another week with this sip, I will kill
Okay, then we'll do it both today and he'll have to put up with it!
OK. But the question is, who will go first. Because whoever comes second is the bitch.
"Really?" That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.

This is the last boarding for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Well, I - I think I have to go.
Oh, my Bing-a-Ling. I will wait for you. Do you even know how long you will be away?
Well, until we find an energy source to replace the fuel.
Oh. Well, I will correct you every day. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Chandler?
No!
Chandler!
Janice!
There you are!
There you are!
I had to have one last kiss, and also - you said you'd go right after I got on the plane!
No! No! I want to see you start.
Well, I guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! If we come to Yemen, can I stay with you?

Hello!
Hello.
Hey-Ooh, how is Hilda? Is she training?
Ohh, my new assistant is training, yes.
Was she happy that you gave her the job?
Oh, my ... my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Hello?
Oh hello!
Can you, can you wait a second?
They are the producers of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
can you excuse me for a minute?
Hey, funny, that you should call.
I was just thinking about the script of the next week.
Canceled?!
As if they take it from the air?
Ohh.
Alright, see you Monday.
We do not shoot her anymore? !!
Alright, bye!
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
We are sorry.
I'm sorry, Joey.
Why should they do this ?! It was a good show, right?

It's so remote up here.
I know. I like it up here.
I feel like we are the only two people in the world. Oops. We are sorry.
What's wrong dear? Did you see a little mouse?
No no! Big Bear! Big bear outside! I think I - I - would you - actually, would you check that?
Honey, we have no bears here.
Well, okay. Would you pick one for me?
OK. I'll be right back.
OK. What?! What are you doing here?!
What are
I came with Paul!
Yes, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!
Here you go honey!
Ahh. Many Thanks!
Diet Coke
What the hell was that ?!
A lesson in the meaning of Unagi.
Oh,
Perhaps. Now I'm curious as to when you would have started during those girlish cries
All right, we were not
I am sorry that I had to take such drastic measures to clarify my point of view, but I - I just want you to be safe.

What do you do?
I lean back. Here I lean on.
OK. (Goes over and fluffs the pillows on the couch.
Brenda a bee!
What?
Yes! It flew into your blouse and you should better loosen your buttons so it does not sting you!
I think I know what's going on here.
They do?
Look, I know, it must be hard for your wife to be lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
I understand completely. Can I

Good, let's do it!
No no no. What was that?
I know it was the best I could make of it.
Well, people!
People, people, people.
Let's try again, and this time we see how everyone watches Joey.
Show them how it's done.
Count it off.

So, what did he decide? Does your uncle Nathan get an invitation or not?
Oh God, no one likes him, and he's so cheap that he would never fly to London in a million years.
Yes, invite him?
Hey, did I do that properly?
Yes, they are fine.
Yes?
When someone asks, let's just say that Ben spoke to them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
For sure. Why not?
"Really?"
Yes?
I do not think that I would feel comfortable there with my old lovers.
Wait, wait, wait, do you think, maybe we should not invite them?
Oh, no, no, you know that I absolutely adore Rachel, it's just that, well, it could be an awkward thing for you.
But it is absolutely your decision.
More tea?
Yes sure.
Earl Gray?
Huh? Yeah, well, invite whoever you want.

Hello.
Hello!
Hello! How was the doctor?
Oh, everything went great.
Well.
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Oh.
I do not see the baby. Where is it?
Oh no, I know I did not see it at first, but it's right, um, Ross, I lost it again.
Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.

Excuse me?
Could you help me with something?
The patient I am looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
And um, he's like early to mid thirties, very attractive.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Oh yeah! Great! Okay, in which room number is he?
I am sorry that this information is limited to hospital staff
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Dr. Drake, who?
Remover. It is Portuguese. We need this information; I am a doctor.
A doctor in this hospital?
Damn woman, we are losing precious time! Do you want the blood of this man on your head?
Hands.
Hands!
It is absolutely important that you tell me in which room the man my assistant has described remains.
He is a patient of mine, I treat him for years!
He is in room 816.
816, thanks!
Many Thanks.
And what 's his name?
No!

Hello!
Hello!
Rachel just helped me. My head got all sunburned.
Awww.
Thank you so much.
Oh, you're welcome a million.
Okay, see you in our room.
Yes.
Oh dear God.
I know.
Okay, I have to go.
Whoa! What?! Why?!
Well, I have to separate from Bonnie.
Here?! Now?!
Good yes.
I can not - I can not stay here all night, and if I go in there, then she will ... want to do something.
What happened?
He can not do it, he's stuck in Chicago.
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo happy!
Stupid, useless Canadian money!

Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his wallet. A Joshua Bergen.
"Really?"
Are you going to call him?
Yes!
I will!
Absolute!
(She takes out her driver's license and her license and holds her opposite.
She continues to act like Dark Helmut in

Oh dear God! That is fine!
I am full, and yet I know that if I stop eating, I will regret it.
Hello!
Hello!
What you have there?
Oh, it's um, it's tofu cake. Do you want something?
What are you doing tonight?
Huh? um
Buddy! Buddy!
Oh! We are sorry. Uh, I have these plans with Phoebe, why?
Really? Um, Monica said she has a date at 9:00.
What?! This evening?!
That's what Monica said.
After she gave me this big speech?!
She goes and makes a date with a guy the same night she plans with me?
I think she's trying to make a quick move on Big Daddy!

Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Who cares? I turn women off.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no !!! You can not come in here! R-r-r-Ross is naked.
What?!
It's yours!
Yeah well, I'm - I'm a bitch.
Me too.
Hello Jill!
Hello!
Hello .
Rachel.
Rachel! Well, you - you are not home, you are - you are - you are right here.
Yes, I know, and I bet you thought it was funny. But it is not!
OK. Alright, I'll have his house at midnight.

This part was perfect for me! I can not believe that I did not understand it!
I'm sorry, man.
Hey, do you know what to do?
You should let something happen for yourself.
You know, write a piece right away.
Write a movie!
Huh?
I mean, what about those?
Come on Ross is realistic, you know? If I wrote something, what would be the chance that these guys could play in it?
Wait a second, I could start in it!
Or that.
I can not write!
You mean, I-I-I'm an actor, I do not have the discipline that you need, you know?
I can not do it.
I'll help you.
Yes, I will set a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
And besides, it will give me something to do.

Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography are you doing?
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models from time to time, I hope that's cool.
Yes that is cool. Because I have models here, you never know .......
Oh yes, during the summer I spend most of my weekends at my sister's beach house, which you can use by the way.
Although, I should probably tell you, she is a pornstar.
Well, listen, ah, another person to meet you, but if it turns out to be your sister, I think your chances are pretty good.
Well.

As bad as that was, I really enjoyed it. I think I'll apologize for all the stupid things I do.
Why do not you just stop doing stupid things? Then you would not have to apologize.
I would really love it if I could do both.
Alright, I have to ask.
What?
Do you want to break up with me when I get fat again?
What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
One hundred and forty-five pounds.
Yes, yes it is. It's uh everytime on the lips! Why?! Why on the lips?!
Here is Frannie. Hmm, will not she be happy to see me?
Now wait, you're nice! Well? I did not bring you here so you can attack her.
Frannie was the one who found you
This slut!
Monica! What
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Hello Frannie, congratulations.
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me ?!
Why?!
What - why do not you want me at your wedding?
What could I possibly have done?
Stuart!
I think you know my husband.
So it's really a question of

Hey ladies! What are you here for?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yes?
It is a crime that you and I do not spend more time together.
How are you?
Well, I've heard you thought about asking Phoebe to move in with you, and I thought maybe we should talk.
Man to me.
For sure. OK.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you crazy? If you live at Phoebe, you will be two, live together!
Yes, I - I thought about it. I only know that it would make me happy.
You mean fear.
No, I mean happy.
Hello! Oh, listen, I've just cleared some space for your stuff.
Oh thanks, but listen, I've just been to Monica and she and Chandler had a big fight and they do not move in.
What do you mean, they do not feed? You - they still move right?
No, no, they only had a big punch over what I should do to my room.
What?! About a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel a bit bad for her, but I'm really crazy because I do not have to move in here!
Oh no, yes no, this part is great!

Yes
Lockout !!
Where are you going? Come on, another game!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Yes, go out!
You always squat in my apartment!
Come on, I'll just use my left hand, right?
Come on, women!
Okay I have to go.
I'm leaving, and I'm gone.
Another game?
Oh yeah!

I'm so sorry.
Oh. Do not go.
No, I-II-I have to go.
No! No! No! No!
Honey, honey, people are looking.
I do not care! I do not care !!
Yes, um, I'm leaving now.
You can not go! I have your shoe!
Goodbye Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those in Burgty.

Oh how!
What?
Yes, I know what I wanted to ask you.
Um, can you roll your tongue?
Because I can, and my mother could not, and I thought you knew I got something from my dad.
What, wait, do you mean so?
Yes / Yes. You can do it.
You do not do it.
Oh yes, okay, my mother could, and I can not. We do not have that ....
Where there is no fear of commitment.
Do we have any ... Do we have any thoughts here?
Well, I never went through the tunnel myself, because as I understand it, you can not drive through more than one girl in the car, right.
But it seems to me, it's pretty much like everything else, you know, face your fear.
It is afraid of heights, you go to the top of the building!
If you are afraid of bugs ... you get a bug.
Law.
In that case you are afraid of engagement, so I say you go in and you're the most dedicated guy ever.
Surprisingly, that makes sense.
You think?
Oh yeah. Come on, man, jump from the high dive, staring into the barrel of the gun and peeing in the wind!
Yes, Joe, I assure you, when I look into the barrel of a gun, I pee pretty much in all directions.

Hello! Hello!
Hello!
Hello! Appearance! I developed our pictures from the Rockefeller Center.
Oh cool! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to see pictures of me and Mona skating?
Oh, um, I would normally love too, but I'm inundated right now.
Hey where-where are the pictures that the scary pretzel seller took from us?
Oh yes, probably in the end. Oh dear God! He just took pictures of my breasts!
I miss the picture time?
You know, she has a face Ross!
OK. Okay, here's a good one.
Impressive!
That's a good one!
Wow, it looks like one, like a Christmas card, you know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
You know, every year I say, I'll send Christmas cards, and I never do.
Do you want, do you want to send this out together?
Together? Do I like people?
Yes, you know? Happy holidays of Mona and Ross. It's getting cute, okay?
OK.
Oh, I have to work. Call me later?
Sure sure.
Bye people.

I mean, I do not feel like having a girlfriend anymore.
Do you want me to quit my job so you can feel like a friend?
Is it about Mark?
Oh dear God.
Okay, it is not, it is not.
Oh dear God. I can not have the same fight with you Ross! Look, um, maybe we should take a break.
Good, you're right.
Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogurt or something ..
No, a break from us.

Bing! We are ready for tonight, 8 o'clock.
Oh, it turns out we can not do it. Monica has to work.
Oh, my ex-wife did not work, unless you're calling to do her maternity work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
Oh, well, tomorrow is not good for her either.
Oh? Why not?
It is the semi-final of her musty ball tournament.
What's up with Bing? Does your wife have a problem with me or something?
Well, now - now you're just talking crazy.
Why can not we three go out together?
Because we - we part. Monica and I separated. Hold me tight.
Good God, Bing. I can not say that I am completely surprised. I saw her looking at you, and there was no love.
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
You know, what would really help me in this difficult time is something to choke. Can I choke you?
Bing my boy, we'll get you over it.
Now is the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.
Oh no, no, Monica would freak out. But hell with that bitch.

Look at you, sweet and innocent, asleep like an angel ... with Emma's pudgy little hands wrapped around you.
It's okay, Emma, ​​you stay asleep.
: Get away from the crib, I have a gun!
It's okay, it's okay. Rach, it's me. Take off the hair tie.
What do you do?
Well, I heard Emma move, so I wanted to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Oh, oh thanks. Alright, now that I'm upstairs I'm going to the bathroom.
There's a treasure ... That's not over yet.

Did he call?
No sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he would call. Why did not he call?
Maybe he is hinted at by very smart, strong and successful women.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why did not he call, Rachel? Why?
Okay, okay. Um, well, maybe, maybe he feels weird because you're my boss.
Embarrassing? Why should he feel embarrassed?
Well...
The only person who should feel uncomfortable is you, and you did not tell him not to call me, right?
No, I...
Because if you feel uncomfortable, if your friend is with someone you work for, there are always ways to fix it.

And you're upset because you did not make your best friend cry?
I mean, everything I ask for is just a little emotion!
Is that asking too much after six years ?!
I mean something?
Are-Are-are not Rachel and I as close as you?
I mean, are not we having so much fun!
Do not I deserve a few tears? !!
I mean we - we told Joey, he pulled his eyes out!
Hello!
I did not cry my eyes !!
Come on!
It's like the end of an era!
No more J-Man and Channies!
!
Okay, I have to ask, who calls us that ?!

Do I know why we are rushing?
Yeah, you know, ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?
Well, it turns out that she, oh, she wants to come back with me.
Oh, I found it!
!
That's great for you!
Yes!
Good luck with your girlfriend.
Oh thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel !!!!
Hello. Ohh, you got my message.
Yeah, oh hey, you're just right.
So, what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, you can do that very much.
Ahhh!

Oh! I am sorry! I think, I think that could have missed the table!
Do
Ah,
Do
Ah,
DO YOU?
You know, I do not understand why they did not cry. It was a nice speech.
Oh come on.
Hello!
All the stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we learned a lot from mom and dad!
And this picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
And what did you say about Nana?
Ohh, yes, she really wanted to be there.
And you know what?
I think she was.
Oh, good God, Ross! How the hell are you doing this?

You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Yes.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so you must have written it.
Oh, people, with that joke. I have to say, I know I cracked, but I'm not even sure I understood.
What, did not you understand? The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can not write out recipes.
You can not laugh about my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think the 'Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah dollars.

I can not find garbage bags!
Oh, I think I saw a few here.
What is it?!
I dont know! But maybe, if we keep this drawer closed, she'll die.
I can not believe that we live here!

You still have not told Rachel that you are not really suggesting?
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took out her breast.
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?
I did not look at it. The stupid baby's head blocked most of it.
Go and tell Rachel before Ross finds out.
Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I do not want to hurt her.
Okay, look, just make it gentle.
You're right.
You're right.
II will tell her now, before Ross finds out, and I will be gentle.
I can do that.
I am a gentle person.
Oh by the way.
Two people screwed in there, if you want to check that.

Hello, Pheebs?
Okay, so I just talked to the nurse and the reason your doctor is late is because she is not coming.
What?!
Okay, um, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and um, it's like those really scary manners in England.
Which
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh, let's see here, Rachel Green?
Um, well, I have to say it's a tragic love story.
Well, that's a matter of course, but yes. Anyone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the uh, wildness of manners, the
Excellent! What Rachel has been watching here
You completely stole my answer!
Well, honey, that was pretty obvious.
Well, how would you know that ?! You have not even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
I think that your question is a question with many answers.
Would you like to dare?
Would
Do you only repeat what I say?
Are you just repeating what?
Okay, let's move on.
Alright.

Okay, okay, that's great, uh, Chandler, you're behind the desk.
And - if she hopes to come in, she will not recognize you because, well, why should she?
Uh, okay, and then you're gonna sigh Ross and me.
You're Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be um, Mr. Wong.
Diverse.
Has anyone demanded security?
You're cool.
Okay, who of you is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?
Where is my ring? The wedding ring of my dead grandmother? Where is it? Where is it?
A way to be cool, man.
What is he talking about?
There was a ring in a box on my bedside table, after you left, it was gone!
Wait, you think I stole a ring?
We know you were so fair - just save time and confess!
Okay, who are you?
The Hardy guys?
Look, I do not have to steal a stupid ring, okay?
I do $ 1,600 a week, which I do; does one of you do that?
Marry me.

Oh dear God! Joey!
Hell yes! I'll marry you!
You can not marry him!
Hey lady, your day is over! It's my turn!
Phoebe!
Why?! Why can not she marry me ?!
I can and I will!
She is not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel is the one who is pregnant.
Oh dear God.
Hello!
Phoebe: I think he'd notice if you did not have a baby in nine months!
It's Joey!
I can not believe it now! What? Rachel is pregnant? Who is the father?
We do not know it.
Ohh I wonder if that guy.
There is a guy?
Yes.
Who? Who is it?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I did not see who it was
Was this story over?
The guy left that.
Oh dear God! I know who the father is
People have to finish their stories!

Oh my god, you're back!
Oh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I want to see what's in your hands. I want to see the garbage.
Yes.
Ohhh! Oh, everything is dirty. You should throw that out.
No!
Me too!
Hey, when the music starts again, I thought about getting into the robot, you know?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we do not want to look stupid!
Alright, we're back! Ten seconds left, we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Three two one!
Cut!
No! Year! Happy no year!
Okay, here's where we go to Times Square's live recording, nice work for those who are a wrap!

So Lizzie, are you-you-want to spend the night?
Oh no, believe me, I'm going as fast as possible!
Well. Well. Not that we do not want you to stay, of course you're welcome - how much more homework do you have?
Aha. You know, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
No!
No she does not.
Uh Phoebe, what she does - that's uh - they're sock rabbits.
They are completely different - Okay!
OK!
OK!
I did not make it!
I am sorry!
I totally forgot tonight and the fact that we should do it
Oh that's okay. Not me
No, no, it's not okay!
It is not!
I mean you were just you are so incredible!
You've been through all the time and effort to make this band for me!
You know, I'm just - I, I'm going to do it to you!
I will!
II will go
Well, I've been thinking a lot about the band.

No. And then I called him and he was not there.
Well then he is, he's probably out there right now.
Oh, thanks, that's very helpful, I'm glad you came by.
Hello.
Hello! It's me.
Hello! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
"Really?" I've been thinking, this is crazy, I do not mean, do not you think we can work on it?
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Who is he?
Nobody.
Is it alright if I finish the apple juice?
Is that Mark?
Umm, honey, look, he just came to ....
Yes! I have it!
Hey, dinosaurs, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Ah, that's okay, thanks.
Hey, you do not have to smile. You just have to dance.
Look, I do not feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. OK?
Oh ok. Hey, two beers.

Do you want to go to the bedroom? It is a little more comfortable.
For sure.
OK. Oh, wait! Um, did you send these contracts to Milan?
If that's your idea of ​​sexy talk?
No, seriously, do you know the contracts I gave you, did you visit them overnight?
Which contracts?
Okay, please tell me that this is just one of your jokes you do that I do not get.
Like what?
Do you know how that thing when you put the phone in your pants?
Label!
I'm serious!
That's not funny!
These contracts had to go out today!
Rach, I'm sorry, but you did not give me any contracts!
Yes I have! And I put down a little
I tell you, you never gave it to me.
Do you know what day, if we went to the office, you would see these contracts on your desk.
No, I would see you look embarrassed because they are
Or maybe you see me embarrassed because you're talking on the phone with your step!
Do you want to go to the office now?
No! Come on, we will not go to the office.
Okay I understand. I do not want to be wrong.
Okay, get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Good work!

Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, that's my good friend Ross.
I am pleased to meet you.
Oh, and I have to talk to you.
About what?
To see if you know what these people are talking about.

Pheebs, how are you?
I am okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they are having fun? Am I speaking too fast?
No, listen like me. Pheebs, it's going great. See Chandler with the little girl Chandler.
Little girl Chandler, where have I heard this before?
Oh right, Coach Ruben.
Do you know what Pheebs?
If you're over there, we also have a situation over here.
Well, no, we're all responsible for our own babies.
You see, there I think you're wrong. We played these babies man by man; We should really play a zone defense.
What do you think?
Forgive me? You have not accepted my calls for a week!
Well, I'm totally into Chandler. For ever friends! Do not come out of here!
Uh, what was that?
uh,

... I am, I'm fine.
That sounds good. I'll call you - or you call me, whatever ...
OK.
Bye.
Whoo-hoo!
Yes, let's go!
Second date!
...I do not know.
you
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but the whole thing about her came all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?

Do you remember that a child and your mother would drop you off at the cinema with a jar of jam and a spoon?
You're so pretty.
Hello!
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, oh, do you know the guy who followed me? I talked to him today.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?

Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Well, that's garbage. Young lady, you can not Hey! Stop this young lady, she has donated garbage!
Hello!!
The charity is burning!
Help!
Oh good!
Thanks, I need that.
Whoa!
What's this?!
It is nine o'clock in the morning!

May I help you?
Uh, where - where is the guy deciding which pictures to put on the wall?
He is not here right now.
Oh, you're kidding!
Alright, so tell him Joey Tribbiani came by to drop all those clothes.
OK?
I am an actor; I get my photo up there on the wall.
You know, there are two people who can put your picture up there.
Really? Well, maybe you go and I drink? You are the other right?

Yes, and it totally scared me! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and that only spurred you on.
What?! You are crazy! There is nothing sexual about the sounds I make!
"Really?"
There is nothing sexual about that?
Oooh.
Oh God!
Ohh.
Ohhhh.
Ohh.
Where are you looking?!
I mean hi.
Oh my ... that's so embarrassing. Oh my god, I will never be massaged again!
No, that can not stop you from getting massages!
No look, I have, I have many customers who make the same sounds that you do!
Really?!
Well, not customers, lovers. But let us know, try again. Come back and - and we'll work it through.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I guess.
Great! Okay, if you just apologize. Did you hear something you liked?

No !!!
Yes!
No !!
Yes!!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! They know that.
Okay, here is the thing. We'll get you a coffee and you'll never know you're drunk.
Really?! You promise?
Yes, I will take care of it.
OK. I love you above all.
Okay, we have to do something against your breath.
How about
That's still yours. Okay, now remember, it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
OK. I can do that.
OK.
Surprise!!!

Thanks for the coffee, or thank you for the coffee, Gunter.
Yes, we are done.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to see this new Imax movie about tide pools?
Really?!
But I have Knicks tickets for you, me and Chandler.
Sweet!
Well, well finish your coffee; Let's go.
Ah, no, no, only Ross. Ross and Joey are embarrassing enough.
Um, I'm sorry, I can not even do it. I'll see Mona again tonight.
I understand: Who would cancel an actual appointment to go to a fake bachelor party?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel tonight, baby

So it's up to these two, Nancy, I know you like this one and I think I agree with you. Rachel, what do you think?
Well, um, that's pretty but uh, I just, I love this fabric Sorry.
Oh, do not worry, that's part of your job here to express your opinion, and then I'll pay tribute to them - I'm kidding.
She makes jokes, but never contradict her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Oh, what a funny office.
I do not know any, but I know I need a cigarette.
So, what do you say, we take a break, we go outside, and we'll find out when we come back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my dad is a doctor and he always told me horror stories about ghosts and goblins who fully supported the princess's right to smoke.

What?
Peach pit.
Yes, bunny?
Peach pit. That night we had ...
Peaches?
Actually nectarines, but basically ...
Could have been a peach.
Then, uh, then we dressed, and I-I ... I took her to the bus stop. I am fine.
Hey, this woman has an ass like Carol! What? Thought we tried to find things.

Well!
Westminster Abbey!
Hands down, best abbey I've ever seen.
Hello!
OK.
What do you think of the abbey, Chandler?
I think it's great. It is great. You know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
"Really?" What?
To put the camera away !!!
Man,
You know, I can not believe I get my fingernails! And
Chandler, there's a guy over there.
This is a postman! This is
Chandler, do not worry! That does not make you any less a guy!
Hey, do you know who had such nails?
Hmm.

Uh ... I do not know, I do not know.
What?
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly that thing?
Rachel?
Yes.
Do you remember when you were here for the first time, how you were trained for two weeks by another waitress?
Oh sure! Do you need me to train someone new?
Good one. Actually, Terry wants you to take the training off each time.
Uh, do you believe that?
Yes?

Hey darling, you're the one with the little girl, you said we'd get the kind with the baby.
No, you said the baby is sneaking you out.
No, the little girl sneaks out of me.
You said the baby.
Why should the baby crawl me?
Why should the little girl crawl you?
You people, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little bit slower?
This is in your book?
Yes, it's about relationships. You know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, continue. This stuff is great!
What?! Excuse me!
And how does not matter if people really love each other.
And how people believe what you tell them, as long as it's a compliment.

Yes!!!!
Yes, I did it!
I am punctual!
Okay, why do not we open all our books on page 23?
Where, where you see a bunch of uh red spots.
Okay, um, why not, why do not you all start reading while I-

Fine. Well! Just keep going! Well?
Horse! What are you sorry for, sir? I just think he really likes you.
Hello! Do you know the teacher who had a baby with her student?
What the? What
Hello!
Young lady? May I help you?
Okay, do not look, do not be angry, okay?
But after I unpacked the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you, so I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything and then I forgot where it is, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you scared of me or something?
Do you want me to be scared of you?
Of course not.
I mean, Chandler, what you did, it's a wonderful thing and I appreciate it very much.
I know that I have this weird thing where I want everything to be perfect, but I would never expect you to worry about it.
"Really?"
Of course!
Oh, you are the best. You come to me.
Alright, okay? The important things first. Okay, now Ross was sitting

Okay, that's it. I can not make that decision! It is
A Magic Eight Ball ?! You can not be serious, you can not make that decision with a toy!
Oh, that's not a toy.
Well, I do not know what else to do.
I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends, or I'll keep my friend and get divorced for the second time before I'm 30!
If someone has a better suggestion, let us hear it!
Because I - I have nothing!
All right, do not be shy, any suggestion will do it.
Alright.
Here we go.
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?
Ask again later.
Later is not good enough.
Ask again later.
What the hell!
That is broken!
It's broken!
Okay, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Do not count on it. Seems like I'm fine.

Excuse me.
Yes?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Yes.
Can-Can I can get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.

I think she took it pretty well. You know that Paolo is just over there, so ...
Ah ... Ooh! Looks like we kicked your asses.
No, she kicked us in the butt. You could be in the Olympic standing team.
Come on, two to one.
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to fly in!
What now?
Yes, now is when you push!
You have to make sure that when Paolo leaves, the first guy Rachel sees is you. She needs to know that you are everything that he is not!
You are like, like the Anti-Paolo!
My catholic friend is right.
She is desperate.
You are there for her.
You record the pieces and then you introduce the age of Ross!

Well, I just called Joshua
Oh, how did it go?
Well, I've done my best to convince him that I'm not a crazy girl who desperately wants to marry - I've had a hard time.
What did he say?
Well, his answering machine was
Ohh, honey! Hey, I bet you, he'll call you again.
Yes, maybe, but I do not think I care.
I do not think he's the one I'm sad about.
You know, I know that I totally agree that Ross marries, but as it turns out, I do not think I'm so good at it.
Yes, perhaps.
And I - I'm just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
Well, you know how Ross and I were back on, off again, off again, off again?
I think I figured we were somewhere across the street.
Once again. You know what? I think we all did it.
Hello!
I do not get it!
It was in my room the whole night!
And if she did not take it and I did not take it; and you did not take it, who did?
Shh!
We try to think!

That's the unit for you, my friend. Robust construction, many stowage compartments, some big enough for a grown man.
What?!
Oh yeah!
I went in there once myself.
My roommate bet five dollars I could not and then stuck a board through the handles that locked me up.
Yes.
It was funny until I started to feel like being in a coffin.
No, you, you can not fit in the thing. That is not deep enough.
Oh yeah? If I can not, I'll knock five dollars off the price.
All right, you have a deal yourself.
OK. See?! Did I tell you!
Sometimes I come in here, just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel !!

Hello! How are you?
Hello!
Hey-hey, who is your friend? Hello!!
Hey Joey!
Erin! Still here!
Yes, we spent the day together and had a great time!
Why not? Erin is great! Then - then you are there.
Ohh, listen. I have to go. Today was great, thanks!

I think I brought half the beach back in my hair. It was so much easier when I shaved my head.
You know, I have to tell you, me only
Really?!
Ohh!
Because I think about scrapping everything again someday.
Really?!
Yes!
I mean, you should definitely do that.
Do you know what, I should do it.
Yes!
Yes, thank you Rachel, you are so cool.
Awww, stop. Come on. Now shave that head!
Well.

Oh, Monica. You still do not go over the thing.
This woman lives my life.
What?
She lives my life and she does it better than me!
Look at that, look.
She buys tickets for games that I want to see.
She, she buys clothes from shops that intimidate me from the sellers.
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You are not an artist.
Yes, I could be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all that stuff. Just not me.
I can not believe that you would really say that. I would rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Under no circumstance! Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right, he must be the best snack there is.
I do not know, you do not want to mess with corn nuts. You are crazy.
Oh dear God. You! You have to come, look at this! There's something bad out there with a telescope!
I can not believe it! He looks directly at us!
Oh, that's so sick.
I feel hurt. And not in a good way.
How can people do that? ... Oh, people, look! Ugly naked guy has gravity boots!

Man, that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw this ball around?
Yes, it is amazing that it took so long.
I know. My arm kills me.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Do you know how did I get that reputation as a dropper? OK? I am

Hey Rach, can you give that to me?
Yes!
Go!!
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh dear God!
OK! OK! OK! See you in 3 to 4 hours.
Oh!

Hello!
Hello! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh, thanks, thanks.
So Monica tells me you do not want to play anymore because me and you know my talent.
Is that true?
Well, somehow. Yes. Yes.
pheebs
Ah, oh god. Oh, darling, oh, that's okay.
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.

Hello.
I just saw a woman feeding both twins at the same time; It's like a freak show up here.
What's happening?
Nothing.
What is it? Hello!
Really, it's nothing. I'm just
Rach come on, right?
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I will be all alone.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Oh please, he will be with his real family, the twins and little new breasts.
Okay, how long have I watched this woman?
I'm just saying that Ross will one day meet someone and he will have his own life. Law?
Yes I think so.
I never thought that I would raise this baby alone. Pretty stupid, right?
Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing ?!
I just found out that this is Chandler's office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!

Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffee house at six.
We said seven!
We said six!
The only way I said six would not be six if the seven met at seven.
Yes, and if I had seven, maybe I would have said something like, "Wow, my friend is such a wise ass - seven!"
Hello!
Oh my god.
Pooh!
I know what time you said.
What?!
Well, actually, I know when Chester and Marcia said it.
You, go out of my shop!
Well, what did he do?
He went out with my wife!
Joey!
Whoa Whoa Who Whoa, I-I-Hey! I did
This is my wife!!! Go out!
Well, we should go.
Yes.

You know, I really did not have to take myself to the airport.
Oh please.
Every moment is precious.
You know?
Besides, someone in the other taxi had to drive the rest of your suitcase, and your friends do not really seem to care about you leaving.
Well, we really are not that close. Okay, I think that's uh, then bye.
No! No! It's not goodbye, I'm not leaving until you get on the plane.
No, I'm afraid I will not be as good as he can love.
Yes, I wanted the metaphor.
Yes, and I said the actual words.
So big that Joey has a lot of girlfriends, that does not mean he's great in bed.
We share a wall! Either he's great in bed, or she likes to agree with him.
Sweetie, it will be different with you. The sex will be great because you - you are in love.
Yes?
Yes!
Just do it Chandler.
Yes, you should.
Yes, you really should.
Go on.
Alright, alright, I'll go to sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm only doing it for you.

: I'm sure a dancer, there's no point margge will never go for me.
Come Treeger, do not say that.
You just need ahh, you just need more practice.
Come, let us ahh, let's try again.
Come on.
Besides, it was probably mostly my fault.
I mean, you know, I'm not really that comfortable with a-we-hey !!
Hello!
: Yes!

Oh I
Are you sure? I'll bet there is another flight to Minsk
July. Um,
That's really beautiful. What does that mean?
Please, clean my cups. I do not get much out of the lab.
It's good. I have to admit, I thought it was something else.
Yeah, I really wanted to say, um, that, but um, I thought I probably should not do it, because you know I have to go.
You're right! You're right. Do not say it.
II do it.
Me too.
Bye Phoebe.
Okay, now is not the time Joey. Well? You can yell at me tomorrow.
I know.
Oh-oh, wait, did you hear that?
Look, I'm getting something from your grandmother, she said you should give Rachel the purple chair because you're supposed to keep the one-bedroom apartment?
No, I do not hear that.

Yes, I - I heard. I think it's great! Oh, I'm so happy for you!
Oh, well, that's great!
Yes! Yes!
I can not believe you are getting married!
Yes.
Monica and Rachel have stolen.

Oh!
Why are we in bed together?
I dont know. Do you have any clothes on?
Yes.
Really?!
No!
But we - we did not have any sex - um, right?
I mean, I do not remember much last night, it was such a blur.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
And we did not have sex.
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we did not do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.

What do we do now?
I say, we go with you
Chandler?
Has she already seen us? Did she see us?
Janice, what are you doing, what are you doing here?
What is that smell?
I know!

Hello, do you remember us?
Oh ok. You just called a while ago to require a signature on the registration form. Well, it turns out we need one
I am. I am
Yes, and and, I will pay for it with a check.
Yes, I know ... ..I'm not that good either.

Hey, Mon, if you wanted to sleep with Joshua tonight, which one would you like to wear?
You know what? It
We are sorry.
I'm so excited!
I've been waiting for it for months!
I dyed my hair!
I got new sheets!
I make him one
Um-hmm.
What do I do it by the way?
Well, you make him a fries salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, fried asparagus and salmon au croup.
I thought I made him Filet Mignon?
Yes, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you still have something left in the restaurant.
And then you realized that you would stop cooking if you complained, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and diet coke.
Wow, I really get grumpy when I cook.

Chandler! It happens to many people! You-you-were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, do not worry about that!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated.
You know, it's like um, biology!
Which is weird because I'm in high school, I - I failed biology and biology failed me tonight.
Listen. Okay, I can play this when the guests come. OK.
Phoebe!
If you had brought me to the end, he goes on to say that he is probably not gay.

You fall asleep deeply.
Deeper.
Deeper.
Deeper.
You are sleeping completely now.
You do not have to smoke.
Cigarettes do not control you.
You are a strong, self-confident woman who does not have to smoke.
A strong, confident woman.
Thank you for your patience, you are the next caller.
Yes!! Yes!! I am the next caller! You hung up on me.
Hello! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theater?
Of course not.
No.
OK. I just wanted them to hear it from someone else.

How is Paul?
Well.
Although you know, he is a private person.
You know, I wish I could make him open a bit, share a few feelings.
That's easy! You just have to think about him - as a jar of cucumbers that will not open.
So what do you say I should run him under hot water and hit his head against a table.
No, that's what you do, if you want to know the truth of someone.
Hi sweetheart.
Hello!

Okay, Ben, I will not tell your daddy that you have ice cream for dinner unless you tell us about our little incident.
Monica, number one, I do not think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I ... what ?!
You said number two.
I also said number one.
Remind me to discuss with you which pot is decaffeinated and which is regular.
Can not I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
Okay good.
Gunther, you know what, I'm a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?
Because I do not care.
I do not care.
I do not care which pot is regular and which pot is decaffeinated. I do not care where the tray is, I do not care, that's not what I want to do.
So I do not think I should do it anymore.
I will give you my weekly ad.
What?!
Gunther, I stopped.
Does that mean we have to start paying for coffee?

Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
I know. Yes, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Are you ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably should not - so I will! Oh! Impressive! It's like it's raining!
Pretty cool, right?
But if you think you can put a fish in and he would not be sucked into the mechanism, then you're wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right there.
OK. God, you know, if somebody told me a week ago that I'm going to pee in Joey Tribbiani's apartment?
Yes, life is pretty good, right?
Yes, it is safe!

You know, I think I was sixteen.
Please, just a little off.
I am still on "no".
Uh, morning. Do you think you could close your eyes for a second?
No, no, no, no, I do not fall for that anymore.
What's going on here?
Well, I did a stupid thing last night.
What a stupid thing did you do?
Ewww!

I know.
Do you see, yes.
This is Yasmine Bleeth, she is a very different kind of chick.
I love you both.
But in very different ways.
Hello!
Hello!
(sees that he is watching
I did! But the shop would not take her back! So I took her to the shelter and you know what I found out?
If they can not find a home for them, kill them! And I will not allow that to little Yasmine!
Okay, well, good, good, because, well, because I thought too.
OK. And it's not just girls, you know? They are all sorts of other animals!
That's awful! Well, you did the right thing, man.
Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!

So, Chandler, have you heard of Monica's secret friend?
Uh, yes. She, uh, she, uh, she might have mentioned him.
So, when will we meet this new secret waiter?
Ohh, he's really shy. I do not think he will meet anyone yet.
Yes, I do not think he will meet anyone yet.
I do not care! I want to meet this guy who is the best sex she has ever had!
Really?! Did you hear that? You said that?
I could have said that. Why is that funny?
Because I am very happy for him! And
Hello!
Alright, I just can not think about it now. I just want to say goodbye to my grandmother.
OK.
Okay, let's go, say goodbye.

Hello!
Did you get all the stuff for Joey to drive me out of the apartment?
Honey, if you wanted to do that, you could just bring him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Fish!
It would not have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and me, we'll live together, we're roommates; That's the deal.
Yes, but I wanted you to live with me, but okay, if you have so much fun here
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
We had fun, right?
We made!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Oh, I would like to!
Yes, okay!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Great, all right, okay, and Monica asks me to stop drumming.
Um ... done!

You're, hey, you do not pay for the pizza!
Oh, come on, it's just fair, you paid for the flight. Now is that enough lire?
Ahh, I would throw in a thousand more.
Why, how much is that?
That's about 60 cents.
Okay, it's coffee.
Iced coffee? Tell me, it's iced coffee!
It is hot
Hot coffee!!!
You idiot!!
You'll spill hot coffee over me, huh? !!
What are you just a big, stupid, stupid, dumb idiot, with a goofy idiot hairstyle, right ?!
Huh?
!
What's your favorite food in the summer?
Umm, go to the beach. If it stays really bright late.
Yes
Hello!
Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favorite summer?
Ooh, I do not know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
Oh, that's a good one.

OK, try this salmon mousse.
Mmmm. Well.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
It is creamier.
Yes, well, is that so?
I dont know. We talk about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just glad I'm holding it, you know?
My God! What happened to you?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests ... and what do I learn?
"They are ideally suited for a career in computing for a large multinational."
That's so great! Because you already know how to do that!
Can you believe it? I mean, I do not look like someone who really should do something
Oh Chandler, I know, I know ... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here you go, maybe that will cheer you up.
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better share that with you.

I thought it was a closed coffin.
Well, that does not mean that she can not look good!
Sweeter, do you think you can go in there?
I do not understand why not.
Here is my holder!

Someone in there?
No. This is just part of a daredevil game called "Wait until the last moment before I burst and die".
Man, have you fallen? Hi! So, did you, did you drop yourself?
Someone was in the ladies room, I could not wait. I left the lid open for you.
Do you know what Gunther, go, ah, go ahead, I am - I talk to ah ,. This is the part where you say your name.
Ginger.
Ginger. I talk to Ginger, so ....
Do not you have to use the bathroom?
No, no, I would just ah, I'd rather talk to you.
Yes I will.
Yes, I have to go to the bathroom.
Someone in here.

I'll always go out with him, mother, and you can not do anything about it!
Oh yes, there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? How did you do it with Charles ?!
That was an accident! And you too?
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
Oh my baby!
That was a great scene! And - and - and this blow looks so real! How you do that?
Oh, only years of experience.
Can I get some ice cream here ?!
Oh, anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think it is you.
You are not the fan who dies? Are you?
Say what?
I'm supposed to meet and hug a dying fan, but that's only later!
No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; Yesterday we did a scene together. II am the guy in a coma!
Oh, that was a real person ?!
An-any-I-I just wanted to say that since I catch your brain when you leave the show, I wondered if there are any tips you can give me
II-I-leave the show?
I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?
Who told you that?
Oh, uh, one of the authors.
Which one? Was it bald or was it big?
Umm

Feel better?
Yes!
A lot of!
Listen, not that I'm unsure about my masculinity or what you know, but I think I have to meet with a woman now.
Yes I understand.
Yes! OK! Hello! Hello!
Hello!
You know, you look familiar. Do I know you anywhere?
I do not think so.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on TV. I am an actor
Impressive!
Yes.
Really?!
Hm-mmm.
$ 4.50 please.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.

All right, all right.
It's fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said a word.
Oh god, do something.
Just make contact, smile!
There you go!
You definitely scare here.
Would you like to call someone?
Yes, about 300 people I went to high school with.

OK! Feel free to look, but I tell you, these contracts are not on this desk.
Oh
It's my sister.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway, you know what?
So, when do you imagine you gave it to me? Morning or afternoon?
In the evening. Mr. Zelner came to my office after lunch. He put it on my desk, and then I put in

Phoebe, she does not know you're sneaking up every night, she does not know you're sneaking back every morning, and she does not know you've been living with your grandmother for a week.
Okay, maybe not on these levels.
Hello.
Hello.
I will never find a roommate.
Why, no one good?
Well, let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural.
The spitter.
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy who enjoyed my name so much that he had to make a little noise each time he said it.
Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing
How much more do you have tomorrow?
Two.
This photographer who really seemed boring.
And this actor, whom I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the caller 'Chandler Bing' he said 'whoa-whoa, short message'.
Ross, walk to the ground or do not come over!
Sure, your dresser is missing, but she notices.
What?
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home now, so ...
Um, how are you guys?
Oh, better, actually. You know, I finally figured out why we had so many problems lately.
Really?
Yeah, you know how I have you, well, she does not really have close friends who only belong to her, but last week she met this woman in the studio, Susan something, and they really got it, and I think it will make a difference

Hello!
Hello!
What-what are-what are they?
Oh, just a few pictures I made and hung. I thought they would lighten the place. You do not think?
No no no no!
Well, how - how is it?
That's the way it is.
That's crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without a lab coat and blazer, but you're not in a perfect world, you're in a museum now.
See this scientist in class, he and I used to play together in elementary school all the time, but now Peter!
Hey, Peter!
I am Rhonda!
From PS-129!
I shared my puddin, you man!
I gave you mine
I - I think everyone pretends not to hear you.
Anyway, look, I know nothing about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I spare him a seat, I'll tell you, he
That's okay, I'm cool here. I'll come to you later, Joey.
Op, that's saved. Gift shop.

How is the coffee, darling?
Yes, right away, Mr. Kaplan.
I should not drink coffee, that makes me nervous.
I know!
I bet you think, what's a smart girl who wants to get into fashion and make coffee? Eh?
Op.
Eh.
Oh, you have me.
Well, do not think I did not notice your potential.
Well, I have a project for you that has a lot more to do with fashion.
How does that sound?
Oh that sounds great.
Come on, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you Mr. Kaplan, thank you very much.
Well, I know, I was just, uh, I was just thinking, hoping you might want to get back together?
No thanks.
Oh come on Phoebe would you think about it?
OK. No thanks.
Okay, ah, we'll see you Pheebs.
Wow, that was kind of brutal.
Okay, let that be a lesson for you all, all right.
Once you, as soon as you betray me, I'll be like the ice woman, you know?
Very cold, hard, unyielding, you know nothing,
Yes sure.

Impressive.
I'm really sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry too. But I have to tell you, I'm a little relieved.
Facilitated?
Yes, well, I had a great time with you ... I just can not stand your friends.

she wants
Oh dear God! If you say that again,
Fine!
Fine!
But this separation was not my fault, and she, she says here, "If you take full responsibility ..." Full responsibility!
"... I can trust you again.
Does that seem like something you can do?
Makes it?!
! '
No?
Listen, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel.
If you bring that up now, you will spoil the best that has even happened to you.
Yes I know.
I mean, no, you're right.
Yes, I think I will let it go.
But you - you know how - how hard it is to forget that.
Sure, it's hard to forget!
But that does not mean you have to talk about it!
On this trip, a lot of things happened that we should never talk about.
What the hell happened on this beach ?!
It's between us and the sea, Ross!

I did not think you were gay. I'm doing now.
See my girlfriend - my friend Rachel, she wants to get settled.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for a serious thing.
Oh, you know, that might be okay, even if it was just a fling, that could be all right with Rachel.
Whoa-who-who-whoa! Is that, dear Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, that's her name.
Oh wow! I am free for you!
Oh, wait a second! I did not say that I am not free!
Hey, Chandler, why do not we talk about the ranger game tomorrow?
Wait, you know, me
Well, that's uh, a bit later than me um, I'm generally worried about staying, but for sure!
Maybe we could enjoy an eight-year little Basel Hadens before the game.
Well, I do not really know what that is, but

Monica, let's go. Come on, people, woman in labor.
Hey Ross, look what I have here.
Yes, save it for the taxi, okay.
What do you do? We go to a hospital.
What, can not I see beautiful? There could be doctors.
Joey, get out of the fridge.
Good Good.
What's this?
For the ride.
Yes, like in a taxi ...
Save it.
Okay, I hate that.
Monica, come on. Let's go, baby is coming.
I can not believe it, I will be an aunt. I will have like a nephew.
That's nice. Go out Let's go, come on.
Good, I go. I go.
Here we go, here we go.
Rossy, Rossi.

WHAT IS IT?!
Okay, I - I know, you - you only have - you have a quality.
Yes. Absolute. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, well, because I was worried that you guys might be vague about it.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, Paolo calls from Rome.
Oh dear God! Call from Rome!
So he calls from Rome. I could do that. I just have to go to Rome.
Monica, your dad just started beeping, but can you make it fast? Talk to Rome. I talk to Rome.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.

So, what's up, you came to me yesterday.
Oh, yes, um, alright, I need a divorce.
Oh, yes, yes, sure. We live in the building on the uh sidewalk.
You know it?
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what are you saying, we uh, get together for a drink?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Ben! Ben! Ben!

Give them!
No! They belong to me!
You stole it from me!
You stole them from me !!
Give them!
Do you want to take only one?
Yes that seems to be fair. We never use it.
Look, I really need help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak with a British accent ?! What am I doing?
Well
Why do not you rate it?
Yes, fade the accent out and people will think you know that you are adjusting to life in America.
Yes, I mean, come on Ross, nobody will notice. I mean, they probably do not even listen!
You do not listen to me?
Of course they listen to you! Everyone is listening to you.
Monica, do you really think I should let it run?
I think you look good.

How about Joey ... Pepponi?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a neutral name.
Joey ... Switzerland?
Besides, you know, I think it should be Joe.
You know, Joey makes me sound like I am, I do not know, so big.
Which I am not.
Joe ... Joe ... Joe ... Stalin?
Stalin ... Stalin ... do I know that name? It looks familiar.
Well, it does not ring with me ...
Joe Stalin. You know, that's pretty good.
I want to try Joseph.
Josef Stalin. I think you remember that!
Oh yeah! Bye birdie, with Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the fiddler on the roof.

Are you kidding?
Okay, look.
I-I studied evolution.
Remember evolution?
Monkey in humans?
Besides, I am a doctor and had a monkey.
I am a doctor monkey!
I do not argue with it.
Good, I heard enough. I have made my decision.
They are both idiots.
The joke is not funny and it is offensive to women, doctors and monkeys!
You should not argue about who gets credit, you should argue about who is blamed for having inflicted this terrible joke on the world!
Let it go now!
The joke is shit!
It's your joke.
Is not.

Hey everyone, Rachel was so good today. She did not chatter at all.
I did not!
Even if I found out, okay, so let's just say that I found out about someone and let's just say she'll keep it.
Hey, Pheebs! Check this.
Ooh, you nailed the old lady!
Yes, listen, I thought I was getting better, so I came by this guitar shop on the way home today
Have you, have you?
No.
Give me your hands. String. Give it to me! Choose. Want to learn to play the guitar?
Yes!
Then do not touch one !!
"Really?" You would do that for me ?!
Yes!
Many Thanks!
Alright, we'll start slowly. The only thing you have to do tonight is find the name of your main character.
Done!
And it can not be Joey.
It is not.
Or Joseph.
Oh.

Hello!
Hello! Hey, Pete, you're back! Hey, look at it.
Impressive! Roller skates!
Impressive! They are much more stable than Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. How did you travel?
Well...
Oh, what did you bring ?!
Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.
Oh, these will go into my permanent collection.
Do you want coffee?
Yes, sure, that would be great.
Regular or decaffeinated?
Ah, whatever is closest.
OK.
So ask me what I did today.
So what did you do today, Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I want you to be the chef.
What?! Oh.

Hello.
Hello.
Where have you been?
At the vet.
It will not make you carry one of those big plastic cones, right?
She says Marcel's bouncing thing is not a phase. Apparently he has become sexually mature.
Hello! He hit you.
She says that over time he will become aggressive and violent.
What does that mean?
I will have to give it up.

Oh man! I can not believe I locked myself out again!
Wait for your friend!
Oh dear God! What happened here? Did you do it all?
I really did.
But we have not seen each other since. Well, I'm landing in China, guess who's responsible for the dig.
Julie! Julie, is not that great? I mean, is not that just the kick-in-the-step, spit on your neck awesome?

May I come inside?
Uh, yes, if you want.
Do
Yes sure?
Me too.
Okay Rach, before anything happens, I just want to set a few basic rules.
That's just tonight.
I will not go through this when it raises the question of "Us."
OK?
I just want it to be what it is!
And what's that for a steed?
The physical act of love.
What?! Are you crazy?
Oh, you did not just try to seduce me with your - your nakedness?
Oh God, you saw me ?! Oh!
You did not try to seduce me with your nakedness.
No !! No! You thought you really thought I wanted to have sex with you ?!
No! No! No! No no no no.
Oh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross, you threw your shoes out!
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Everything is good! Okay bye Mon! She - she will kill me.
Yes, the phone was directed the other way. And that goes up there.

Ah, Joey.
Joey Tribbiani.
Listen to Joey, I have a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he has a relationship crisis and can not get out of Long Island.
So, does that mean the audition is over?
Listen to Joey, since you have the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
What?!
Oh, come on Joey, it's easy.
You know it's hand, hand, head, head, top, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slip back, step, step, step and jazz hands!
It is ah, stepity, step and jazz hands.
Have fun.
Bye.

Impressive! Luckily she has one
Oh, I can not believe that! My womb is an inhospitable environment? I tried very hard to be a good host!
Oh, I can not believe that my sperm have a low mobility, because, let me tell you, when I grew up, they seem to be really in a hurry to get seats!
!
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm sorry that there was no better news from your test last week, but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
OK.
First of all, although your chances of receiving by natural means are not great, you never know!
So, have regular sex.
Oh damn!
Do not worry, after a while he will turn it off.
Considering your situation, the options with the greatest chance of success would be surrogacy or fertilization with a sperm donor.
OK.
Well, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking
Fine. Good, good, now you will never know.
We're kidding. Come on, tell us!
Yes! Come on!
Alright. There is a theory that Richard Leakey

Hello, is uh, is Carol here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Oh, I uh, just came over to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but ...
Come in!
Many Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class and I have to bring it back to the museum.
How does it look like?
A bit like a big, skinless face.
Yes, I know the concept. We can just search for it.
OK. Wow, you certainly have a lot of books about being lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise they will not let you do that.
Hey, hey, Yertle the turtle. A classic.
Actually, I read it to the baby.
The er, the baby that was not born yet? Would not that mean that you are ... crazy?
What, you do not think they can hear sounds there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really ... are you really talking to her?
I have no idea what you just said.
Put Joey on the phone.
What is going on man?
I'm trppd ... in an ATM vstbl ... wth
Oh dear God! He is trapped in an ATM hall with Jill Goodacre! Kramer, listen.
Yes, that thought never crossed my mind.

and that was all before 10 o'clock.
The caterer rang and said it would be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
And then the florist called to say that there are no tulips.
Oh, and the Chilliest has Carpel-Tunel syndrome.
We will not be
Whoa-who-whoa! Emily, darling, okay?
Well, yours too!

Where is Chandler?
Ah, he can not do it, he said he had his ... Whoa-oh!
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Joey I can see you okay? You hide behind the coats.
Okay, listen, just give me everything I can do two.
Well, if you have nothing to copy, why are you going down?
Yeah, are you just going down to take a look at the hot girl with the belly button ring?
Yes! Do you want to come?
Yes!

Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Well. We will go. It's not for another six hours. We will go then.

Hello.
What's happening?
Someone in the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck !!
Oh, Willie is still alive!
What are you doing right now?
Oh, my mother called, they will publish our engagement message in the local newspaper, so we are looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who goes like this
Oh dear God! That's the hangover you're in the world with
I do not know what it is, I just can not get a good picture.
Oh, this is a great one.
Yes, I am not there.
I know, but look at me: very brown.
Hey, why do not you make portraits of professional photographers?
That's a good idea! I bet you have one of these wind machines! You know
Yes that is great! Besides, Chandler will not look so stupid.
Chandler what are you saying?
Alright, but I should warn you, I'm not leaving. I go.
